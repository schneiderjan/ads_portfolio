    "Nowadays, newspapers and magazines are full with infographics and data visualizations. But still some articles choose not to use any, but could very well use one or two.\n",

    "Your task is to add (at least) **two** infographics/data visualizations to this New Yorker article. Browse the text and find a greatly missed opportunity for a graphic, then using data from the text and if needed your own imagination, create one. You are free in choosing a tool. If you use Python then add your source code below. ** Explain the design choices you've made in detail, like in assignment 1! ** Also answer the question what the plot wants to show or explain and how your design helps with that.\n",
