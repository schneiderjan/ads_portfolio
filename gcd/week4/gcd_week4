How do you calculate the vote displayed on a film or show page?
We take all the individual
 votes cast by IMDb registered users and use them to calculate a single rating. We don't use the
 arithmetic mean of the votes (although we do display the mean and average votes on the votes breakdown)
 -- the rating displayed on a film's page is a weighted average. To display the detailed votes breakdown,
 click on the 'More' link located below the existing user rating. For an example, see here.
