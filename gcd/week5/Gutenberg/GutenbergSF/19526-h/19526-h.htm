<h2><a name="CHAPTER_1" id="CHAPTER_1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p>"Stand to, you rocket wash!"</p>

<p>A harsh, bull-throated roar thundered over the platform
of the monorail station at Space Academy and suddenly
the lively chatter and laughter of more than a
hundred boys was stilled. Tumbling out of the gleaming
monorail cars, they froze to quick attention, their eyes
turned to the main exit ramp.</p>

<p>They saw a short, squat, heavily built man, wearing
the scarlet uniform of the enlisted Solar Guard, staring
down at them, his fists jammed into his hips and his feet
spread wide apart. He stood there a moment, his sharp
eyes flicking over the silent clusters, then slowly sauntered
down the ramp toward them with a strangely
light, catfooted tread.</p>

<p>"Form up! Column of fours!"</p>

<p>Almost before the echoes of the thunderous voice
died down, the scattered groups of boys had formed
themselves into four ragged lines along the platform.</p>

<p>The scarlet-clad figure stood before them, his seamed
and weather-beaten face set in stern lines. But there was
a glint of laughter in his eyes as he noticed the grotesque
and sometimes tortuous positions of some of the
boys as they braced themselves in what they considered
a military pose.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span></p>

<p>Every year, for the last ten years, he had met the
trains at the monorail station. Every year, he had seen
boys in their late teens, gathered from Earth, Mars and
Venus, three planets millions of miles apart. They were
dressed in many different styles of clothes; the loose
flowing robes of the lads from the Martian deserts; the
knee-length shorts and high stockings of the boys from
the Venusian jungles; the vari-colored jacket and trouser
combinations of the boys from the magnificent Earth
cities. But they all had one thing in common&mdash;a dream.
All had visions of becoming Space Cadets, and later,
officers in the Solar Guard. Each dreamed of the day
when he would command rocket ships that patrolled
the space lanes from the outer edges of Pluto to the twilight
zone of Mercury. They were all the same.</p>

<p>"All right now! Let's get squared away!" His voice
was a little more friendly now. "My name's McKenny&mdash;Mike
McKenny. Warrant Officer&mdash;Solar Guard. See
these hash marks?"</p>

<p>He suddenly held out a thick arm that bulged against
the tight red sleeve. From the wrists to the elbow, the
lines of boys could see a solid corrugation of white V-shaped
stripes.</p>

<p>"Each one of these marks represents four years in
space," he continued. "There's ten marks here and I intend
making it an even dozen! And no bunch of Earthworms
is going to make me lose the chance to get those
last two by trying to make a space monkey out of me!"</p>

<p>McKenny sauntered along the line of boys with that
same strange catlike step and looked squarely into the
eyes of each boy in turn.</p>

<p>"Just to keep the record straight, I'm your cadet supervisor.
I handle you until you either wash out and go
home, or you finally blast off and become spacemen. If
you stub your toe or cut your finger, come to me. If you
get homesick, come to me. And if you get into trouble"&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>paused momentarily&mdash;"don't bother because
I'll be looking for <i>you</i>, with a fist full of demerits!"</p>

<p>McKenny continued his slow inspection of the ranks,
then suddenly stopped short. At the far end of the line,
a tall, ruggedly built boy of about eighteen, with curly
brown hair and a pleasant, open face, was stirring uncomfortably.
He slowly reached down toward his right
boot and held it, while he wriggled his foot into it. McKenny
quickly strode over and planted himself firmly in
front of the boy.</p>

<p>"When I say stand to, I mean stand to!" he roared.</p>

<p>The boy jerked himself erect and snapped to attention.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm sorry, sir," he stammered. "But my boot&mdash;it
was coming off and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care if your pants are falling down, an order's
an order!"</p>

<p>The boy gulped and reddened as a nervous titter rippled
through the ranks. McKenny spun around and
glared. There was immediate silence.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" He turned back to the boy.</p>

<p>"Corbett, sir. Cadet Candidate Tom Corbett," answered
the boy.</p>

<p>"Wanta be a spaceman, do ya?" asked Mike, pushing
his jaw out another inch.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Been studying long hard hours in primary school, eh?
Talked your mother and father deaf in the ears to let
you come to Space Academy and be a spaceman! You
want to feel those rockets bucking in your back out in
the stars? <i>EH?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom, wondering how this man he
didn't even know could know so much about him.</p>

<p>"<i>Well, you won't make it</i> if I ever catch you disobeying
orders again!"</p>

<p>McKenny turned quickly to see what effect he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>created on the others. The lines of bewildered faces satisfied
him that his old trick of using one of the cadets as
an example was a success. He turned back to Corbett.</p>

<p>"The only reason I'm not logging you now is because
you're not a Space Cadet yet&mdash;and won't be, until
you've taken the Academy oath!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>McKenny walked down the line and across the platform
to an open teleceiver booth. The ranks were quiet
and motionless, and as he made his call, McKenny
smiled. Finally, when the tension seemed unbearable,
he roared, "At ease!" and closed the door of the
booth.</p>

<p>The ranks melted immediately and the boys fell into
chattering clusters, their voices low, and they occasionally
peered over their shoulders at Corbett as if he had
suddenly been stricken with a horrible plague.</p>

<p>Brooding over the seeming ill-fortune that had called
McKenny's attention to him at the wrong time, Tom sat
down on his suitcase to adjust his boot. He shook his
head slowly. He had heard Space Academy was tough,
tougher than any other school in the world, but he
didn't expect the stern discipline to begin so soon.</p>

<p>"This could be the beginning of the end," drawled a
lazy voice in back of Tom, "for some of the more enthusiastic
cadets." Someone laughed.</p>

<p>Tom turned to see a boy about his own age, weight
and height, with close-cropped blond hair that stood up
brushlike all over his head. He was lounging idly
against a pillar, luggage piled high around his feet. Tom
recognized him immediately as Roger Manning, and his
pleasant features twisted into a scowl.</p>

<p>"About what I'd expect from that character," he
thought, "after the trick he pulled on Astro, that big
fellow from Venus."</p>

<p>Tom's thoughts were of the night before, when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
connecting links of transportation from all over the
Solar Alliance had deposited the boys in the Central
Station at Atom City where they were to board the
monorail express for the final lap to Space Academy.</p>

<p>Manning, as Tom remembered it, had taken advantage
of the huge Venusian by tricking him into carrying
his luggage. Reasoning that since the gravity of
Venus was considerably less than that of Earth, he convinced
Astro that he needed the extra weight to maintain
his balance. It had been a cheap trick, but no one
had wanted to challenge the sharpness of Manning's
tongue and come to Astro's rescue. Tom had wanted
to, but refrained when he saw that Astro didn't mind.</p>

<p>Finishing his conversation on the teleceiver, McKenny
stepped out of the booth and faced the boys
again.</p>

<p>"All right," he bawled. "They're all set for you at the
Academy! Pick up your gear and follow me!" With a
quick light step, he hopped on the rolling slidewalk at
the edge of the platform and started moving away.</p>

<p>"Hey, Astro!" Roger Manning stopped the huge boy
about to step over. "Going to carry my bags?"</p>

<p>The Venusian, a full head taller, hesitated and looked
doubtfully at the four suitcases at Roger's feet.</p>

<p>"Come on," prodded Roger in a tone of mock good
nature. "The gravity around here is the same as in
Atom City. It's the same all over the face of the Earth.
Wouldn't want you to just fly away." He snickered and
looked around, winking broadly.</p>

<p>Astro still hesitated, "I don't know, Manning. I&mdash;uhh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the rings of Saturn! What's going on here?" Suddenly
from outside the ring of boys that had gathered
around, McKenny came roaring in, bulling his way to
the center of the group to face Roger and Astro.</p>

<p>"I have a strained wrist, sir," began Roger smoothly.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>"And this cadet candidate"&mdash;he nodded casually toward
Astro&mdash;"offered to carry my luggage. Now he refuses."</p>

<p>Mike glared at Astro. "Did you agree to carry this
man's luggage?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I&mdash;ah&mdash;" fumbled Astro.</p>

<p>"Well? Did you or didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I guess I sorta did, sir," replied Astro, his face turning
a slow red.</p>

<p>"I don't hold with anyone doing another man's work,
but if a Solar Guard officer, a Space Cadet, or even a
cadet candidate gives his word he'll do something, he
does it!" McKenny shook a finger in Astro's face, reaching
up to do it. "Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the embarrassed reply.</p>

<p>McKenny turned to Manning who stood listening, a
faint smile playing on his lips.</p>

<p>"What's your name, Mister?"</p>

<p>"Manning. Roger Manning," he answered easily.</p>

<p>"So you've got a strained wrist, have you?" asked
Mike mockingly while sending a sweeping glance from
top to bottom of the gaudy colored clothes.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Can't carry your own luggage, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Roger evenly. "I could carry my own
luggage. I thought the candidate from Venus might
give me a helping hand. Nothing more. I certainly
didn't intend for him to become a marked man for a
simple gesture of comradeship." He glanced past McKenny
toward the other boys and added softly, "And
comradeship <i>is</i> the spirit of Space Academy, isn't it,
sir?"</p>

<p>His face suddenly crimson, McKenny spluttered,
searching for a ready answer, then turned away abruptly.</p>

<p>"What are you all standing around for?" he roared.
"Get your gear and yourselves over on that slidewalk!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Blast!" He turned once again to the rolling platform.
Manning smiled at Astro and hopped nimbly onto the
slidewalk after McKenny, leaving his luggage in a heap
in front of Astro.</p>

<p>"And be careful with that small case, Astro," he
called as he drifted away.</p>

<p>"Here, Astro," said Tom. "I'll give you a hand."</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied Astro grimly. "I can carry
'em."</p>

<p>"No, let me help." Tom bent over&mdash;then suddenly
straightened. "By the way, we haven't introduced ourselves.
My name's Corbett&mdash;Tom Corbett." He stuck
out his hand. Astro hesitated, sizing up the curly-headed
boy in front of him, who stood smiling and offering
friendship. Finally he pushed out his own hand
and smiled back at Tom.</p>

<p>"Astro, but you know that by now."</p>

<p>"That sure was a dirty deal Manning gave you."</p>

<p>"Ah, I don't mind carrying his bags. It's just that I
wanted to tell him he's going to have to send it all back.
They don't allow a candidate to keep more than a
toothbrush at the Academy."</p>

<p>"Guess he'll find out the hard way."</p>

<p>Carrying Manning's luggage as well as their own,
they finally stepped on the slidewalk and began the
smooth easy ride from the monorail station to the
Academy. Both having felt the sharpness of Manning's
tongue, and both having been dressed down by Warrant
Officer McKenny, they seemed to be linked by a
bond of trouble and they stood close together for mutual
comfort.</p>

<p>As the slidewalk whisked them silently past the few
remaining buildings and credit exchanges that nestled
around the monorail station, Tom gave thought to his
new life.</p>

<p>Ever since Jon Builker, the space explorer, returning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
from the first successful flight to a distant galaxy, came
through his home town near New Chicago twelve years
before, Tom had wanted to be a spaceman. Through
high school and the New Chicago Primary Space
School where he had taken his first flight above Earth's
atmosphere, he had waited for the day when he would
pass his entrance exams and be accepted as a cadet
candidate in Space Academy. For no reason at all, a
lump rose in his throat, as the slidewalk rounded a
curve and he saw for the first time, the gleaming white
magnificence of the Tower of Galileo. He recognized it
immediately from the hundreds of books he had read
about the Academy and stared wordlessly.</p>

<p>"Sure is pretty, isn't it?" asked Astro, his voice
strangely husky.</p>

<p>"Yeah," breathed Tom in reply. "It sure is." He could
only stare at the shimmering tower ahead.</p>

<p>"It's all I've ever wanted to do," said Tom at length.
"Just get out there and&mdash;be <i>free</i>!"</p>

<p>"I know what you mean. It's the greatest feeling in
the world."</p>

<p>"You say that as if you've already been up there."</p>

<p>Astro grinned. "Yup. Used to be an enlisted space
sailor. Bucked rockets in an old freighter on the Luna
City&mdash;Venusport run."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you doing here?" Tom was amazed
and impressed.</p>

<p>"Simple. I want to be an officer. I want to get into
the Solar Guard and handle the power-push in one of
those cruisers."</p>

<p>Tom's eyes glowed with renewed admiration for his
new friend. "I've been out four or five times but only in
jet boats five hundred miles out. Nothing like a jump
to Luna City or Venusport."</p>

<p>By now the slidewalk had carried them past the base
of the Tower of Galileo to a large building facing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Academy quadrangle and the spell was broken by McKenny's
bull-throated roar.</p>

<p>"Haul off, you blasted polliwogs!"</p>

<p>As the boys jumped off the slidewalk, a cadet, dressed
in the vivid blue that Tom recognized as the official
dress of the Senior Cadet Corps, walked up to McKenny
and spoke to him quietly. The warrant officer turned
back to the waiting group and gave rapid orders.</p>

<p>"By twos, follow Cadet Herbert inside and he'll assign
you to your quarters. Shower, shave if you have to
and can find anything to shave, and dress in the uniform
that'll be supplied you. Be ready to take the Academy
oath at"&mdash;he paused and glanced at the senior
cadet who held up three fingers&mdash;"fifteen hundred
hours. That's three o'clock. All clear? Blast off!"</p>

<p>Just as the boys began to move, there was a sudden
blasting roar in the distance. The noise expanded and
rolled across the hills surrounding Space Academy. It
thundered over the grassy quadrangle, vibrating waves
of sound one on top of the other, until the very air quivered
under the impact.</p>

<p>Mouths open, eyes popping, the cadet candidates
stood rooted in their tracks and stared as, in the distance,
a long, thin, needlelike ship seemed to balance
delicately on a column of flame, then suddenly shoot
skyward and disappear.</p>

<p>"Pull in your eyeballs!" McKenny's voice crackled
over the receding thunder. "You'll fly one of those firecrackers
some day. But right now you're <i>Earthworms</i>,
the lowest form of animal life in the Academy!"</p>

<p>As the boys snapped to attention again, Tom thought
he caught a faint smile on Cadet Herbert's face as he
stood to one side waiting for McKenny to finish his
tirade. Suddenly he snapped his back straight, turned
sharply and stepped through the wide doors of the
building. Quickly the double line of boys followed.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>"Did you see that, Astro?" asked Tom excitedly.
"That was a Solar Guard patrol ship!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know," replied Astro. The big candidate
from Venus scratched his chin and eyed Tom bashfully.
"Say, Tom&mdash;ah, since we sort of know each other, how
about us trying to get in the same quarters?"</p>

<p>"O.K. by me, Astro, if we can," said Tom, grinning
back at his friend.</p>

<p>The line pressed forward to Cadet Herbert, who was
now waiting at the bottom of the slidestairs, a mesh
belt that spiraled upward in a narrow well to the upper
stories of the building. Speaking into an audioscriber,
a machine that transmitted his spoken words into typescript,
he repeated the names of the candidates as they
passed.</p>

<p>"Cadet Candidate Tom Corbett," announced Tom,
and Herbert repeated it into the audioscriber.</p>

<p>"Cadet Candidate Astro!" The big Venusian stepped
forward.</p>

<p>"What's the rest of it, Mister?" inquired Herbert.</p>

<p>"That's all. Just Astro."</p>

<p>"No other names?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Astro. "You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't say 'sir' to a senior cadet, Mister. And
we're not interested in why you have only one name!"
Herbert snapped.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;uhh&mdash;Mister." Astro flushed and joined
Tom.</p>

<p>"Cadet Candidate Philip Morgan," announced the
next boy.</p>

<p>Herbert repeated the name into the machine, then
announced, "Cadet Candidates Tom Corbett, Astro, and
Philip Morgan assigned to Section 42-D."</p>

<p>Turning to the three boys, he indicated the spiraling
slidestairs. "Forty-second floor. You'll find Section D in
the starboard wing."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>Astro and Tom immediately began to pile Manning's
luggage to one side of the slidestairs.</p>

<p>"Take your luggage with you, Misters!" snapped Herbert.</p>

<p>"It isn't ours," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Isn't yours?" Herbert glanced over the pile of suitcases
and turned back to Tom. "Whose is it then?"</p>

<p>"Belongs to Cadet Candidate Roger Manning," replied
Tom.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with it?"</p>

<p>"We were carrying it for him."</p>

<p>"Do we have a candidate in the group who finds it
necessary to provide himself with valet service?"</p>

<p>Herbert moved along the line of boys.</p>

<p>"Will Cadet Candidate Roger Manning please step
forward?"</p>

<p>Roger slid from behind a group of boys to face the
senior cadet's cold stare.</p>

<p>"Roger Manning here," he presented himself
smoothly.</p>

<p>"Is that your luggage?" Herbert jerked his thumb
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>Roger smiled confidently, but Herbert merely stared
coldly.</p>

<p>"You have a peculiar attitude for a candidate, Manning."</p>

<p>"Is there a prescribed attitude, Mr. Herbert?" Roger
asked, his smile broadening. "If there is, I'll be only
too glad to conform to it."</p>

<p>Herbert's face twitched almost imperceptibly. Then
he nodded, made a notation on a pad and returned to
his post at the head of the gaping line of boys. "From
now on, Candidate Manning, you will be responsible
for your own belongings."</p>

<p>Tom, Astro, and Philip Morgan stepped on the slidestairs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and began their spiraling ascent to the forty-second floor.</p>

<p>"I saw what happened at the monorail station,"
drawled the third member of Section 42-D, leaning
against the bannister of the moving belt. "By the craters
of Luna, that Manning felluh sure is a hot operator."</p>

<p>"We found out for ourselves," grunted Astro.</p>

<p>"Say, since we're all bunkin' togethuh, let's get to
knowin' each othuh. My name's Phil Morgan, come
from Georgia. Where you all from?"</p>

<p>"New Chicago," replied Tom. "Name's Tom Corbett.
And this is Astro."</p>

<p>"Hiya." Astro stuck out a big paw and grinned his
wide grin. "I guess you heard. Astro's all the name I've
got."</p>

<p>"How come?" inquired the Southerner.</p>

<p>"I'm from Venus and it's a custom from way back
when Venus was first colonized to just hand out one
name."</p>

<p>"Funny custom," drawled Phil.</p>

<p>Astro started to say something and then stopped,
clamping his lips together. Tom could see his face turn
a slow pink. Phil saw it too, and hastily added:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I didn't mean anything. I&mdash;ah&mdash;" he broke off,
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Forget it, Phil." Astro grinned again.</p>

<p>"Say," interjected Tom. "Look at that!"</p>

<p>They all turned to look at the floor they were passing.
Near the edge of the step-off platform on the fourth
floor was an oaken panel, inscribed with silver lettering
in relief. As they drew even with the plaque, they
caught sight of someone behind them. They turned to
see Manning, the pile of suitcases in front of him,
reading aloud.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>" ... to the brave men who sacrificed their lives
in the conquest of space, this Galaxy Hall is dedicated...."</p>

<p>"Say, this must be the museum," said Tom. "Here's
where they have all the original gear used in the first
space hops."</p>

<p>"Absolutely right," said Manning with a smile.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we could get off and take a look?" Astro
asked.</p>

<p>"Sure you can," said Roger. "In fact, the Academy
regs say every cadet must inspect the exhibits in the
space museum within the first week."</p>

<p>The members of Section 42-D looked at Roger questioningly.</p>

<p>"I don't know if we have time." Tom was dubious.</p>

<p>"Sure you have&mdash;plenty. I'd hop off and take a look
myself but I've got to get this junk ready to ship home."
He indicated the pile of bags in front of him.</p>

<p>"Aw, come on, Tom, let's take a look!" urged Astro.
"They have the old <i>Space Queen</i> in here, the first ship
to clear Earth's gravity. Boy, I'd sure like to see her!"
Without waiting for the others to agree, the huge candidate
stepped off the slidestairs.</p>

<p>"Hey, Astro!" yelled Tom. "Wait! I don't think&mdash;"
His voice trailed off as the moving stair carried him
up to the next floor.</p>

<p>But then a curious thing happened. As other boys
came abreast of the museum floor and saw Astro they
began to get off and follow him, wandering around
gazing at the relics of the past.</p>

<p>Soon nearly half of the cadet candidates were standing
in silent awe in front of the battered hull of the
<i>Space Queen</i>, the first atomic-powered rocket ship allowed
on exhibition only fifty years before because of
the deadly radioactivity in her hull, created when a
lead baffle melted in midspace and flooded the ship
with murderous gamma rays.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>They stood in front of the spaceship and listened
while Astro, in a hushed voice, read the inscription on
the bronze tablet.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Earth to Luna and return. 7th March 2051. In
honor of the brave men of the first atomic-powered
spaceship to land successfully on the planet Moon, only
to perish on return to Earth...."</p>

<p>"Candidates&mdash;staaaaaaaaannnnnd <i>too</i>!"</p>

<p>Like a clap of thunder Warrant Officer McKenny's
voice jarred the boys out of their silence. He stepped
forward like a bantam rooster and faced the startled
group of boys.</p>

<p>"I wanna know just <i>one</i> thing! Who stepped off that
slidestairs <i>first</i>?"</p>

<p>The boys all hesitated.</p>

<p>"I guess I was the first, sir," said Astro, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"Oh, you guess you were, eh?" roared McKenny.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath McKenny launched into a
blistering tirade. His choice of words were to be long
remembered by the group and repeated to succeeding
classes. Storming against the huge Venusian like a
pygmy attacking an elephant, McKenny roared, berated
and blasted.</p>

<p>Later, when Astro finally reached his quarters and
changed into the green coveralls of the cadet candidates,
Tom and Phil crowded around him.</p>

<p>"It was Roger, blast him!" said Tom angrily. "He was
getting back at you because Cadet Herbert made him
carry his own gear."</p>

<p>"I asked for it," grumbled Astro. "Ah, I should've
known better. But I just couldn't wait to see the
<i>Queen</i>." He balled his huge hands into tight knots and
stared at the floor.</p>

<p>"Now hear this!!!"</p>

<p>A voice suddenly rasped over the PA system loud-speaker
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
above the door. "All cadet candidates will
come to attention to receive the Space Academy oath
from Commander Walters." The voice paused. "<i>AT-TENT-SHUN!</i>
Cadet candidates&mdash;Staaaaannnnd <i>TO</i>!"</p>

<p>"This is Commander Walters speaking!" A deep,
powerful voice purred through the speaker. "The Academy
oath is taken individually.</p>

<p>"It is something each candidate locks in his spirit,
his mind and his heart. That is why it is taken in your
quarters. The oath is not a show of color, it is a way
of life. Each candidate will face as closely as possible
in the direction of his home and swear by his own
individual God as he repeats after me."</p>

<p>Astro stepped quickly to the window port and gazed
into the blue heavens, eyes searching out the misty
planet Venus. Phil Morgan thought a moment, and
faced toward the wall with the inlaid star chart of the
sky, thinking of sun-bathed Georgia. Tom Corbett
stared straight at a blank wall.</p>

<p>Each boy did not see what was in front of him yet
he saw further, perhaps, than he had ever seen before.
He looked into a future which held the limitlessness of
the universe and new worlds and planets to be lifted
out of the oblivion of uncharted depths of space to
come.</p>

<p>They repeated slowly....</p>

<p>" ... I solemnly swear to uphold the Constitution
of the Solar Alliance, to obey interplanetary law, to
protect the liberties of the planets, to safeguard the
freedom of space and to uphold the cause of peace
throughout the universe ... to this end, I dedicate
my life!"

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2" id="CHAPTER_2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>


<p>Tom Corbett's first day at Space Academy began at
0530 hours with the blaring of the <i>Cadet Corps Song</i>
over the central communicators:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"<i>From the rocket fields of the Academy</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>To the far-flung stars of outer space,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>We're Space Cadets training to be</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Ready for dangers we may face.</i><br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>Up in the sky, rocketing past</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Higher than high, faster than fast,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Out into space, into the sun</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Look at her go when we give her the gun.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>From the rocket fields of the</i>...."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Within sixty seconds, the buildings of the Academy
rocked with the impact of three thousand voices singing
the last stanza. Lights flashed on in every window.
Cadets raced through the halls and across the quadrangle.
The central communicator began the incessant
mustering of cadets, and the never-ending orders of
the day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
" ... Unit 38-Z report to Captain Edwards for astrogation.
Unit 68-E report to Commander Walters for
special assignments."</p>

<p>On and on, down the list of senior cadets, watch officers,
and the newly arrived Earthworms. Units and
individuals to report for training or study in everything
from ground assembly of an atomic rocket motor, to
the history of the founding of the Solar Alliance, the
governing body of the tri-planet civilization.</p>

<p>Tom Corbett stepped out of the shower in Section
42-D and bellowed at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"Hit the deck, Astro! Make use of the gravity!" He
tugged at an outsized foot dangling over the side of an
upper bunk.</p>

<p>"Uhhhh-ahhhh-hummmmm," groaned the cadet
from Venus and tried to go back to sleep.</p>

<p>Philip Morgan stepped into the shower, turned on
the cold water, screeched at the top of his voice, gradually
trailing off into countless repetitions of the last
verse of the Academy song.</p>

<p>"Damp your tubes, you blasted space monkey,"
roared Astro, sitting up bleary-eyed.</p>

<p>"What time do we eat?" asked Tom, pulling on the
green one-piece coverall of the Earthworm cadet candidates.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Astro, opening his mouth in
a cavernous yawn. "But it'd better be soon. I like space,
but not between my backbone and my stomach!"</p>

<p>Warrant Officer McKenny burst into the room and
began to compete with the rest of the noise outside the
buildings.</p>

<p>"Five minutes to the dining hall and you'd better not
be late! Take the slidestairs down to the twenty-eighth
floor. Tell the mess cadet in charge of the hall your unit
number and he'll show you to the right table. Remember
where it is, because you'll have to find it yourself
after that, or not eat. Finish your breakfast and report
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to the ninety-ninth floor to Dr. Dale at seven hundred
hours!"</p>

<p>And as fast as he had arrived, he was gone, a flash of
red color with rasping voice trailing behind.</p>

<p>Exactly one hour and ten minutes later, promptly
at seven o'clock, the three members of Unit 42-D stood
at attention in front of Dr. Joan Dale, along with the
rest of the green-clad cadets.</p>

<p>When the catcalls and wolf whistles had died away,
Dr. Dale, pretty, trim, and dressed in the gold and
black uniform of the Solar Guard, held up her hand and
motioned for the cadets to sit down.</p>

<p>"My answer to your&mdash;" she paused, smiled and continued,
"your enthusiastic welcome is simply&mdash;thank
you. But we'll have no further repetitions. This is Space
Academy&mdash;not a primary school!"</p>

<p>Turning abruptly, she stood beside a round desk in
the well of an amphitheater, and held up a thin tube
about an inch in diameter and twelve inches long.</p>

<p>"We will now begin your classification tests," she
said. "You will receive one of these tubes. Inside, you
will find four sheets of paper. You are to answer all the
questions on each paper and place them back in the
tube. Take the tube and drop it in the green outline
slot in this wall."</p>

<p>She indicated a four-inch-round hole to her left, outlined
with green paint. Beside it, was another slot
outlined with red paint. "Remain there until the
tube is returned to you in the red slot. Take it back
to your desk." She paused and glanced down at her
desk.</p>

<p>"Now, there are four possible classifications for a
cadet. Control-deck officer, which includes leadership
and command. Astrogation officer, which includes radar
and communications. And power-deck officer for
engine-room operations. The fourth classification is for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
advanced scientific study here at the Academy. Your
papers are studied by an electronic calculator that has
proven infallible. You must make at least a passing
grade on each of the four classifications."</p>

<p>Dr. Dale looked up at the rows of upturned, unsmiling
faces and stepped from the dais, coming to a
halt near the first desk.</p>

<p>"I know that all of you here have your hearts set on
becoming spacemen, officers in the Solar Guard. Most
of you want to be space pilots. But there must be astrogators,
radar engineers, communication officers and
power-deck operators on each ship, and," she paused,
braced her shoulders and added, "some of you will not
be accepted for any of these. Some of you will wash
out."</p>

<p>Dr. Dale turned her back on the cadets, not wanting
to look at the sudden pallor that washed over their
faces. It was brutal, she thought, this test. Why bring
them all the way to the Academy and then give the
tests? Why not start the entrance exams at the beginning
with the classification and aptitude? But she
knew the answer even before the thoughtful question
was completed. Under the fear of being washed out,
the weaker ones would not pass. The Solar Guard
could not afford to have cadets and later Solar Guard
officers who could not function under pressure.</p>

<p>She began handing out the tubes and, one by one,
the green-clad candidates stepped to the front of the
room to receive them.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Ma'am," said one cadet falteringly.
"If&mdash;if&mdash;I wash out as a cadet&mdash;as a Solar Guard officer
cadet"&mdash;he gulped several times&mdash;"does that mean there
isn't any chance of becoming a spaceman?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered kindly. "You can become a member
of the enlisted Solar Guard, if you can pass the
acceleration tests."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thank you, Ma'am," replied the boy and turned
away nervously.</p>

<p>Tom Corbett accepted the tube and hurried back to
his seat. He knew that this was the last hurdle. He did
not know that the papers had been prepared individually,
the tests given on the basis of the entrance exams
he had taken back at New Chicago Primary Space
School.</p>

<p>He opened the tube, pulling out the four sheets,
printed on both sides of the paper, and read the heading
on the first: ASTROGATION, COMMUNICATIONS,
SIGNALS (<i>Radar</i>)</p>

<p>He studied the first question.</p>

<p>" ... What is the range of the Mark Nine radar-scope,
and how far can a spaceship be successfully distinguished
from other objects in space?..."</p>

<p>He read the question four times, then pulled out a
pencil and began to write.</p>

<p>Only the rustle of the papers, or the occasional sigh
of a cadet over a problem, disturbed the silence in the
high-ceilinged room, as the hundred-odd cadets fought
the questions.</p>

<p>There was a sudden stir in the room and Tom looked
up to see Roger Manning walk to the slot and casually
deposit his tube in the green-bordered slot. Then he
leaned idly against the wall waiting for it to be returned.
As he stood there, he spoke to Dr. Dale, who
smiled and replied. There was something about his
attitude that made Tom boil. So fast? He glanced at
his own papers. He had hardly finished two sheets
and thought he was doing fine. He clenched his teeth
and bent over the paper again, redoubling his efforts
to triangulate a fix on Regulus by using dead reckoning
as a basis for his computations.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tall man, wearing the uniform of a Solar
Guard officer, appeared in the back of the room. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Dr. Dale looked up and smiled a greeting, he placed
his finger on his lips. Steve Strong, Captain in the Solar
Guard, gazed around the room at the backs bent over
busy pencils. He did not smile, remembering how, only
fifteen years before, he had gone through the same torture,
racking his brains trying to adjust the measurements
of a magnascope prism. He was joined by a thin
handsome young man, Lieutenant Judson Saminsky,
and finally, Warrant Officer McKenny. They nodded
silently in greeting. It would be over soon. Strong
glanced at the clock over the desk. Another ten minutes
to go.</p>

<p>The line of boys at the slots grew until more than
twenty stood there, each waiting patiently, nervously,
for his turn to drop the tube in the slot and receive in
return the sealed cylinder that held his fate.</p>

<p>Still at his desk, his face wet with sweat, Astro looked
at the question in front of him for the fifteenth time.</p>

<p>" ... Estimate the time it would take a 300-ton
rocket ship with half-filled tanks, cruising at the most
economical speed to make a trip from Titan to Venusport.
(a) Estimate size and maximum capacity of fuel
tanks. (b) Give estimate of speed ship would utilize...."</p>

<p>He thought. He slumped in his chair. He stared at
the ceiling. He chewed his pencil....</p>

<p>Five seats away, Tom stacked his examination sheets
neatly, twisted them into a cylinder and inserted them
in the tube. As he passed the line of desks and headed
for the slot, a hand caught his arm. Tom turned to see
Roger Manning grinning at him.</p>

<p>"Worried, spaceboy?" asked Roger easily. Tom didn't
answer. He simply withdrew his arm.</p>

<p>"You know," said Roger, "you're really a nice kid.
It's a shame you won't make it. But the rules specifically
say 'no cabbageheads.'"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>"No talking!" Dr. Dale called sharply from her desk.</p>

<p>Tom walked away and stood in the line at the slots.
He found himself wanting to pass more than anything
in the world. "Please," he breathed, "please, just let me
pass&mdash;"</p>

<p>A soft gong began to sound. Dr. Dale stood up.</p>

<p>"Time's up," she announced. "Please put your papers
in the tubes and drop them in the slot."</p>

<p>Tom turned to see Astro stuffing his papers in the
thin cylinder disgustedly. Phil Morgan came up and
stood in back of Tom. His face was flushed.</p>

<p>"Everything O.K., Phil?" inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"Easy as free falling in space," replied the other
cadet, his soft Georgian drawl full of confidence. "How
about you?"</p>

<p>"I'm just hoping against hope."</p>

<p>The few remaining stragglers hurried up to the line.</p>

<p>"Think Astro'll make it?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Tom, "I saw him sweating
over there like a man facing death."</p>

<p>"I guess he is&mdash;in a way."</p>

<p>Astro took his place in line and shrugged his shoulders
when Tom leaned forward to give him a questioning
look.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Tom," urged Phil. Tom turned and
dropped his tube into the green-bordered slot and
waited. He stared straight at the wall in front of him,
hardly daring to breathe. Presently, the tube was returned
in the red slot. He took it, turned it over in his
hands and walked slowly back to his desk.</p>

<p>"You're washed out, cabbagehead!" Manning's whisper
followed him. "Let's see if you can take it without
bawling!"</p>

<p>Tom's face burned and he fought an impulse to answer
Manning with a stiff belt in the jaw. But he kept
walking, reached his desk and sat down.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Astro, the last to return to his desk, held the tube out
in front of him as if it were alive. The room was silent
as Dr. Dale rose from her desk.</p>

<p>"All right now, boys," she announced. "Inside the
tubes you will find colored slips of paper. Those of you
who have red slips will remain here. Those who find
green slips will return to their quarters. Blue will go
with Captain Strong, orange with Lieutenant Saminsky,
and purple with Warrant Officer McKenny. Now&mdash;please
open the tubes."</p>

<p>There was a tinkling of metal caps and then the
slight rustle of paper as each boy withdrew the contents
of the tube before him.</p>

<p>Tom took a deep breath and felt inside for the paper.
He held his breath and pulled it out. It was green.
He didn't know what it meant. He looked around. Phil
was signaling to him, holding up a blue slip. Tom's
heart skipped a beat. Whatever the colors meant, he
and Phil were apart. He quickly turned around and
caught Astro's eye. The big Venusian held up a green
slip. Tom's heart then nearly stopped beating. Phil,
who had breezed through with such confidence, held
a blue slip, and Astro, who hadn't even finished the
test, held up the same color that he had. It could only
mean one thing. Failure. He felt the tears welling in
his eyes, but had no strength left to fight them back.</p>

<p>He looked up, his eyes meeting the insolent stare of
Roger Manning who was half turned in his seat. Remembering
the caustic warning of the confident cadet,
Tom fought back the flood in his eyes and glared
back.</p>

<p>What would he tell his mother? And his father? And
Billy, his brother, five years younger than himself,
whom he had promised to bring a flask of water from
the Grand Canal on Mars. And his sister! Tom remembered
the shining pride in her eyes when she kissed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
him good-bye at the Stratoport as he left for Atom City.</p>

<p>From the front of the room, McKenny's rasping voice
jarred him back to the present.</p>

<p>"Cadets&mdash;staaaaaaaand <i>to</i>!"</p>

<p>There was a shuffle of feet as the boys rose as one.</p>

<p>"All the purple slips follow me," he roared and
turned toward the door. The cadets with purple slips
marched after him.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Saminsky stepped briskly to the front of
the room.</p>

<p>"Cadets with orange slips will please come with me,"
he said casually, and another group of cadets left the
room.</p>

<p>From the rear of the room Captain Strong snapped
out an order.</p>

<p>"Blue slips will come with me!"</p>

<p>He turned smartly and followed the last of Lieutenant
Saminsky's cadets out of the room.</p>

<p>Tom looked around. The room was nearly empty
now. He looked over at Astro and saw his big friend
slumped moodily over against his desk. Then, suddenly,
he noticed Roger Manning. The arrogant cadet was not
smiling any longer. He was staring straight ahead. Before
him on the desk, Tom could see a green slip. So he
had failed too, thought Tom grimly. It was poor solace
for the misery he felt.</p>

<p>Dr. Dale stepped forward again.</p>

<p>"Will the cadets holding green slips return to their
quarters. Those with red slips will remain in their
seats," she announced.</p>

<p>Tom found himself moving with difficulty. As he
walked through the door, Astro joined him. A look more
eloquent than words passed between them and they
made their way silently up the slidestairs back to their
quarters.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>Lying in his bunk, hands under his head, eyes staring
into space, Tom asked, "What happens now?"</p>

<p>Sprawled on his bunk, Astro didn't answer right
away. He merely gulped and swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," he finally stammered. "I just don't
know."</p>

<p>"What'll you do?"</p>

<p>"It's back to the hold of a Venusport freighter, I
guess. I don't know." Astro paused and looked at Tom.
"What'll you do?"</p>

<p>"Go home," said Tom simply. "Go home and&mdash;and
find a job."</p>

<p>"Ever think about the enlisted Solar Guard? Look at
McKenny&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know how you feel," sighed Astro. "Being in the
enlisted section&mdash;is like&mdash;well, being a passenger&mdash;almost."</p>

<p>The door was suddenly flung open.</p>

<p>"Haul off them bunks, you blasted Earthworms!"</p>

<p>McKenny stood in the doorway in his usual aggressive
pose, and Tom and Astro hit the floor together to
stand at attention.</p>

<p>"Where's the other cadet?"</p>

<p>"He went with Captain Strong, sir." answered Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Mike. And in a surprisingly soft tone he
added, "You two pulled green slips, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," they replied together.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know how you did it, but congratulations.
You passed the classification tests. Both of you."</p>

<p>Tom just looked at the scarlet-clad, stumpy warrant
officer. He couldn't believe his ears. Suddenly he felt
as if he had been lifted off his feet. And then he realized
that he <i>was</i> off his feet. Astro was holding him
over his head. Then he dumped him in his bunk as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
easily as if he had been a child. And at the same time,
the big Venusian let out a loud, long, earsplitting yell.</p>

<p>McKenny matched him with his bull-like roar.</p>

<p>"Plug that foghorn, you blasted Earthworm. You'll
have the whole Academy in here thinking there's a
murder."</p>

<p>By this time Tom was on his feet again, standing in
front of McKenny.</p>

<p>"You mean, we made it? We're really in? We're cadets?"</p>

<p>"That's right." McKenny looked at a clip board in his
hand and read, "Cadet Corbett, Tom. Qualified for control
deck. Cadet Astro. Power deck."</p>

<p>Astro took a deep breath and started another yell,
but before he could let go, McKenny clamped a big
hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>"You bellow like that again and I'll make meteor dust
out of you!"</p>

<p>Astro gulped and then matched Tom's grin with one
that spread from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"What happened to Philip Morgan?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"What color slip did he have?"</p>

<p>"Blue."</p>

<p>"Anything besides green washed out," replied Mike
quickly. "Now let's see, you have a replacement for
Morgan in this unit. An astrogator."</p>

<p>"Greetings, gentlemen," drawled a voice that Tom
recognized without even looking. "Allow me to introduce
myself to my new unit-mates. My name is Manning&mdash;Roger
Manning. But then, we're old friends,
aren't we?"</p>

<p>"Stow that rocket wash, Manning," snapped Mike.
He glanced at the clock over the door. "You have an
hour and forty-five minutes until lunch time. I suggest
you take a walk around the Academy and familiarize
yourselves with the arrangement of the buildings."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>And then, for the first time, Tom saw the hard little
spaceman smile.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you made it, boys. All three of you." He
paused and looked at each of them in turn. "And I can
honestly say I'm looking forward to the day when I
can serve under you!"</p>

<p>He snapped his back straight, gave the three startled
boys a crisp salute, executed a perfect about-face and
marched out of the room.</p>

<p>"And that," drawled Roger, strolling to the bunk
nearest the window, "is the corniest bit of space gas I've
ever heard."</p>

<p>"Listen, Manning!" growled Astro, spinning around
quickly to face him.</p>

<p>"Yeah," purred Roger, his eyes drawn to fine points,
hands hanging loosely at his sides. "What would you
like me to listen to, Cadet Astro?"</p>

<p>The hulking cadet lunged at Manning, but Tom
quickly stepped between them.</p>

<p>"Stow it, both of you!" he shouted. "We're in this
room together, so we might as well make the best of it."</p>

<p>"Of course, Corbett&mdash;of course," replied Manning
easily. He turned his back on Astro, who stood, feet
wide apart, neck muscles tight and hands clenched in
hamlike fists.</p>

<p>"One of these days I'll break you in two, Manning.
I'll close that fast-talking mouth of yours for good!"</p>

<p>Astro's voice was a low growl. Roger stood near the
window port and appeared to have forgotten the incident.</p>

<p>The light shining in from the hallway darkened, and
Tom turned to see three blue-clad senior cadets arranged
in a row just inside the door.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, gentlemen. You're now qualified
cadets of Space Academy," said a redheaded lad about
twenty-one. "My name is Al Dixon," he turned to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
left and right, "and these are cadets Bill Houseman and
Rodney Withrop."</p>

<p>"Hiya," replied Tom. "Glad to know you. I'm Tom
Corbett. This is Astro&mdash;and Roger Manning."</p>

<p>Astro shook hands, the three senior cadets giving
a long glance at the size of the hand he offered.
Roger came forward smartly and shook hands with a
smile.</p>

<p>"We're sorta like a committee," began Dixon. "We've
come to sign you up for the Academy sports program."</p>

<p>They made themselves comfortable in the room.</p>

<p>"You have a chance to take part in three sports. Free-fall
wrestling, mercuryball and space chess." Dixon
glanced at Houseman and Withrop. "From the looks of
Cadet Astro, free-fall wrestling should be child's play
for him!"</p>

<p>Astro merely grinned.</p>

<p>"Mercuryball is pretty much like the old game of
soccer," explained Houseman. "But inside the ball is a
smaller ball filled with mercury, making it take crazy
dips and turns. You have to be pretty fast even to
touch it."</p>

<p>"Sounds like you have to be a little Mercurian yourself,"
smiled Tom.</p>

<p>"You do," replied Dixon. "Oh, yes, you three play as
a unit. Competition starts in a few days. So if you've
never played before, you might go down to the gym
and start practicing."</p>

<p>"You mentioned space chess," asked Roger. "What's
that?"</p>

<p>"It's really nothing more than maneuvers. Space
maneuvers," said Dixon. "A glass case, a seven-foot
cube, is divided by light shafts into smaller cubes of
equal shape and size. Each man has a complete space
squadron. Three model rocket cruisers, six destroyers
and ten scouts. The ships are filled with gas to make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
them float, and your power is derived from magnetic
force. The problem is to get a combination of cruisers
and destroyers and scouts into a space section where it
could knock out your opponent's ships."</p>

<p>"You mean," interrupted Astro, "you've got to keep
track of all those ships at once?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Astro," commented Roger quickly.
"You use your muscles to win for dear old 42-D in free-fall
wrestling. Corbett here can pound down the grassy
field for a goal in mercuryball, and I'll do the brainwork
of space chess."</p>

<p>The three visiting cadets exchanged sharp glances.</p>

<p>"Everybody plays together, Manning," said Dixon.
"You three take part in each sport as a unit."</p>

<p>"Of course," nodded Roger. "Of course&mdash;as a unit."</p>

<p>The three cadets stood up, shook hands all around
and left. Tom immediately turned to Manning.</p>

<p>"What was the idea of that crack about brains?"</p>

<p>Manning slouched over to the window port and said
over his shoulder, "I don't know how you and your
king-sized friend here passed the classifications test,
Corbett, and I don't care. But, as you say, we're a unit.
So we might as well make adjustments."</p>

<p>He turned to face them with a cold stare.</p>

<p>"I know this Academy like the palm of my hand," he
went on. "Never mind how, just take it for granted. <i>I
know it.</i> I'm here for the ride. For a special reason I
wouldn't care to have you know. I'll get my training
and then pull out."</p>

<p>He took a step forward, his face a mask of bitterness.</p>

<p>"So from now on, you two guys leave me alone. You
bore me to death with your emotional childish allegiance
to this&mdash;this"&mdash;he paused and spit the last out
cynically&mdash;"space kindergarten!"

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3" id="CHAPTER_3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>


<p>"I just can't understand it, Joan," said Captain Steve
Strong, tossing the paper on his circular desk. "The
psychographs of Corbett, Manning and Astro fit together
like gears. And yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Solar Guard officer suddenly rose and walked
over to a huge window that filled the entire north wall
of his office, a solid sheet of glass that extended from
the high domed ceiling to the translucent flooring.
Through the window, he stared down moodily toward
the grassy quadrangle, where at the moment several
hundred cadets were marching in formation under a
hot sun.</p>

<p>"&mdash;And yet," continued Strong, "every morning for
the last three weeks I've got a report from McKenny
about some sort of friction between them!"</p>

<p>"I think it'll work out, Steve," answered the pretty
girl in the uniform of the Solar Guard, seated in an
easy chair on the other side of the desk.</p>

<p>Joan Dale held the distinction of being the first
woman ever admitted into the Solar Guard, in a capacity
other than administrative work. Her experiments in
atomic fissionables was the subject of a recent scientific
symposium held on Mars. Over fifty of the leading
scientists of the Solar Alliance had gathered to study
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
her latest theory on hyperdrive, and had unanimously
declared her ideas valid. She had been offered the chair
as Master of Physics at the Academy as a result, giving
her access to the finest laboratory in the tri-planet society.</p>

<p>Now facing the problem of personality adjustment in
Unit 42-D, she sat across the desk from her childhood
friend, Steve Strong, and frowned.</p>

<p>"What's happened this time?"</p>

<p>"Manning." He paused. "It seems to be all Manning!"</p>

<p>"You mean he's the more aggressive of the three?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not necessarily. Corbett shows signs of being
a number-one spaceman. And that big cadet, Astro"&mdash;Strong
flashed a white smile that contrasted with his
deep space tan&mdash;"I don't think he could make a manual
mistake on the power deck if he tried. You know, I
actually saw him put an auxiliary rocket motor together
blindfolded!"</p>

<p>The pretty scientist smiled. "I could have told you
that after one look at his classification tests."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"On questions concerning the power-deck operations,
he was letter perfect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And on the others? Astrogation and control deck?"</p>

<p>"He just skimmed by. But even where the problem
involved fuel, power, supply of energy, he offered some
very practical answer to the problem." She smiled.
"Astro is as much an artist on that power deck as Liddy
Tamal doing Juliet in the stereos."</p>

<p>"Yes," mused Strong. "And Corbett is the same on
the control deck. Good instinctive intelligence. That
boy soaks up knowledge like a sponge."</p>

<p>"Facile mind&mdash;quick to grasp the essentials." She
smiled again. "Seems to me I remember a few years
back when a young lieutenant successfully put down a
mutiny in space, and at his promotion to captain, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
citation included the fact that he was quick to grasp
the essentials."</p>

<p>Strong grinned sheepishly. A routine flight to Titan
had misfired into open rebellion by the crew. Using a
trick picked up in ancient history books of sea-roving
pirates in the seventeenth century, he had joined the
mutiny, gained control of the ship, sought out the ring-leaders
and restored discipline.</p>

<p>"And Manning," asked Strong. "What about Manning?"</p>

<p>"One of the hardest, brightest minds I've come across
in the Academy. He has a brain like a steel trap. He
never misses."</p>

<p>"Then, do you think he's acting up because Corbett
is the nominal head of the unit? Does he feel that he
should be the command cadet in the control deck instead
of Corbett?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Dr. Dale. "Not at all. I'm sure he
intentionally missed problems about control deck and
command in his classification test. He concentrated
on astrogation, communications and signal radar. He
wanted to be assigned to the radar deck. And he turned
in the best paper I've ever read from a cadet to get the
post."</p>

<p>Strong threw up his hands. "Then what is it? Here
we have a unit, on paper at least, that could be number
one. A good combination of brains, experience and
knowledge. Everything that's needed. And what is the
result? Friction!"</p>

<p>Suddenly a buzzer sounded, and on Steve Strong's
desk a small teleceiver screen glowed into life. Gradually
the stern face of Commander Walters emerged.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disturb you, Steve. Can you spare me a
minute?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Commander," replied Strong. "Is anything
wrong?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>"Very wrong, Steve. I've been looking over the
daily performance reports on Unit 42-D."</p>

<p>"Dr. Dale and I have just been discussing that situation,
sir." A relieved expression passed over the commander's
face.</p>

<p>"Good! I wanted to get your opinions before I broke
up the unit."</p>

<p>"No, sir!" said Strong quickly. "Don't do that!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" replied the commander. On the screen he
could be seen settling back in his chair.</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, Joan&mdash;er&mdash;Dr. Dale and myself feel that the
boys of Unit 42-D make it potentially the best in
the Academy&mdash;if they stay together, sir."</p>

<p>Walters considered this for a moment and then asked
thoughtfully, "Give me one good reason why the unit
shouldn't be washed out."</p>

<p>"The academy needs boys like this, sir," Steve answered
flatly. "Needs their intelligence, their experience.
They may be a problem now, but if they're handled
right, they'll turn out to be ace spacemen,
they'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>The commander interrupted. "You're pretty sold on
them, aren't you, Steve?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am."</p>

<p>"You know, tomorrow all the units will be assigned
to their personal instructors."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And I've selected Lieutenant Wolcheck for
this unit. He's tough and smart. I think he's just the
man for the job."</p>

<p>"I don't agree, Steve. Wolcheck is a fine officer and
with any other unit there'd be no question. But I think
we have a better man for the job."</p>

<p>"Whom do you suggest, sir?"</p>

<p>The commander leaned forward in his chair.</p>

<p>"You, Steve."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"What do you think, Joan?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to make the same suggestion, Commander,"
smiled Joan. "But I didn't know if Steve really
would want the assignment."</p>

<p>"Well, what about it, Steve?" asked the commander.
"This is no reflection on your present work. But if you're
so convinced that 42-D is worth the trouble, then take
them over and mold them into spacemen. Otherwise, I'll
have to wash them out."</p>

<p>Strong hesitated a moment. "All right, sir. I'll do my
best."</p>

<p>On the screen the stern lines in Commander Walters'
face relaxed and he smiled approvingly.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Steve," he said softly. "I was hoping you'd
say that. Keep me posted."</p>

<p>The screen blacked out abruptly and Captain Strong
turned to Joan Dale, a troubled frown wrinkling his
brow.</p>

<p>"Huh. I really walked into that one, didn't I?" he
muttered.</p>

<p>"It isn't going to be easy, Steve," she replied.</p>

<p>"Easy!" He snorted and walked over to the window
to stare blankly at the quadrangle below. "I'd almost
rather try a landing on the hot side of Mercury. It
would be icy compared to this situation!"</p>

<p>"You can do it, Steve. I know you can." Joan moved
to his side to place a reassuring hand on his arm.</p>

<p>The Solar Guard officer didn't answer immediately.
He kept on staring at the Academy grounds and buildings
spread out before him. When he finally spoke, his
voice rang with determination.</p>

<p>"I've got to do it, Joan. I've got to whip those boys
into a unit. Not only for their sakes&mdash;but for the sake of
the Academy!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4" id="CHAPTER_4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>


<p>The first three weeks of an Earthworm's life at Space
Academy are filled with never-ending physical training
and conditioning to meet the rigors of rocket flight
and life on distant planets. And under the grueling
pressure of fourteen-hour days, filled with backbreaking
exercises and long forced marches, very few of the
boys can find anything more desirable than sleep&mdash;and
more sleep.</p>

<p>Under this pressure the friction in Unit 42-D became
greater and greater. Roger and Astro continually needled
each other with insults, and Tom gradually
slipped into the role of arbiter.</p>

<p>Returning from a difficult afternoon of endless
marching in the hot sun with the prospect of an evening
of free-fall wrestling before them, the three cadets
dragged themselves wearily onto the slidestairs leading
to their quarters, their muscles screaming for rest.</p>

<p>"Another day like this," began Astro listlessly, "and
I'm going to melt down to nothing. Doesn't McKenny
have a heart?"</p>

<p>"No, just an asteroid," Tom grumbled. "He'll never
know how close he came to getting a space boot in the
face when he woke us up this morning. Oh, man! Was
I tired!"</p>

<p>"Stop complaining, will you?" snarled Roger. "All
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
I've heard from you two space crawlers is gripes and
complaints."</p>

<p>"If I wasn't so tired, Roger," said Astro, "I'd give you
something to gripe about. A flat lip!"</p>

<p>"Knock it off, Astro," said Tom wearily. The role of
keeping them apart was getting tiresome.</p>

<p>"The trouble with you, Astro," pursued Roger, "is
that you think with your muscles instead of your head."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know. And you've got an electronic calculator
for a brain. All you have to do is push a button
and you get the answers all laid out for you."</p>

<p>They had reached their quarters now and were stripping
off their sweat-soaked uniforms in preparation for
a cool shower.</p>

<p>"You know, Roger," continued Astro, "you've got a
real problem ahead of you."</p>

<p>"Any problem you think I have is no problem at all,"
was the cool reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," insisted Astro. "When you're ready for
your first hop in space, you won't be able to make it!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"They don't have a space helmet in the Academy
large enough to fit that overinflated head of yours!"</p>

<p>Roger turned slowly and spoke to Tom without looking
at him. "Close the door, Corbett!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Tom, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Because I don't want any interruptions. I'm going to
take that big hunk of Venusian space junk apart."</p>

<p>"Anything you say, you bigmouthed squirt!" roared
Astro.</p>

<p>"Hey&mdash;knock it off!" yelled Tom, jumping between
them and grabbing Astro's arm. "If you guys don't lay
off each other, you're going to be thrown out of the
Academy, and I'll be thrown out with you! I'll be
blasted if I'll suffer for your mistakes!"</p>

<p>"That's a very interesting statement, Corbett!" A deep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
voice purred from the doorway and the three boys
whirled to see Captain Strong walk into the room,
his black and gold uniform fitting snugly across the
shoulders betraying their latent strength. "Stand to&mdash;all
of you!"</p>

<p>As the boys quickly snapped to attention, Strong
eyed them slowly and then moved casually around the
room. He picked up a book, looked out of the window
port, pushed a boot to one side and, finally, removed
Tom's sweat-stained uniform from a chair and sat
down. The cadets held their rigid poses, backs stiff,
eyes looking straight ahead.</p>

<p>"Corbett?" snapped Strong.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"What was the meaning of that little speech I heard
a moment ago?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;don't quite understand what you mean, sir,"
stumbled Tom.</p>

<p>"I think you do," said Strong. "I want to know what
provoked you to make such a statement."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not answer that, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't get cute, Corbett!" barked Strong. "I know
what's going on in this unit. Were Manning and Astro
squaring off to fight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom slowly.</p>

<p>"All right. At ease all of you," said Strong. The three
boys relaxed and faced the officer.</p>

<p>"Manning, do you want to be a successful cadet here
at Space Academy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Roger.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you act like it?" asked Strong.</p>

<p>"Is there something wrong with my work, sir?" Tom
recognized the smooth Manning confidence begin to
appear, and he wondered if Captain Strong would be
taken in.</p>

<p>"Everything's wrong with your work," barked Strong.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
"You're too smart! Know too much!" He stopped short
and then added softly with biting sarcasm, "Why do
you know so much, Cadet Manning?"</p>

<p>Roger hesitated. "I've studied very hard. Studied for
years to become a Space Cadet," he replied.</p>

<p>"Just to be a cadet or a successful cadet <i>and</i> a Solar
Guard officer?"</p>

<p>"To be successful at both, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Manning, do you have any ideas on life?"</p>

<p>"That's a pretty general question, sir. Do you mean
life as a whole or a specific part of life?" They're fencing
with each other, thought Tom. He held his breath
as Strong eyed the relaxed, confident cadet.</p>

<p>"A spaceman is supposed to have but one idea in life,
Manning. And that idea is <i>space</i>!"</p>

<p>"I see, sir," replied Roger, as a faraway look came
into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have some ideas about life in space."</p>

<p>"I'd like to hear them!" requested Strong coldly.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir." Roger relaxed his shoulders and
leaned against the bunk. "I believe space is the last
frontier of man&mdash;Earthman. It's the last place for man to
conquer. It is the greatest adventure of all time and I
want to be a part of that adventure."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Manning." Strong's voice was even
colder than before. "But as it happens, I can read too.
That was a direct quote from the closing paragraph of
Jon Builker's book on his trip to the stars!" He paused.
"Couldn't you think of anything original to say?"</p>

<p>Roger flushed and gritted his teeth. Tom could
hardly keep himself from laughing. Captain Strong had
scored heavily!</p>

<p>The Solar Guard officer then turned his attention to
Astro.</p>

<p>"Astro, where in the name of the universe did you get
the idea you could be an officer in the Solar Guard?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>"I can handle anything with push in it, sir!" Astro
smiled his confidence.</p>

<p>"Know anything about hyperdrive?"</p>

<p>"Uhh&mdash;no, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you can't handle everything with, as you say,
push in it!" snapped Strong.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;no, sir," answered Astro, his face clouding over.</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence while Strong
lifted one knee, swung it over the arm of his chair, and
looked steadily at the two half-naked boys in front of
him. He smiled lazily.</p>

<p>"Well, for two Earthworms, you've certainly been
acting like a couple of space aces!"</p>

<p>He let that soak in while he toyed with the gleaming
Academy ring on his finger. He allowed it to flash in
the light of the window port, then slipped it off and
flipped it over to Corbett.</p>

<p>"Know what that is?" he asked the curly-haired cadet.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom. "Your Academy graduation
ring."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. Now give it to our friend from Venus."
Tom gingerly handed Astro the ring.</p>

<p>"Try it on, Astro," invited Strong.</p>

<p>The big cadet tried it on all of his fingers but couldn't
get it past the first joint.</p>

<p>"Give it to Manning."</p>

<p>Roger accepted the ring and held it in the palm of
his hand. He looked at it with a hard stare, then
dropped it in the outstretched hand of the Solar Guard
officer. Replacing it on his finger, Strong spoke casually.</p>

<p>"All units design their own rings. There are only
three like this in the universe. One is drifting around
in space on the finger of Sam Jones. Another is blasting
a trail to the stars on the finger of Addy Garcia."
He held up his finger. "This is the third one."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>Strong got up and began to pace in front of the boys.</p>

<p>"Addy Garcia couldn't speak a word of English
when he first came to the Academy. And for eight
weeks Sam and I sweated to figure out what he was
talking about. I think we spent over a hundred hours
in the galley doing KP because Addy kept getting us
fouled up. But that didn't bother us because we were
a unit. Unit 33-V. Class of 2338."</p>

<p>Strong turned to face the silent cadets.</p>

<p>"Sam Jones was pretty much like you, Astro. Not as
big, but with the same love for that power deck. He
could always squeeze a few extra pounds of thrust out
of those rockets. What he knew about astrogation and
control, you could stick on the head of a pin. On long
flights he wouldn't even come up to the control deck.
He just sat in the power hole singing loud corny songs
about the Arkansas mountains to those atomic motors.
He was a real power-deck man. But he was a <i>unit</i> man
first! The only reason I'm here to tell you about it is
because he never forgot the unit. He died saving Addy
and myself."</p>

<p>The room was still. Down the long hall, the lively
chatter of other cadets could be heard as they
showered and prepared for dinner. In the distance, the
rumble of the slidewalks and test firing of rockets at
the spaceport was dim, subdued, powerful.</p>

<p>"The unit is the backbone of the Academy," continued
Strong. "It was set up to develop three men to handle
a Solar Guard rocket cruiser. Three men who could
be taught to think, feel and act as one intelligent brain.
Three men who would respect each other and who
could depend on each other. Tomorrow you begin your
real education. You will be supervised and instructed
personally.</p>

<p>"Many men have contributed to the knowledge that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
will be placed in front of you&mdash;brave, intelligent men,
who blasted through the atmosphere with a piece of
metal under them for a spaceship and a fire in their
tail for rockets. But everything they accomplished goes
to waste if the unit can't become a single personality.
It must be a single personality, or it doesn't exist. The
unit is the ultimate of hundreds of years of research
and progress. But you have to fight to create it and
keep it living. Either you want it, or you get out of the
Academy!"</p>

<p>Captain Strong turned away momentarily and Tom
and Astro looked at Roger significantly.</p>

<p>"Stand to!"</p>

<p>The three boys snapped to attention as the wide-shouldered
captain addressed them again.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow you begin to learn how to think as a
single brain. To act with combined intelligence as
one person. You either make up your minds to start
tomorrow or you report to Commander Walters and
resign. There isn't any room here for individuals."</p>

<p>He stepped to the door and paused.</p>

<p>"One more thing. I've been given the job of making
you over into spacemen. I'm your unit commander. If
you're still here in the morning, I'll accept that as your
answer. If you think you can't take"&mdash;he paused&mdash;"what
I'm going to dish out, then you know what you
can do. And if you stay, you'll <i>be</i> the best unit, or
I'll break you in two in the attempt. Unit dis ...
missed!" And he was gone.</p>

<p>The three cadets stood still, not knowing quite what
to do or say. Finally Tom stepped before Astro and
Roger.</p>

<p>"Well," he said quietly, "how about it, you guys? Are
you going to lay off each other now?"</p>

<p>Astro flushed, but Roger eyed Corbett coolly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>"Were you really taken in with that space gas, Tom?"
He turned to the shower room. "If you were, then
you're more childish than I thought."</p>

<p>"A man died to save another man's life, Roger. Sam
Jones. I never knew him. But I've met Captain Strong,
and I believe that he would have done the same thing
for Jones."</p>

<p>"Very noble," commented Roger from the doorway.</p>

<p>"But I'll tell you this, Manning," said Tom, following
him, fighting for self-control, "I wouldn't want to have
to depend on you to save my life. And I wouldn't want
to be faced with the situation where I would have to
sacrifice mine to save yours!"</p>

<p>Roger turned and glared at Tom.</p>

<p>"The Academy regs say that the man on the control
deck is the boss of the unit. But I have my private opinion
of the man who has that job now!"</p>

<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Just this, spaceboy. There's a gym below where I'll
take you <i>or</i> your big friend on&mdash;together&mdash;or one at a
time." He paused, a cold smile twisting his lips. "And
that offer is good as of right now!"</p>

<p>Tom and Astro looked at each other.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," began Astro slowly, "that you wouldn't
stand much of a chance with me, Manning. So if Tom
wants the chore of buttoning your lip, he's welcome
to it."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Astro," said Tom evenly. "It'll be my pleasure."</p>

<p>Without another word, the three cadets walked out
of the door.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_5" id="CHAPTER_5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>


<p>"Will this do, Manning?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>The three boys were in a secluded corner of the gym,
a large hall on the fourteenth floor of the dormitory
building. At the far end of the gym, a group of cadets
had just finished a game of mercuryball and were sauntering
to the showers. When the last boy had disappeared,
the floor was deserted except for Tom, Roger
and Astro.</p>

<p>"This will do fine, Corbett," said Roger.</p>

<p>The boxing ring had been taken down the week before
to make room for drills and the physical exercises
of the Earthworms, so the three boys had to improvise
a ring. They dragged four large tumbling mats together,
spreading them side by side to form a square
close to the size of an actual ring. Astro went to one of
the small lockers under the balcony and returned with
two pairs of boxing gloves.</p>

<p>"Here," offered Astro, "put these on."</p>

<p>"Gloves?" asked Roger, in a voice of mock surprise.
"I thought this was going to be a battle of blood."</p>

<p>"Any way you want it, Manning. Any way at all," said
Tom.</p>

<p>"You're going to use gloves," growled Astro. "I don't
want anybody killed." He threw a pair at each of them.</p>

<p>"There'll be three-minute rounds, with one minute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
rest," he continued. "Go off the mats and you'll be
counted out. Usual rules otherwise. Any questions?"</p>

<p>"Clear to me, Astro," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Let's go," nodded Roger.</p>

<p>"One more thing," said Astro. "I hope Tom pins your
ears back, Manning. But I'm going to see that both of
you get a fair deal. So keep the punches up&mdash;and fight
it out. All right&mdash;time!"</p>

<p>The two boys moved carefully to the center of the
improvised ring, their guards up, while Astro stood off
the edge of the mat and watched the sweeping second
hand of his wrist chronograph.</p>

<p>Shuffling forward Tom pushed out a probing left and
then tried to cross his right, but Manning stepped back
easily, countering with a hard left to Tom's heart.</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you, Corbett," he called out, "I'm
considered a counterpuncher. I always&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was cut off with a sharp left to the face that
snapped his head back, and his lips curled in a smile
of condescension.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;very good, Corbett."</p>

<p>Then with lightning speed and the grace of a cat,
Roger slipped inside Tom's guard, punching hard and
true. A left, a right and a left pounded into Tom's mid-section,
and as he gave way momentarily Tom's face
clouded over.</p>

<p>They circled. Tom kept leading with sharp lefts that
popped in and out like a piston, always connecting and
keeping Roger off balance. Roger concentrated on penetrating
Tom's defense, methodically pounding his ribs
and heart and trying to wear him down.</p>

<p>"Time!" bawled Astro.</p>

<p>The two boys dropped their hands and turned back
to their corners. They squatted on the floor breathing
slowly and easily. Astro stood in the middle of the ring,
glaring at both of them in turn and shaking his head.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>"Huh. I expected to see you two try to wallop each
other into meteor dust! Keep fighting like that and we'll
be here all night!"</p>

<p>"Talk to Corbett," sneered Roger. "Looks like he's
afraid to mix it up!"</p>

<p>"You fight your way, Roger, and I'll fight mine," replied
Tom, his voice cold and impersonal.</p>

<p>"Time!" suddenly yelled Astro and stepped back off
the mat.</p>

<p>The two cadets jumped to their feet and met in the
center of the ring again. With a bull-like rush, Roger
changed tactics and began to rain punches all over
Tom's body, but the curly-haired cadet stood his
ground coolly, picking some off in mid-air with his
gloves and sliding under the others. Then, as Roger
slowed down, Tom took the offensive, popping his left
into his opponent's face steadily and methodically,
while keeping his right cocked for a clear opening to
the chin.</p>

<p>Roger danced in and out, watching Tom's left as
though it was a snake and trying unsuccessfully to get
through his guard. But the sharp lefts kept snapping his
head back and his face began to redden, not only from
the sting of the blows but with the mounting fury of his
frustration.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as Astro raised his arm to call time for the
end of the round, Roger jumped forward and rained
another series of harmless blows on Tom's shoulders
and arms. But then, as the big Venusian called time,
he stepped back and Tom dropped his guard. Instantly,
Roger threw a right with all his weight behind it. It
landed flush on Tom's jaw and he dropped, sprawling
full length on the mats and lying still.</p>

<p>Smiling, Roger sauntered to his corner while Astro
charged in and bent over the fallen cadet.</p>

<p>"None of that, Astro!" snapped Roger. "Since when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
does a referee take sides? Leave him alone! If he
doesn't come out for the next round, you have to count
him out!"</p>

<p>The big Venusian straightened and walked menacingly
toward Roger's corner. "You hit him after I called
time," he growled.</p>

<p>"So I have to take you on too, huh?" Roger jumped
to his feet. "All right&mdash;come on, you big blast of space
gas!"</p>

<p>"Wait, Astro ... wait!"</p>

<p>Astro suddenly wheeled around to see Tom shaking
his head weakly and trying to rise up on his elbows.
He rushed back to the fallen boy's side.</p>

<p>Roger shouted at him angrily, "Leave him alone!"</p>

<p>"Ahhh&mdash;go blow your jets!" was Astro's snarling
reply as he bent over Tom, who was now sitting up.
"Tom, are you O.K.?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;yeah," he replied weakly. "But stay out of
this. You're the referee. How much time left?"</p>

<p>"Twenty seconds," said Astro. "Roger smacked you
after I called time."</p>

<p>"If he did, I didn't know a thing about it. I was out."
Tom managed a cold smile. "Nice punch, Roger."</p>

<p>"Ten seconds," said Astro, stepping back off the mat.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the compliment, Corbett." Roger eyed
the other cadet speculatively. "But are you sure you
want to go on?"</p>

<p>"I was saved by the bell, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;sure&mdash;but if you'd rather quit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Time!" cried Astro.</p>

<p>Tom rose to his feet&mdash;shook his head&mdash;and brought
up his hands. He wasn't a moment too soon. Roger had
rushed across the mat, trying to land another murderous
right. Tom brought up his shoulder just in time,
slipping with the punch, and at the same time, bringing
up a terrific left to Roger's open mid-section. Manning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
let out a grunt and clinched. Tom pursued his advantage,
pumping rights and lefts to the body, and he
could feel the arrogant cadet weakening. Suddenly,
Roger crowded in close, wrestling Tom around so that
Astro was on the opposite side of the mat, then brought
up his head under Tom's chin. The pop of Tom's teeth
could be heard all over the great hall. Roger quickly
stepped back, and back-pedaled until Astro called time.</p>

<p>"Thanks for teaching me that one, Roger. Learned
two tricks from you today," said Tom, breathing heavily,
but with the same cold smile on his face.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Corbett. Any time," said Manning.</p>

<p>"What tricks?" asked Astro. He looked suspiciously
at Manning, who was doubled over, finding it hard to
breath.</p>

<p>"Nothing I can't handle in time," said Tom, looking at
Roger.</p>

<p>"Time!" called Astro and stepped off the mat.</p>

<p>The two boys got to their feet slowly. The pace was
beginning to show on them and they boxed carefully.</p>

<p>The boys were perfectly matched, Tom constantly
snapping Roger's head back with the jolting left jabs
and following to the head or heart with a right cross.
And Roger counterpunching, slipping hooks and body
punches in under Tom's long leads. It was a savage
fight. The three weeks of hard physical training had
conditioned the boys perfectly.</p>

<p>At the end of the twelfth round, both boys showed
many signs of wear. Roger's cheeks were as red as the
glow of a jet blast deflector from the hundreds of lefts
Tom had pumped into his face, while Tom's ribs and
mid-section were bruised and raw where Roger's
punches had landed successfully.</p>

<p>It couldn't last much longer, thought Astro, as he
called time for the beginning of the thirteenth round.</p>

<p>Roger quickened his pace, dancing in and out, trying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>to move in under Tom's lefts, but suddenly Tom
caught him with a right hand that was cocked and
ready. It staggered him and he fell back, covering up.
Tom pressed his advantage, showering rights and lefts
everywhere he could find an opening. In desperation,
his knees buckling, Roger clinched tightly, quickly
brought up his open glove and gouged his thumb into
Tom's eyes. Tom pulled back, instinctively pawing at
his eye with his right glove. Roger, spotting the opening,
took immediate advantage of it, shooting a hard
looping right that landed flush on Tom's jaw. Tom went
down.</p>

<p>Unaware of Roger's tactics, Astro jumped into the
ring and his arm pumped the deadly count.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was going to be tough if Roger won, Astro thought,
as he counted.</p>

<p>"Five&mdash;six&mdash;"</p>

<p>Arrogant enough now, he would be impossible to live
with.</p>

<p>"Seven&mdash;eight&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom struggled up to a sitting position and stared angrily
at his opponent in the far corner.</p>

<p>"Nine&mdash;"</p>

<p>With one convulsive effort, Tom regained his feet.
His left eye was closed and swollen, his right bleary
with fatigue. He wobbled drunkenly on his feet. But
he pressed forward. This was one fight he had to win.</p>

<p>Roger moved in for the finish. He slammed a left
into Tom's shell, trying to find an opening for the last
finishing blow. But Tom remained in his shell, forearms
picking off the smashes that even hurt his arms, as he
waited for the strength to return to his legs and arms
and his head to clear. He knew that he couldn't go another
round. He wouldn't be able to see. It would have
to be this round, and he had to <i>beat</i> Roger. <i>Not</i> because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>he wanted to, but because Roger was a member
of the unit. And he had to keep the unit together.</p>

<p>He circled his unit-mate with care, shielding himself
from the shower of rights and lefts that rained around
him. He waited&mdash;waited for the one perfect opening.</p>

<p>"Come on! Open up and fight, Corbett," panted
Roger.</p>

<p>Tom snapped his right in reply. He noticed that
Roger moved in with a hook every time he tried to
cross his right. He waited&mdash;his legs began to shake.
Roger circled and Tom shot out the left again, dropped
into a semicrouch and feinted with the right cross.
Roger moved in, cocking his fist for the left hook and
Tom was ready for him. He threw the right, threw it
with every ounce of strength left in his body. Roger
was caught moving in and took the blow flush on the
chin. He stopped as if poleaxed. His eyes turned glassy
and then he dropped to the mat. He was out cold.</p>

<p>Astro didn't even bother to count.</p>

<p>Tom squatted on the mat beside Roger and rubbed
the blond head with his glove.</p>

<p>"Get some water, Astro," he said, gasping for breath.
"I'm glad I don't have to fight this guy again. And I'll
tell you something else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Anybody that wants to win as much as this guy
does, is going to win, and I want to have him on my
side!"</p>

<p>Astro merely grunted as he turned toward the water
cooler.</p>

<p>"Maybe," he called back. "But he ought to read a
book of rules first!"</p>

<p>When he came back to the mat with the water, Roger
was sitting up, biting the knots of the laces on his
gloves. Tom helped him, and when the soggy leather
was finally discarded, he stuck out his hand. "Well,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Roger, I'm ready to forget everything we've said and
start all over again."</p>

<p>Roger looked at the extended hand for a moment, his
eyes blank and expressionless. Then, with a quick
movement, he slapped it away and lurched to his feet.</p>

<p>"Go blow your jets," he snarled, and turning his back
on them, stumbled across the gym.</p>

<p>Tom watched him go, bewilderment and pain mirrored
on his face.</p>

<p>"I thought sure this would work, Astro," he sighed.
"I thought he'd come to his senses if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing'll make that space creep come to his senses,"
Astro broke in disgustedly. "At least, nothing short
of an atomic war head! Come on. Let's get you
cleaned up!"</p>

<p>Putting his arm around Tom's shoulder, the big Venusian
led him across the floor of the deserted gym, and
as they disappeared through the automatic sliding
doors, a tall figure in the uniform of the Solar Guard
stepped out of the shadows on the balcony above. It
was Captain Strong.</p>

<p>He stood silently at the rail, looking down at the
mats and the soggy discarded boxing gloves. Tom had
won the fight, he thought, but he had lost the war. The
unit was now farther apart than it had ever been.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_6" id="CHAPTER_6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p>"Well, Steve, how's everything going?"</p>

<p>Captain Steve Strong didn't answer right away. He
returned the salute of a Space Cadet passing on the opposite
slidewalk and then faced Commander Walters
who stood beside him, eyeing him quizzically.</p>

<p>"Things are shaping up pretty well, Commander," he
replied, finally, with an air of unconcern.</p>

<p>"The Earthworm units buckling down to business?"
Commander Walters' voice matched Strong's in nonchalance.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd say so, sir. Speaking generally, of course."
Strong felt the back of his neck begin to flush as Walters
kept eyeing him.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;speaking specifically, Steve?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;ah&mdash;what do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"Let's stop fencing with each other, Steve." Walters
spoke kindly but firmly. "What about Manning and
Unit 42-D? Are those boys learning to work together
or not? And I want facts, not hopes!"</p>

<p>Strong hesitated, trying to word his reply. In these
weeks that had followed Tom's fight with Roger in the
gym, there had been no further incidents of open warfare.
Roger's attitude, once openly defiant, had now
subsided into a stream of never-ending sarcasm. The
sting had been taken out of his attack and he seemed
satisfied merely to annoy. Astro had withdrawn into a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>shell, refusing to allow Roger to bother him and only
an occasional rumble of anger indicated his true feelings
toward his troublesome unit-mate. Tom maintained
his role of peacemaker and daily, in many ways,
showed his capacity for leadership by steering his unit-mates
away from any storm-provoking activities.</p>

<p>Strong finally broke the silence. "It's difficult to answer
that question with facts, Commander Walters."</p>

<p>"Why?" insisted Walters.</p>

<p>"Well, nothing's really happened," answered Steve.</p>

<p>"You mean, nothing since the fight in the gym?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" Strong flushed. "You know about that?"</p>

<p>Commander Walters smiled. "Black eyes and faces
that looked like raw beef don't go unnoticed, Steve."</p>

<p>"Uhh&mdash;no, sir," was Strong's lame reply.</p>

<p>"What I want to know is," pursued Walters, "did the
fight prove anything? Did the boys get it out of their
systems and are they concentrating on becoming a
unit?"</p>

<p>"Right now, Commander, they're concentrating on
passing their manuals. They realize that they have to
work together to get through this series of tests. Why,
Dr. Dale told me the other day that she's sure Tom's
been giving Roger a few pointers on control-deck operation.
And one night I found Manning giving Astro a
lecture in compression ratios. Of course, Manning's way
of talking is a way that would confuse the Venusian
more than it would help him, but at least they weren't
snarling at each other."</p>

<p>"Hmm," Walters nodded. "Sounds hopeful, but still
not conclusive. After all, they have to help each other
in the manuals. If one member of the unit fails, it will
reflect on the marks of the other two and they might
be washed out too. Even the deadliest enemies will
unite to save their lives."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, sir," replied Strong. "But we're not dealing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>with deadly enemies now. These are three boys, with
three distinct personalities who've been lumped together
in strange surroundings. It takes time and patience
to make a team that will last for years."</p>

<p>"You may have the patience, Steve, but the Academy
hasn't the time." Commander Walters was suddenly
curt. "When does Unit 42-D take its manuals?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon, sir," replied Strong. "I'm on my way
over to the examination hall right now."</p>

<p>"Very well. I won't take any action yet. I'll wait for
the results of the tests. Perhaps they will solve both our
problems. See you later, Steve." Turning abruptly,
Commander Walters stepped off the slidewalk onto the
steps of the Administration Building and rapidly disappeared
from view.</p>

<p>Left alone, Strong pondered the commander's parting
statement. The implication was clear. If the unit
failed to make a grade high enough to warrant the
trouble it took keeping it together, it would be broken
up. Or even worse, one or more of the boys would be
dismissed from the Academy.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Strong arrived in the examination
hall, a large, barren room with a small door in
each of the three walls other than the one containing
the entrance. Tom Corbett was waiting in the center of
the hall and saluted smartly as Strong approached.</p>

<p>"Cadet Corbett reporting for manual examination,
sir!"</p>

<p>"Stand easy, Corbett," replied Strong, returning the
salute. "This is going to be a rough one. Are you fully
prepared?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, sir." Tom's voice wasn't too steady.</p>

<p>A fleeting smile passed over Strong's lips, then he
continued. "You'll take the control-deck examination
first. Manning will be next on the radar bridge and
Astro last on the power deck."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>"They'll be here according to schedule, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. Follow me."</p>

<p>Strong walked quickly to the small door in the left
wall, Tom staying a respectful step behind. When they
reached the door, the officer pressed a button in the
wall beside it and the door slid open.</p>

<p>"All right, Corbett. Inside." Strong nodded toward
the interior of the room.</p>

<p>The boy stepped in quickly, then stopped in amazement.
All around him was a maze of instruments and
controls. And in the center, twin pilot's chairs.</p>

<p>"Captain Strong!" Tom was so surprised that he
could hardly get the words out. "It's&mdash;it's a real control
deck!"</p>

<p>Strong smiled. "As real as we can make it, Corbett,
without allowing the building to blast off." He gestured
toward the pilot's chairs. "Take your place and
strap in."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." His eyes still wide with wonder, Tom
stepped over to the indicated chair and Strong followed
him, leaning casually against the other.</p>

<p>He watched the young cadet nervously adjust his
seat strap and put a comforting hand on his shoulder.
"Nervous, Corbett?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;just a little," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said Strong. "You should have seen
the way I came into this room fifteen years ago. My
cadet officer had to help me into the control pilot's
seat."</p>

<p>Tom managed a fleeting smile.</p>

<p>"Now, Corbett"&mdash;Strong's voice became businesslike&mdash;"as
you know, these manual tests are the last tests before
actually blasting off. In the past weeks, you cadets
have been subjected to every possible examination, to
discover any flaw in your work that might later crop up
in space. This manual operations test of the control
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>board, like Manning's on the radar bridge and Astro's
on the power deck, is designed to test you under simulated
space conditions. If you pass this test, your next
step is real space."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I warn you, it isn't easy. And if you fail, you personally
will wash out, and if other members of the unit do
not get a high enough mark to average out to a passing
grade for all of you, you fail as a unit."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"All right, then we'll begin. Your crew is aboard, the
air lock is closed. What is the first thing you do?"</p>

<p>"Adjust the air circulating system to ensure standard
Earth conditions."</p>

<p>"How do you do that?"</p>

<p>"By pressing this button which will activate the servo
units. They automatically keep the circulating pumps
in operation, based on thermostatic readings from the
main gauge." Tom pointed to a black clock face, with a
luminous white hand and numbers.</p>

<p>"All right, carry on," said Strong.</p>

<p>Tom reached over the huge control board that extended
around him for some two feet on three sides. He
placed a nervous finger on a small button, waited for
the gauge below to register with a swing of the hand,
and then released it. "All pressures steady, sir."</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"Check the crew, sir&mdash;all departments&mdash;" replied
Tom.</p>

<p>"Carry on," said Strong.</p>

<p>Tom reached out and pulled a microphone toward
him.</p>

<p>"All hands! Station check!" said Tom, and then was
startled to hear a metallic voice answer him.</p>

<p>"Power deck, ready for blast-off!" And then another
voice: "Radar deck, ready for blast-off!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom leaned back in the pilot's seat and turned to the
captain. "All stations ready, sir."</p>

<p>"Good! What next?" asked Strong.</p>

<p>"Ask spaceport tower for blast-off clearance&mdash;"</p>

<p>Strong nodded. Tom turned back to the microphone,
and without looking, punched a button in front of him.</p>

<p>"Rocket cruiser&mdash;" He paused and turned back to
Strong. "What name do I give, sir?"</p>

<p>Strong smiled. "<i>Noah's Ark</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rocket cruiser <i>Noah's Ark</i> to spaceport control! Request
blast-off clearance and orbit."</p>

<p>Once again a thin metallic voice answered him and
gave the necessary instructions.</p>

<p>On and on, through every possible command, condition
or decision that would be placed in front of him,
Tom guided his imaginary ship on its imaginary flight
through space. For two hours he pushed buttons,
snapped switches and jockeyed controls. He gave orders
and received them from the thin metallic voices.
They answered him with such accuracy, and sometimes
with seeming hesitation, that Tom found it difficult to
believe that they were only electronically controlled
recording devices. Once, when supposedly blasting
through space at three-quarters space speed, he received
a warning from the radar bridge of an approaching
asteroid. He asked for a course change, but in reply
received only static. Believing the recording to have
broken down, he turned inquiringly to Captain Strong,
but received only a blank stare in return. Tom hesitated
for a split second, then turned back to the controls. He
quickly flipped the teleceiver button on and began plotting
the course of the approaching asteroid, ignoring
for the moment his other duties on the control deck.
When he had finished, he gave the course shift to the
power deck and ordered a blast on the starboard jet. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>waited for the course change, saw it register on the
gauges in front of him, then continued his work.</p>

<p>Strong suddenly leaned over and clapped him on the
back enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Good work, Corbett. That broken recording was put
there intentionally to trap you. Not one cadet in twenty
would have had the presence of mind you showed in
plotting the course of that asteroid yourself."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," stammered Tom.</p>

<p>"That's all&mdash;the test is over. Return to your quarters."
He came over and laid a hand on Tom's shoulder.
"And don't worry, Corbett. While it isn't customary to
tell a cadet, I think you deserve it. You've passed with
a perfect score!"</p>

<p>"I have, sir? You mean&mdash;<i>I really passed?</i>"</p>

<p>"Next step is Manning," said Strong. "You've done as
much as one cadet can do."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir"&mdash;Tom could only repeat it over and
over&mdash;"thank you, sir&mdash;thank you."</p>

<p>Dazed, he saluted his superior and turned to the
door. Two hours in the pilot's chair had made him
dizzy. But he was happy.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he slammed back the sliding door
and entered the quarters of 42-D with a lusty shout.</p>

<p>"Meet Space Cadet Corbett&mdash;an Earthworm who's
just passed his control-deck manual operations exam!"</p>

<p>Astro looked up from a book of tables on astrogation
and gave Tom a wan smile.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Tom," he said, and turned back to
his book, adding bitterly, "but if I don't get these tables
down by this afternoon for my power-deck manual,
you're sunk."</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;what's going on here?" asked Tom. "Where's
Roger? Didn't he help you with them?"</p>

<p>"He left. Said he had to see someone before taking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>his radar-bridge manual. He helped me a little. But
when I'd ask him a question, he'd just rattle the answer
off so fast&mdash;well, I just couldn't follow him."</p>

<p>Suddenly slamming the book shut, he got up. "Me
and these tables"&mdash;he indicated the book&mdash;"just don't
mix!"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I can get the easy ones about astrogation.
They're simple. But it's the ones where I have to <i>combine</i>
it with the power deck."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I mean&mdash;what specifically?" asked Tom
softly.</p>

<p>"For instance, I've got to find the ratio for compression
on the main firing tubes, using a given amount of
fuel, heading for a given destination, and taking a
given time for the passage."</p>

<p>"But that's control-deck operations&mdash;as well as astrogation
and power!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;I know," answered Astro, "but I've still got
to be able to do it. If anything happened to you two
guys and I didn't know how to get you home, then
what?"</p>

<p>Tom hesitated. Astro was right. Each member of the
unit had to depend on the other in any emergency. And
if one of them failed ...? Tom saw why the ground
manuals were so important now.</p>

<p>"Look," offered Tom. "Suppose we go over the whole
thing again together. Maybe you're fouled up on the
basic concept."</p>

<p>Tom grabbed a chair, hitched it close to the desk and
pulled Astro down beside him. He opened the book and
began studying the problem.</p>

<p>"Now look&mdash;you have twenty-two tons of fuel&mdash;and
considering the position of your ship in space&mdash;"</p>

<p>As the two boys, their shoulders hunched over the
table, began reviewing the table of ratios, across the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>quadrangle in the examination hall Roger Manning
stood in a replica of a rocket ship's radar bridge and
faced Captain Strong.</p>

<p>"Cadet Manning reporting for manual examination,
sir." Roger brought up his arm in a crisp salute to Captain
Strong, who returned it casually.</p>

<p>"Stand easy, Manning," replied Strong. "Do you recognize
this room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It's a mock-up of a radar bridge."</p>

<p>"A workable mock-up, cadet!" Strong was vaguely
irritated by Roger's nonchalance in accepting a situation
that Tom had marveled at. "You will take your
manuals here!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"On these tests you will be timed for both efficiency
and speed and you'll use all the tables, charts and astrogation
equipment that you'd find in a spaceship. Your
problems are purely mathematical. There are no decisions
to make. Just use your head."</p>

<p>Strong handed Roger several sheets of paper containing
written problems. Roger shuffled them around in
his fingers, giving each a quick glance.</p>

<p>"You may begin any time you are ready, Manning,"
said Strong.</p>

<p>"I'm ready now, sir," replied Roger calmly. He
turned to the swivel chair located between the huge
communications board, the adjustable chart table and
the astrogation prism. Directly in front of him was the
huge radar scanner, and to one side and overhead was a
tube mounted on a swivel joint that looked like a small
telescope, but which was actually an astrogation prism
for taking sights on the celestial bodies in space.</p>

<p>Roger concentrated on the first problem.</p>

<p>" ... you are now in the northwest quadrant of
Mars, chart M, area twenty-eight. You have been notified
by the control deck that it has been necessary to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>jettison three quarters of your fuel supply. For the last
five hundred and seventy-nine seconds you have been
blasting at one-quarter space speed. The four main
drive rockets were cut out at thirty-second intervals.
Making adjustment for degree of slip on each successive
rocket cutout, find present position by using cross-fix
with Regulus as your starboard fix, Alpha Centauri
as your port fix."</p>

<p>Suddenly a bell began to ring in front of Roger. Without
hesitation he adjusted a dial that brought the radar
scanner into focus. When the screen remained blank,
he made a second adjustment, and then a third and
fourth, until the bright white flash of a meteor was seen
on the scanner. He quickly grabbed two knobs, one in
each hand, and twisted them to move two thin, plotting
lines, one horizontal and one vertical, across the surface
of the scanner. Setting the vertical line, he fingered a
tabulating machine with his right hand, as he adjusted
the second line with his left, thus cross-fixing the meteor.
Then he turned his whole attention to the tabulator,
ripped off the answer with lightning moves of his
fingers and began talking rapidly into the microphone.</p>

<p>"Radar bridge to control deck! Alien body bearing
zero-one-five, one-point-seven degrees over plane of the
ecliptic. On intersecting orbit. Change course two degrees,
hold for fifteen seconds, then resume original
heading. Will compensate for change nearer destination!"</p>

<p>Roger watched the scanner a moment longer. When
the rumbling blast of the steering jets sounded in the
chamber and the meteor flash shifted on the scanner
screen, he returned to the problem in his hand.</p>

<p>Seven minutes later he turned to Strong and handed
him the answer.</p>

<p>"Present position by dead reckoning is northwest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>quadrant of Mars, chart O, area thirty-nine, sir," he
announced confidently.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/im068.png" width="389" height="480" alt="&quot;I was unable to get a sight on Alpha Centauri&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I was unable to get a sight on Alpha Centauri&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Strong tried to mask his surprise, but a lifted eyebrow
gave him away. "And how did you arrive at this
conclusion, Manning?"</p>

<p>"I was unable to get a sight on Alpha Centauri due
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>to the present position of Jupiter, sir," replied Roger
easily. "So I took a fix on Earth, allowed for its rotational
speed around the sun and took the cross-fix with
Regulus as ordered in the problem. Of course, I included
all the other factors of the speed and heading
of our ship. That was routine."</p>

<p>Strong accepted the answer with a curt nod, motioning
for Roger to continue. It would not do, thought
Strong, to let Manning know that he was the first cadet
in thirty-nine years to make the correct selection of
Earth in working up the fix with Regulus, and still have
the presence of mind to plot a meteor without so much
as a half-degree error. Of course the problem varied
with each cadet, but it remained essentially the same.</p>

<p>"Seven-and-a-half minutes. Commander Walters will
be surprised, to say the least," thought Steve.</p>

<p>Forty-five minutes later, Roger, as unruffled as if he
had been sitting listening to a lecture from a sound
slide, handed in the rest of his papers, executed a sharp
salute and walked out.</p>

<p>"Two down and one to go," thought Strong, and the
toughest one of them all coming up. Astro. The big Venusian
was unable to understand anything that couldn't
be turned with a wrench. The only thing that would
prevent Unit 42-D from taking Academy unit honors
over Unit 77-K, the unit assigned to Lieutenant Wolcheck,
would be Astro. While none of the members of
the other units could come up to the individual brilliance
of Corbett or Manning, they worked together as
a unit, helping one another. They might make a higher
unit rating, simply because they were better balanced.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and collected the papers.
It was as much torture for him, as it was for any cadet,
he thought, and turned to the door. "All right, Astro,"
he said to himself, "in ten minutes it'll be your turn and
I'm going to make it tough!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>Back in the quarters of Unit 42-D, Tom and Astro still
pored over the books and papers on the desk.</p>

<p>"Let's try again, Astro," sighed Tom as he hitched his
chair closer to the desk. "You've got thirty tons of fuel&mdash;you
want to find the compression ratio of the number-one
firing-tube chamber&mdash;so what do you do?"</p>

<p>"Start up the auxiliary, burn a little of the stuff and
judge what it'll be," the big cadet replied. "That's the
way I did it on the space freighters."</p>

<p>"But you're not on a space freighter now!" exclaimed
Tom. "You've got to do things the way they want it
done here at the Academy. By the book! These tables
have been figured out by great minds to help you, and
you just want to burn a little of the stuff and guess at
what it'll be!" Tom threw up his hands in disgust.</p>

<p>"Seems to me I heard of an old saying back in the
teen centuries about leading a horse to water, but not
being able to make him drink!" drawled Roger from the
doorway. He strolled in and kicked at the crumpled
sheets of paper that littered the floor, stark evidence of
Tom's efforts with Astro.</p>

<p>"All right, wise guy," said Tom, "suppose you explain
it to him!"</p>

<p>"No can do," replied Roger. "I tried. I explained it to
him twenty times this morning while you were taking
your control-deck manual." He tapped his head delicately
with his forefinger. "Can't get through&mdash;too
thick!"</p>

<p>Astro turned to the window to hide the mist in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Lay off, Roger," snapped Tom. He got up and
walked over to the big cadet. "Come on, Astro, we
haven't got much time. You're due in the examination
hall in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"It's no good, Tom, I just can't understand that
stuff." Astro turned and faced his unit-mates, his voice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>charged with sudden emotion. "Just fifteen minutes on
the power deck of anything with rockets in her and I'll
run her from here to the next galaxy. I&mdash;I can't explain
it, but when I look at those motors, I can read 'em like
you read an astrogation chart, Roger, or you the gauges
on the control deck, Tom. But I just can't get those ratios
out of a book. I gotta put my hands on those motors&mdash;touch
'em&mdash;I mean really <i>touch 'em</i>&mdash;then I know
what to do!"</p>

<p>As suddenly as he had started, he stopped and
turned, leaving Tom and Roger staring at him, startled
by this unusual outburst.</p>

<p>"Cadets&mdash;stand <i>to</i>!" roared a voice from the doorway.</p>

<p>The three cadets snapped to attention and faced the
entrance.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Earthworms!" said Tony Richards. A
tall cadet with closely cut black hair and a lazy, smiling
face stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Lay off, Richards," said Tom. "We haven't time for
gags now. Astro's going to take his power-deck manual
in a few minutes and we're cramming with him."</p>

<p>"O.K.&mdash;O.K.&mdash;don't blow your jets," said Richards. "I
just wanted to see if there were any bets on which unit
would cop honors in the manuals this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think your Unit 77-K will finish on
top?" drawled Roger.</p>

<p>"I'd like to bet all the galley demerits we have in
77-K against yours."</p>

<p>"With Astro on our team?" complained Roger.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Astro?" asked Richards.
"From what I hear, he's hot stuff!" It wasn't a compliment,
but a sharp dig made with a sly smile. Astro
balled his huge hands into fists.</p>

<p>"Astro," said Roger, "is the type that can smell out
trouble on any power deck. But today he came down
with a cold. No, I'm afraid it's no bet, Richards."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'll give you two to one," Richards offered.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," replied Roger. "Not even at five to
one. Not with Astro."</p>

<p>Richards grinned, nodded and disappeared.</p>

<p>Roger turned to face the hard stare of Tom.</p>

<p>"That was the dirtiest sellout I've ever heard, Manning,"
Tom growled.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Corbett," said Roger. "I only bet on sure
things."</p>

<p>"That's O.K. with me, Manning," said Astro, "but I'm
afraid you sold yourself a hot rocket, because I'm going
to pass!"</p>

<p>"Who are you kidding?" Roger laughed and sprawled
on his bunk.</p>

<p>Astro took a quick step forward, his fists clenched,
his face a mask of burning anger, but Tom quickly
jumped in front of him.</p>

<p>"You'll be late for the exam, Astro!" he shouted. "Get
going or it'll count against your mark!"</p>

<p>"Huh. What's a few points more or less when you're
going to fail anyway," snorted Roger from the bunk.</p>

<p>Again, Astro started to lunge forward and Tom
braced himself against the Venusian's charge, but suddenly
the burly cadet stopped. Disengaging Tom's restraining
arms, he spoke coldly to the sneering boy on
the bed.</p>

<p>"I'm going to pass the exam, Manning. Get that? I'm
going to pass and then come back and beat your head
off!" Turning on his heel, he stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>Tom immediately wheeled to face Roger, fire in his
eyes, and the arrogant cadet, sensing trouble, jumped
to his feet to meet him.</p>

<p>"What's the idea of giving Astro a hard time?" demanded
Tom.</p>

<p>"Cool off, Corbett," replied Roger warily. "You're fusing
your tubes you're so hot."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>"You bet I'm hot! Hot enough to blast you&mdash;again!"
Tom deliberately spat out the last word.</p>

<p>Roger flushed and brought his fists up quickly as
though to charge in, then suddenly dropped them
again. He turned to the door and slowly walked out.</p>

<p>"Go blow your jets," his voice drifted back to Tom as
he disappeared.</p>

<p>Tom stood there, looking at the empty door, almost
blind with rage and frustration. He was failing in the
main job assigned to him, that of keeping the unit on
an even keel and working together. How could he command
a crew out in space if he couldn't keep the friction
of his own unit under control?</p>

<p>Slowly, he left the room to wait for Astro in the recreation
hall where the results of the manuals would be
announced. He thought of Astro, now probably deep in
his exam, and wondered how bad it would be for him.
Then another thought crossed his mind. Roger had
said nothing of his own test and neither he nor Astro
had even inquired.</p>

<p>He shook his head. No matter where the unit placed
in the manuals, it just couldn't stay together.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_7" id="CHAPTER_7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>


<p>It was customary for all Earthworm cadets to gather in
the main recreation hall to wait for the results of the
manuals which would be announced on the huge teleceiver
screen. Since all the units were taking their tests
that afternoon, the hall was crowded with green-clad
cadets, talking in low murmurs and waiting tensely for
the outcome of the exam.</p>

<p>Tom entered the huge room, looked around and then
drifted toward Al Dixon, the senior cadet who had
greeted them as a unit after passing classification tests.
The blue-clad cadet was listening to a story spool, a device
that told a story, rather than let the person read it
from a book.</p>

<p>"Hiya, Corbett," said Dixon, smiling. "Drag up a chair.
Listening to a terrific yarn about a guy stranded on an
asteroid and then he finds&mdash;" The redheaded cadet's
voice trailed off when he noticed that Tom wasn't listening.</p>

<p>"Say, what's the matter with you? You look like you
just lost your best friend."</p>

<p>"Not yet, but it won't be long now," commented
Tom, a trace of bitterness creeping into his voice. "Astro's
taking his power-deck manual. What he knows
about those compression ratios just isn't known. But he
just can't get it on paper."</p>

<p>"Don't sell your unit-mate short," said Dixon, sensing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>something beneath Tom's comment. "I've heard that
big fellow knows more about a rocket deck than McKenny."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's true," said Tom, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know, Corbett," said Dixon, switching off the
story spool, "there's something screwy in that outfit of
yours."</p>

<p>"You can say that again," agreed Tom bitterly.</p>

<p>"You come in here with a face dragging on the floor,
and Manning&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom's head jerked up. "Manning! What about that
space-gassing hot-shot?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Manning just tore through the rec hall trying to
get some of the other Earthworm units to bet their galley
demerits against your outfit."</p>

<p>Tom's mouth sagged open. "You mean, he actually
wanted to bet that Astro would pass?"</p>

<p>"Not just pass, Corbett, but he wanted to bet that
your unit would be top rocket of the Earthworms! The
head of the list!"</p>

<p>"But he told Astro that&mdash;" he stopped.</p>

<p>"Told him what?" Dixon asked.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;" said Tom. He jumped up
and headed for the door.</p>

<p>"Hey, where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To find Manning. There are a couple of things I
want to clear up."</p>

<p>Tom left Dixon shaking his head in bewilderment
and jumped on the slidestairs. He was going to have it
out with Roger once and for all. Hopping off the slidestairs
onto the forty-second floor, he started down the
long hall to his quarters.</p>

<p>Nearing the door, he heard Roger's laugh, and then
his lazy voice talking to someone inside.</p>

<p>"Sure, they're dumb, but they're not bad guys," said
Roger.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom walked into the room. Roger was sitting on the
side of his bunk facing Tony Richards.</p>

<p>"Hiya, Corbett," said Roger, "did you hear how Astro
made out yet?"</p>

<p>Tom ignored the question.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you, Roger."</p>

<p>Roger eyed him suspiciously. "Sure, Corbett, go
ahead."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be going along," said Richards. He had
heard about the previous fight between Manning and
Corbett and didn't want to be hauled up as a witness
later if they started again. "Remember, Manning," he
called from the doorway, "the bet is two to one, and are
you going to get tired of washing pots and pans!" He
waved his hand at Corbett and disappeared.</p>

<p>"All right, Corbett," Roger turned to Tom. "What's
frying you?"</p>

<p>"I just saw Al Dixon down in the rec hall," answered
Tom. "He told me you were looking for bets on the unit
ratings. Is that why Richards was here?"</p>

<p>"That's right," nodded Roger.</p>

<p>"What made you say the things you did to Astro before
he went for his manual?"</p>

<p>"Very simple. I wanted to make him pass and that
was the only way."</p>

<p>"You're pretty sure of yourself, Roger."</p>

<p>"I'm always sure of myself, Corbett. And the sooner
you learn that, the easier it'll be for all of us. I never bet
unless it's in the bag. I know Astro's going to pass. Some
guys have to have a fire built under them before they
get moving. Astro's one of them."</p>

<p>"That doesn't answer my question," said Tom. "Why
did you say the things you did before a guy goes to take
an exam?"</p>

<p>"I said what I did to make Tony Richards give me
odds. <i>And</i> to make Astro mad enough to pass. We're a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>cinch to win and Richards' outfit will be indebted to us
for a year's worth of galley demerits." He smiled easily.
"Smooth, huh?"</p>

<p>"I think it's rotten," said Tom. "Astro left here feeling
like a plugged credit! And if he does fail, it'll be because
you made him think he was the dumbest guy in
the universe!"</p>

<p>"He probably is," mused Roger, "but he still won't
fail that manual."</p>

<p>From the hallway behind them, a loud blasting yell
was suddenly heard, echoing from somewhere on the
lower floors. Tom and Roger waited, their eyes wide
and hopeful. There was only one person at Space Academy
capable of making such a noise.</p>

<p>"He made it!" Tom exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of course he made it," said Roger casually.</p>

<p>Astro tore into 42-D with a mad rush.</p>

<p>"Yeeeoooooowwww!" He grabbed the two cadets and
picked them up, one in each hand. "I made it&mdash;hands
down&mdash;I handled those rocket motors like they were
babes in arms! I told you that all I had to do was touch
them and I'd know! I told you!"</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Astro," said Tom with a wide grin.
"I knew you'd do it."</p>

<p>"Put me down, you oversized Venusian jerk," said
Roger, almost good-naturedly. Astro released the
smaller cadet and faced him.</p>

<p>"Well, hot-shot, I promised you something when I
got back, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Make it later, will you, and I'll be glad to oblige."
He walked toward the door. "I've got to go down and
collect a bet."</p>

<p>"What bet?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"With Tony Richards."</p>

<p>"But I thought you were afraid to bet on me!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not at all, Astro. I just wanted to make you mad
enough to ensure my winning."</p>

<p>"That sounds like you were more worried about your
bet than you were about Astro passing," snapped Tom.</p>

<p>"You're exactly right, spaceboy," purred Roger,
standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"That's our boy, Manning," growled Astro. "The
great team man!"</p>

<p>"Team?" Roger took a step back into the room.
"Don't make me laugh, Astro. For your information, tomorrow
morning I'm putting in for a transfer to another
unit!"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Tom. "You can't trans&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," interrupted Roger. "Read your Academy
regs. Anyone can request a transfer once the unit has
passed its manuals."</p>

<p>"And what excuse are you going to use," snapped Astro
bitterly. "That you can't take it?"</p>

<p>"A personality difference, Astro, my boy. You hate
me and I hate you. It's a good enough reason, I think."</p>

<p>"It's just as well, hot-shot," replied Astro. "Because if
you don't transfer, we will!"</p>

<p>Roger merely smiled, flipped his fingers to his forehead
in an arrogant gesture of farewell and turned to
leave again. But his path was blocked by the sudden
appearance of Captain Steve Strong. The three cadets
quickly braced.</p>

<p>The Solar Guard officer strode into the room, his face
beaming. He looked at each of the boys, pride shining
out of his eyes, and then brought his hand up and held
it in salute.</p>

<p>"I just want to tell you boys one thing," he said solemnly.
"It's the highest compliment I can pay you, or
anyone." He paused. "All three of you are real spacemen!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom and Astro couldn't repress smiles, but Roger's
expression never changed.</p>

<p>"Then we passed as a unit, sir?" asked Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not only passed, Corbett"&mdash;Strong's voice boomed in
the small room&mdash;"but with honors. You're the top rockets
of this Earthworm group! I'm proud to be your commanding
officer!"</p>

<p>Again Tom and Astro fought back smiles of happiness
and even Roger managed a small grin.</p>

<p>"This is the fightingest group of cadets I've ever
seen," Strong continued. "Frankly, I was a little worried
about your ability to pull together but the results of the
manuals showed that you have. You couldn't have made
it without working as a unit."</p>

<p>Strong failed to notice Roger's face darken, and Tom
and Astro look at each other meaningfully.</p>

<p>"My congratulations for having solved that problem
too!" Strong saluted them again and walked toward the
door, where he paused. "By the way, I want you to report
to the Academy spaceport tomorrow at eight hundred
hours. Warrant Officer McKenny has something
out there he wants to show you."</p>

<p>Tom's eyes bugged out and he stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Sir," he gasped, scarcely able to get the question
past his lips, "you don't mean we're&mdash;we're going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're absolutely right, Corbett. There's a brand-new
rocket cruiser out there. Your ship. Your future
classroom. You'll report to her in the blues of the Space
Cadets! And from now on your unit identification is the
name of your ship! The rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>!"</p>

<p>A second later, Strong had vanished down the corridor,
leaving Tom and Astro hugging each other and
clapping each other on the back in delirious joy.</p>

<p>Roger merely stood to one side, a sarcastic smile on
his face.</p>

<p>"And now, as we prepare to face the unknown dangers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>of space," he said bitingly, "let us unite our voices
and sing the Academy hymn together! Huh!" He strode
toward the door. "Don't they ever get tired of waving
that flag around here?"</p>

<p>Before Tom and Astro could reply, he had disappeared.
The big Venusian shrugged his shoulders. "I
just don't understand that guy!"</p>

<p>But Tom failed to reply. He had turned toward the
window and was staring out past the gleaming white
Tower of Galileo into the slowly darkening skies of evening
to the east. For the moment, the problems of Roger
Manning and the unit were far away. He was thinking
of the coming morning when he would dress in the
blues of a Space Cadet for the first time and step into
his own ship as command pilot. He was thinking of the
morning when he would be a real spaceman!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_8" id="CHAPTER_8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>


<p>The campus of Space Academy was quiet that evening.
Only a few cadets were still out on the quadrangle,
lounging around in the open before returning to their
quarters for bed-check.</p>

<p>On the forty-second floor of the dormitory building,
two thirds of the newly formed <i>Polaris</i> unit, Tom and
Astro, were in heated argument.</p>

<p>"All right, all right, so the guy is brilliant," said Astro.
"But who can live with him? Not even himself!"</p>

<p>"Maybe he is a little difficult," replied Tom, "but
somehow, we've got to adjust to him!"</p>

<p>"How about him adjusting to us? It's two against
one!" Astro shambled to the window and looked out
moodily. "Besides, he's putting in for a transfer and
there's nothing we can do about it!"</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't now&mdash;not after that little speech
Captain Strong made this afternoon."</p>

<p>"If he doesn't, then, blast it, I will!"</p>

<p>"Aw, now take it easy, Astro!"</p>

<p>"Take it easy, nothing!" Astro was building up a big
head of steam. "Where is that space crawler right now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He never came back. Wasn't even
down at mess tonight."</p>

<p>"There, that's just what I mean!" Astro turned to
Tom to press his point. "It's close to bed-check and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>isn't in quarters yet. If the MP's catch him outside after
hours, the whole unit will be logged and there goes our
chance of blasting off tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"But there's still time, Astro," replied Tom lamely.</p>

<p>"Not much there isn't. It just shows you what he
thinks of the unit! He just doesn't care!" Astro paced
the floor angrily. "There's only one thing to do! He gets
his transfer&mdash;or we do! Or&mdash;" he paused and looked at
Tom meaningfully, "or I do."</p>

<p>"You're not thinking, Astro," argued Tom. "How will
that look on your record? Every time there's a trip into
deep space, they yank out your file to see how you operate
under pressure with other guys. When they see
that you asked for a transfer from your unit, that's it!"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;yeah&mdash;I know&mdash;incompatible&mdash;but honest,
Tom&mdash;"</p>

<p>The curly-haired cadet felt his big friend weaken and
he pressed his advantage.</p>

<p>"It isn't every day that a unit gets a ship right after
finishing ground manuals. Captain Strong said he
waited for four months after manuals before getting his
first hop into space."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;but what do you think it's going to be like
out in space with Manning making sour cracks all the
time?"</p>

<p>Tom hesitated before answering his Venusian friend.
He was fully aware that Roger was going to play a lone
hand. And that they would never really have unity
among them until some drastic measure was taken.
After all, Tom thought, some guys don't have good
hearts, or eyes, a defect to prevent them from becoming
spacemen. Roger is just mixed up inside. And the
handicap is just as real as if he had a physical flaw.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want to do?" asked Tom finally.</p>

<p>"Go see Captain Strong. Give it to him straight. Tell
him we want a transfer."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>"But tomorrow we blast off. We might not have another
chance for months! Certainly not until we get a
new astrogator."</p>

<p>"I'd rather wait and have a guy on the radar bridge
I know isn't going to pull something behind my back,"
said Astro, "than blast off tomorrow with Manning
aboard."</p>

<p>Again Tom hesitated. He knew what Astro was saying
was the truth. Life, so far, at the Academy had been
tough enough, but with mutual dependence and security
even more important out in space, the danger of
their constant friction was obvious.</p>

<p>"O.K.," he relented, "if that's the way you really want
it. Come on. We'll go see Captain Strong now."</p>

<p>"You go," said Astro. "You know how I feel. Whatever
you say goes for me too."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you want to do it?" asked Tom. He
knew what such a request would mean. A black mark
against Roger for being rejected by his unit-mates and
a black mark against Astro and himself for not being
able to adjust. Regardless of who was right and who
was wrong, there would always be a mark on their records.</p>

<p>"Look, Tom," said Astro, "if I thought it was only me
I'd keep my mouth shut. But you'd let Manning get
away with murder because you wouldn't want to be the
one to get him into trouble."</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't," said Tom. "I think Roger would
make a fine spaceman; he's certainly smart enough, and
a good unit-mate if he'd only snap out of it. But I can't
let him or anyone else stop me from becoming a spaceman
or a member of the Solar Guard."</p>

<p>"Then you'll go see Captain Strong?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom. If he had been in doubt before, now
that he had made the decision, he felt relieved. He
slipped on his space boots and stood up. The two boys
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>looked at each other, each realizing the question in the
other's mind.</p>

<p>"No!" said Tom decisively. "It's better for everyone.
Even Roger. He might find two other guys that will fit
him better." He walked from the room.</p>

<p>The halls were silent as he strode toward the slidestairs
that would take him to the nineteenth floor and
Captain Strong's quarters. Passing one room after another,
he glanced in and saw other units studying, preparing
for bed, or just sitting around talking. There
weren't many units left. The tests had taken a toll of the
Earthworms. But those that remained were solidly
built. Already friendships had taken deep root. Tom
found himself wishing he had become a member of another
unit. Where the comradeship was taken for
granted in other units, he was about to make a request
to dissolve his because of friction.</p>

<p>Completely discouraged, Tom stepped on the slidestairs
and started down.</p>

<p>As he left the dormitory floors, the noise of young
cadet life was soon lost and he passed floors containing
offices and apartments of the administration staff of the
Solar Guard.</p>

<p>As he drew level with the floor that was Galaxy Hall,
he glanced at the lighted plaque and for the hundredth
time reread the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p>" ... to the brave men who sacrificed their lives in
the conquest of space, this Galaxy Hall is dedicated...."</p>

<p>Something moved in the darkness of the hall. Tom
strained his eyes for a closer look and just managed to
distinguish the figure of a cadet standing before the
wreckage of the <i>Space Queen</i>. Funny, thought Tom.
Why should anyone be wandering around the hall at
this time of night? And then, as the floor slipped past,
the figure turned slightly and was illuminated by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>dim light that came from the slidestairs. Tom recognized
the sharp features and close-cropped blond hair
of Roger Manning!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<img src="images/im085.png" width="382" height="480" alt="Roger was still standing in front of the Space Queen!" title="" />
<span class="caption">Roger was still standing in front of the Space Queen!</span>
</div>

<p>Quickly changing over to the slidestairs going up,
Tom slipped back to the hall floor and stepped off.
Roger was still standing in front of the <i>Space Queen</i>!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom started to speak, but stopped when he saw
Roger take out a handkerchief and dab at his eyes.</p>

<p>The movements of the other boy were crystal-clear to
Tom. Roger was crying! Standing in front of the <i>Space
Queen</i> and crying!</p>

<p>He kept watching as Roger put away the handkerchief,
saluted sharply and turned toward the slidestairs.
Ducking behind a glass case that held the first space
suit ever used, Tom held his breath as Roger passed
him. He could hear Roger mumble.</p>

<p>"They got you&mdash;but they won't get me with any of
that glory stuff!"</p>

<p>Tom waited, heart racing, trying to figure out what
Roger meant, and why he was here alone in Galaxy
Hall. Finally the blond cadet disappeared up the moving
stair.</p>

<p>Tom didn't go to see Captain Strong. Instead, he returned
to his room.</p>

<p>"So quick?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. "Where's Roger?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In the shower." Astro gestured to the bathroom,
where Tom could hear the sound of running water.
"What made you change your mind about seeing Captain
Strong?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"I think we've misjudged Roger, Astro," said Tom
slowly. And then related what he had seen and heard.</p>

<p>"Well, blast my jets!" exclaimed Astro, when Tom
had finished. "What's behind it, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Astro. But I'm convinced that any guy
that'll visit Galaxy Hall by himself late at night&mdash;and
<i>cry</i>&mdash;well, he couldn't be entirely off base, regardless
of what he does."</p>

<p>Astro studied his work-hardened palms.</p>

<p>"You wanta keep it this way for a while?" he asked.
"I mean, forget about talking to Captain Strong?"</p>

<p>"Roger's the best astrogator and radar man in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Academy, Astro. There's something bothering him. But
I'm willing to bet that whatever it is, Roger will work
it out. And if we're really unit-mates, then we won't sell
him out now, when he may need us most."</p>

<p>"That's it, then," said Astro. "I'll kill him with kindness.
Come on. Let's turn in. We've got a big day ahead
of us tomorrow!"</p>

<p>The two boys began to prepare for bed. Roger came
out of the shower wearing pajamas.</p>

<p>"All excited, spacemen?" he drawled, leaning against
the wall, brushing his short hair.</p>

<p>"About as excited as we can get, Roger," smiled Tom.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you space-blasting jerk!" growled Astro good-naturedly.
"Turn out the lights before I introduce you
to my space boot."</p>

<p>Roger eyed the two cadets quizzically, puzzled by
the strange good humor of both boys. He shrugged his
shoulders, flipped out the light and crawled into bed.</p>

<p>But if he could have seen the satisfied smile of Tom
Corbett, Roger would have been even more puzzled.</p>

<p>"We'll just kill him with kindness," thought Tom, and
fell fast asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_9" id="CHAPTER_9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>


<p>The three members of the <i>Polaris</i> unit stepped off the
slidewalk at the Academy spaceport and stood before
Warrant Officer McKenny.</p>

<p>"There she is," said the stubby spaceman, pointing to
the gleaming spaceship resting not two hundred feet
away. "Rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>. The newest and fastest
ship in space."</p>

<p>He faced the three boys with a smile. "And she's all
yours. You earned her!"</p>

<p>Mouths open, Tom, Roger and Astro stood gaping in
fascination at the mighty spaceship resting on the concrete
ramp. Her long two-hundred-foot polished beryllium
steel hull mirrored the spaceport scene around
them. The tall buildings of the Academy, the "ready"
line of space destroyers and scouts, and the hundreds of
maintenance noncoms of the enlisted Solar Guard,
their scarlet uniforms spotted with grime, were all reflected
back to the <i>Polaris</i> unit as they eyed the sleek
ship from the needlelike nose of her bow to the stubby
opening of her rocket exhausts. Not a seam or rivet
could be seen in her hull. At the top of the ship, near
her nose, a large blister made of six-inch clear crystal
indicated the radar bridge. Twelve feet below it, six
round window ports showed the position of the control
deck. Surrounding the base of the ship was an aluminum
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>scaffold with a ladder over a hundred feet high
anchored to it. The top rung of the ladder just reached
the power-deck emergency hatch which was swung
open, like a giant plug, revealing the thickness of the
hull, nearly a foot.</p>

<p>"Well," roared the red-clad spaceman, "don't you
want to climb aboard and see what your ship looks like
inside?"</p>

<p>"Do we!" cried Tom, and made a headlong dash for
the scaffold. Astro let out one of his famous yells and
followed right at his heels. Roger watched them running
ahead and started off at a slow walk, but suddenly,
no longer able to resist, he broke into a dead run. Those
around the <i>Polaris</i> stopped their work to watch the
three cadets scramble up the ladder. Most of the ground
crew were ex-spacemen like McKenny, no longer able
to blast off because of acceleration reaction. And they
smiled knowingly, remembering their reactions to their
first spaceship.</p>

<p>Inside the massive cruiser, the boys roamed over every
deck, examining the ship excitedly.</p>

<p>"Say look at this!" cried Tom. He stood in front of the
control board and ran his hands over the buttons and
switches. "This board makes the manual we worked on
at the Academy look like it's ready for Galaxy Hall!"</p>

<p>"Yeeeooooooww!" Three decks below, Astro had discovered
the rocket motors. Four of the most powerful
ever installed on a spaceship, enabling the <i>Polaris</i> to
outrace any ship in space.</p>

<p>Roger stuck his head through the radar-bridge hatch
and gazed in awe at the array of electronic communicators,
detection radar and astrogation gear. With lips
pulled into a thin line, he mumbled to himself: "Too
bad they didn't give <i>you</i> this kind of equipment."</p>

<p>"What'd you say, Roger?" asked Astro, climbing
alongside to peer into the radar bridge.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Startled, Roger turned and stammered, "Ah&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>Looking around, Astro commented, "This place looks
almost as good as that power deck."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Roger, "they could have placed that
astrogation prism a little closer to the chart table. Now
I'll have to get up every time I want to take sights on
stars!"</p>

<p>"Don't you ever get tired of complaining?" asked
Astro.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;rocket off," snarled Roger.</p>

<p>"Hey, you guys," yelled Tom from below, "better get
down here! Captain Strong's coming aboard."</p>

<p>Climbing back down the ladder to the control deck,
Astro leaned over his shoulder and asked Roger, "Do
you really think he'll let us take this baby up for a hop,
Manning?"</p>

<p>"Get your head out of that cloud, Astro. You'll pull
about three weeks of dry runs before this baby gets five
inches off the ground."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be too sure of that, Manning!" Strong's
voice boomed out as he climbed up through the control-deck
hatch. The three boys immediately snapped to
attention.</p>

<p>Strong walked around the control deck, fingering the
controls lightly.</p>

<p>"This is a fine ship," he mused aloud. "One of the finest
that scientific brains can build. She's yours. The day
you graduate from the Academy, <i>IF</i> you graduate, and
I can think of about a thousand reasons why you won't,
you'll command an armed rocket cruiser similar to this.
As a matter of fact, the only difference between this
ship and those that patrol the space lanes now is in the
armament."</p>

<p>"Don't we have any arms aboard at all, sir?" asked
Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Small arms, like paralo-ray pistols and paralo-ray rifles.
Plus four atomic war heads for emergency use," replied
Strong.</p>

<p>Seeing a puzzled expression cross Astro's face, the
Solar Guard officer continued, "You haven't studied armament
yet, Astro, but paralo rays are the only weapons
used by law-enforcement agencies in the Solar Alliance.
They work on a principle of controlled energy,
sending out a ray with an effective range of fifty yards
that can paralyze the nervous system of any beast or
human."</p>

<p>"And it doesn't kill, sir?" inquired Astro.</p>

<p>"No, Astro." replied Strong. "Paralyzing a man is just
as effective as killing him. The Solar Alliance doesn't
believe you have to kill anyone, not even the most vicious
criminal. Freeze him and capture him, and you
still have the opportunity of making him a useful citizen."</p>

<p>"But if you can't?" inquired Roger dryly.</p>

<p>"Then he's kept on the prison asteroid where he can't
harm anyone." Strong turned away abruptly. "But this
isn't the time for a general discussion. We've got work
to do!"</p>

<p>He walked over to the master control panel and
switched the teleceiver screen. There was a slight buzz,
and a view of the spaceport outside the ship suddenly
came into focus, filling the screen. Strong flipped a
switch and a view aft on the <i>Polaris</i> filled the glowing
square. The aluminum scaffolding was being hauled
away by a jet truck. Again the view changed as Strong
twisted the dials in front of him.</p>

<p>"Just scanning the outside, boys," he commented.
"Have to make sure there isn't anyone near the ship
when we blast off. The rocket exhaust is powerful
enough to blow a man two hundred feet, to say nothing
of burning him to death."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean, sir&mdash;" began Tom, not daring to hope.</p>

<p>"Of course, Corbett," smiled Strong. "Take your stations
for blast-off. We raise ship as soon as we get orbital
clearance from spaceport control!"</p>

<p>Without waiting for further orders, the three boys
scurried to their stations.</p>

<p>Soon the muffled whine of the energizing pumps on
the power deck began to ring through the ship, along
with the steady beep of the radar scanner on the radar
bridge. Tom checked the maze of gauges and dials on
the control board. Air locks, hatches, oxygen supply,
circulating system, circuits, and feeds. In five minutes
the two-hundred-foot shining steel hull was a living
thing as her rocket motors purred, warming up for the
initial thrust.</p>

<p>Tom made a last sweeping check of the complicated
board and turned to Captain Strong who stood to one
side watching.</p>

<p>"Ship ready to blast off, sir," he announced. "Shall I
check stations and proceed to raise ship?"</p>

<p>"Carry on, Cadet Corbett," Strong replied. "Log
yourself in as skipper with me along as supercargo. I'll
ride in the second pilot's chair."</p>

<p>Tom snapped a sharp salute and added vocally,
"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>He turned back to the control board, strapped himself
into the command pilot's seat and opened the circuit
to the spaceport control tower.</p>

<p>"Rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i> to spaceport control," he
droned into the microphone. "Check in!"</p>

<p>"Spaceport control to <i>Polaris</i>," the voice of the tower
operator replied. "You are cleared for blast-off in two
minutes. Take out&mdash;orbit 75 ... repeat ... 75...."</p>

<p>"<i>Polaris</i> to spaceport control. Orders received and
understood. End transmission!"</p>

<p>Tom then turned his attention to the station check.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Control deck to radar deck. Check in."</p>

<p>"Radar deck, aye! Ready to raise ship." Roger's voice
was relaxed, easy.</p>

<p>Tom turned to the board to adjust the teleceiver
screen for a clear picture of the stern of the ship. Gradually
it came up in as sharp detail as if he had been
standing on the ground.</p>

<p>He checked the electric timing device in front of him
that ticked off the seconds, as a red hand crawled
around to <i>zero</i>, and when it swept down to the thirty-second
mark, Tom pulled the microphone to his lips
again. "Control deck to power deck. Check in!"</p>

<p>"Power deck, aye?"</p>

<p>"Energize the cooling pumps!"</p>

<p>"Cooling pumps, aye!" repeated Astro.</p>

<p>"Feed reactant!"</p>

<p>"Reactant at D-9 rate."</p>

<p>From seventy feet below them, Strong and Tom
heard the hiss of the reactant mass feeding into the
rocket motors, and the screeching whine of the mighty
pumps that kept the mass from building too rapidly
and exploding.</p>

<p>The second hand swept up to the twenty-second
mark.</p>

<p>"Control deck to radar deck," called Tom. "Do we
have a clear trajectory forward?"</p>

<p>"All clear forward and overhead," replied Roger.</p>

<p>Tom placed his hand on the master switch that
would throw the combined circuits, instruments and
gauges into the single act of blasting the mighty ship
into space. His eyes glued to the sweeping hand, he
counted past the twelve-second mark&mdash;eleven&mdash;ten&mdash;nine&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stand by to raise ship," he bawled into the microphone.
"Minus&mdash;five&mdash;four&mdash;three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;<i>zero</i>!"</p>

<p>Tom threw the master switch.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a split-second pause and then the great
ship roared into life. Slowly at first, she lifted her tail
full of roaring jets free of the ground. Ten feet&mdash;twenty&mdash;fifty&mdash;a
hundred&mdash;five hundred&mdash;a thousand&mdash;picking
up speed at an incredible rate.</p>

<p>Tom felt himself being pushed deeper and deeper
into the softness of the acceleration cushions. He had
been worried about not being able to keep his eyes
open to see the dwindling Earth in the teleceiver over
his head, but the tremendous force of the rockets pushing
him against gravity to tear the two hundred tons of
steel away from the Earth's grip held his eyelids open
for him. As the powerful rockets tore deeper into the
gap that separated the ship from Earth, he saw the
spaceport gradually grow smaller. The rolling hills
around the Academy closed in, and then the Academy
itself, with the Tower of Galileo shrinking to a white
stick, was lost in the brown and green that was Earth.
The rockets pushed harder and harder and he saw the
needle of the acceleration gauge creep slowly up.
Four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten
miles a second!</p>

<p>When the awful crushing weight on his body seemed
unbearable, when he felt as though he would never be
able to draw another breath, suddenly the pressure
lifted and Tom felt amazingly and wonderfully buoyant.
He seemed to be floating in mid-air, his body rising
against the webbed straps of his chair! With a start and
a momentary wave of panic, he realized that he <i>was</i>
floating! Only the straps kept him from rising to the
ceiling of the control room!</p>

<p>Recovering quickly, he realized that he was in free
fall. The ship had cleared the pull of earth's gravity and
was out in space where everything was weightless.
Reaching toward the control panel, he flipped the
switch for the synthetic-gravity generator and, seconds
later, felt the familiar and reassuring sensation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>chair under him as the generator supplied an artificial-gravity
field to the ship.</p>

<p>As he loosened the straps in his chair, he noticed
Captain Strong rising from his position beside him and
he grinned sheepishly in answer to the twinkle in
Strong's eye.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Tom," reassured Strong. "Happens to
everyone the first time. Carry on."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied Tom and he turned to the microphone.
"Control deck to all stations! We are in
space! Observe standard cruise procedure!"</p>

<p>"Power deck, aye!" was Astro's blasting answer over
the loud-speaker. "Yeeeoooww! Out where we belong at
last."</p>

<p>"Radar bridge here," Roger's voice chimed in softly
on the speaker. "Everything under control. And, Astro,
you belong in a zoo if you're going to bellow like that!"</p>

<p>"Ahhh&mdash;rocket off, bubblehead!" The big Venusian's
reply was good-natured. He was too happy to let Roger
get under his skin.</p>

<p>"All right, you two," interrupted Tom. "Knock it off.
We're on a ship now. Let's cut the kindergarten stuff!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, skipper!" Astro was irrepressible.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>!" Roger's voice was soft but Tom recognized
the biting edge to the last word.</p>

<p>Turning away from the controls, he faced Captain
Strong who had been watching quietly.</p>

<p>"<i>Polaris</i> space-borne at nine hundred thirty-three
hours, Captain Strong. All stations operating efficiently."</p>

<p>"Very competent job, Corbett," nodded Strong in approval.
"You handled the ship as if you'd been doing it
for years."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"We'll just cruise for a while on this orbit so you boys
can get the feel of the ship and of space." The Solar
Guard officer took Tom's place in the command pilot's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>chair. "You knock off for a while. Go up to the radar
bridge and have a look around. I'll take over here."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Tom turned and had to restrain himself
from racing up the ladder to the radar bridge. When he
climbed through the hatch to Roger's station, he found
his unit-mate tilted back in his chair, staring through
the crystal blister over his head.</p>

<p>"Hiya, spaceboy," smiled Roger. He indicated the
blister. "Take a look at the wide, deep and high."</p>

<p>Tom looked up and saw the deep blackness that was
space.</p>

<p>"It's like looking into a mirror, Roger," he breathed
in awe. "Only there isn't any other side&mdash;no reflection.
It just doesn't stop, does it?"</p>

<p>"Nope," commented Roger, "it just goes on and on
and on. And no one knows where it stops. And no one
can even guess."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you've got a touch of space fever," laughed Astro.
"You'd better take it easy, pal."</p>

<p>Tom suppressed a smile. Now, for the first time, he
felt that there was a chance to achieve unity among
them. Kill him with kindness, he thought, that's the
way to do it.</p>

<p>"All right, boys!" Captain Strong's voice crackled
over the speaker. "Time to pull in your eyeballs and get
to work again. We're heading back to the spaceport!
Take your stations for landing!"</p>

<p>Tom and Astro immediately jumped toward the open
hatch and started scrambling down the ladder toward
their respective stations while Roger strapped himself
into his chair in front of the astrogation panel.</p>

<p>Within sixty seconds the ship was ready for landing
procedure and at a nod from Captain Strong, who again
strapped himself into the second pilot's chair, Tom began
the delicate operation.</p>

<p>Entering Earth's atmosphere, Tom gave a series of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>rapid orders for course changes and power adjustments,
and then, depressing the master turn control, spun the
ship around so that she would settle stern first toward
her ramp at the Academy spaceport.</p>

<p>"Radar deck to control deck," called Roger over the
intercom. "One thousand feet to touchdown!"</p>

<p>"Control deck, aye," answered Tom. "Control deck
to power deck. Check in."</p>

<p>"Power deck, aye," replied Astro.</p>

<p>"Stand by to adjust thrust to maximum drive at my
command," ordered Tom.</p>

<p>"Power deck, aye."</p>

<p>The great ship, balanced perfectly on the hot exhaust,
slowly slipped toward the ground.</p>

<p>"Five hundred feet to touchdown," warned Roger.</p>

<p>"Main rockets full blast," ordered Tom.</p>

<p>The sudden blast of the powerful jets slowed the descent
of the ship, and finally, fifty feet above the ground,
Tom snapped out another order.</p>

<p>"Cut main rockets! Hold auxiliary!"</p>

<p>A moment later there was a gentle bump and the
<i>Polaris</i> rested on the ramp, her nose pointed to the
heavens.</p>

<p>"<i>Touchdown!</i>" yelled Tom. "Cut everything, fellas,
and come up and sign the log. We made it&mdash;our first
hop into space! We're spacemen!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_10" id="CHAPTER_10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p>"The next event will be," Warrant Officer McKenny's
voice boomed over the loud-speaker and echoed over
the Academy stadium, "the last semifinal round of mercuryball.
<i>Polaris</i> unit versus <i>Arcturus</i> unit."</p>

<p>As two thousand space cadets, crowded in the grandstands
watching the annual academy tournament, rose
to their feet and cheered lustily, Tom Corbett turned to
his unit-mates Astro and Roger and called enthusiastically,
"O.K., fellas. Let's go out there and show them
how to play this game!"</p>

<p>During the two days of the tournament, Tom, Roger
and Astro, competing as a unit against all the other
academy units, had piled up a tremendous amount of
points in all the events. But so had Unit 77-K, now
known as the <i>Capella</i> unit. Now with the <i>Capella</i> unit
already in the finals, the <i>Polaris</i> crew had to win their
semifinal round against the <i>Arcturus</i>, in order to meet
the <i>Capella</i> in the final round for Academy honors.</p>

<p>"This is going to be a cinch," boasted Astro. "I'm going
to burn 'em up!"</p>

<p>"Save it for the field," said Tom with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you big Venusian ape," added Roger. "Make
points instead of space gas."</p>

<p>Stripped to the waist, wearing shorts and soft, three-quarter-length
space boots, the three boys walked onto
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>the sun-baked field amid the rousing cheers from the
stands. Across the field, the cadets of the <i>Arcturus</i> unit
walked out to meet them, stopping beside McKenny at
the mid-field line. Mike waited for the six boys to form
a circle around him, while he held the mercuryball, a
twelve-inch plastic sphere, filled with air and the tricky
tube of mercury.</p>

<p>"You all know the rules," announced McKenny
abruptly. "Head, shoulders, feet, knees, or any part of
your body except your hands, can touch the ball. <i>Polaris</i>
unit will defend the north goal," he said, pointing
to a white chalk line fifty yards away, "<i>Arcturus</i> the
south," and he pointed to a line equally distant in the
opposite direction. "Five-minute periods, with one-minute
rest between. All clear?"</p>

<p>As captain of the <i>Polaris</i> unit, Tom nodded, while
smiling at the captain of the <i>Arcturus</i> team, a tow-headed
boy with short chunky legs named Schohari.</p>

<p>"All clear, Mike," said Tom.</p>

<p>"All clear here, Mike," responded Schohari.</p>

<p>"All right, shake hands and take your places."</p>

<p>The six boys shook hands and jogged toward respective
opposite lines. Mike waited for them to reach their
goal lines, and then placed the ball in the middle of a
chalk-drawn circle.</p>

<p>Toeing the line, Tom, Roger and Astro eyed the <i>Arcturus</i>
crew and prepared for the dash to the ball.</p>

<p>"All right, fellas," urged Tom, "let's show them something!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," breathed Astro, "just let me get my size thirteens
on that pumpkin before it starts twisting around!"</p>

<p>Astro wanted the advantage of the first kick at the
ball while the mercury tube inside was still quiet. Once
the mercury was agitated, the ball would be as easy to
kick as a well-greased eel.</p>

<p>"We'll block for you, Astro," said Tom, "and you put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>every ounce of beef you've got into that first kick. If
we're lucky, we might be able to get the jump on them!"</p>

<p>"Cut the chatter," snapped Roger nervously. "Baldy's
ready to give us the go ahead!"</p>

<p>Standing on the side lines, Warrant Officer McKenny
slowly raised his hand, and the crowd in the grandstand
hushed in eager anticipation. A second passed and then
there was a tremendous roar as he brought his hand
down and blew heavily on the whistle.</p>

<p>Running as if their lives depended on it, the six cadets
of the two units raced headlong toward the ball. Tom,
just a little faster than Roger or Astro, flashed down the
field and veered off to block the advancing Schohari.
Roger, following him, charged into Swift, the second
member of the <i>Arcturus</i> crew. Astro, a few feet in back
of them, running with surprising speed for his size, saw
that it was going to be a close race between himself and
Allen, the third member of the <i>Arcturus</i> unit. He
bowed his head and drove himself harder, the roar of
the crowd filling his ears.</p>

<p>" ... Go Astro!... Go Astro!..."</p>

<p>Pounding down for the kick, Astro gauged his stride
perfectly and with one last, mighty leap swung his
right foot at the ball.</p>

<p>There was a loud thud drowned by a roar from the
crowd as the ball sailed off the ground with terrific
force. And then almost immediately there was another
thud as Allen rose in a desperate leap to block the ball
with his shoulder. It caromed off at a crazy angle, wobbling
in its flight as the mercury within rolled from side
to side. Swift, of the <i>Arcturus</i> crew, reached the ball first
and sent it sailing at an angle over Tom's head to bounce
thirty feet away. Seeing Astro charge the ball, Tom
threw a block on Allen to knock him out of the play.
The big Venusian, judging his stride to be a little off,
shortened his steps to move in for the kick. But just as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>he brought his foot forward to make contact, the ball
spun away to the left. Astro's foot continued in a perfect
arc over his head, throwing him in a heap on the
ground.</p>

<p>Two thousand voices from the stands roared in one
peal of laughter.</p>

<p>While Astro lay on the ground with the wind
knocked out of him, Schohari and Swift converged on
the ball. With Astro down and Tom out of position, the
<i>Arcturus</i> unit seemed certain of scoring. But again the
ball rolled crazily, this time straight to Roger, the last
defender. He nudged it between his opponents toward
Tom, who, in turn, kicked it obliquely past Allen back
to Roger again. Running with the grace and speed of an
antelope, the blond cadet met the ball in mid-field, and
when it dropped to the ground in front of him, sent it
soaring across the goal with one powerful kick!</p>

<p>As the cadets in the stands sent up a tumultuous
cheer for the perfectly executed play, the whistle blew,
ending the period and the <i>Polaris</i> unit led, one to nothing.</p>

<p>Breathing deeply, Astro and Roger flopped down
near Tom and stretched full length on the grass.</p>

<p>"That was a beautiful shot, Roger," said Tom. "Perfectly
timed!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, hot-shot," agreed Astro, "I'm glad to see that
big head of yours is good for something!"</p>

<p>"Listen, fellas," said Roger eagerly, ignoring Astro,
"to go into the finals against Richards and the <i>Capella</i>
unit, we've got to beat the <i>Arcturus</i> crew, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Tom, "and it won't be easy. We just
happened to get the breaks."</p>

<p>"Then why don't we put the game on ice?" said
Roger. "Freeze the ball! We got 'em one to nothing,
that's enough to beat them. When the whistle blows
and it's over, we win!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Astro looked at Tom, who frowned and replied, "But
we've still got three periods left, Roger. It isn't fair to
freeze this early in the game. If it was the last minute
or so, sure. But not so early. It just isn't fair."</p>

<p>"What do you want to do?" snarled Roger. "Win, or
play fair?"</p>

<p>"Win, of course, but I want to win the right way,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"How about you, Astro?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"I feel the same way that Tom does," said the big
cadet. "We can beat these guys easily&mdash;and on the
square."</p>

<p>"You guys make it sound like I was cheating,"
snapped Roger.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom, "it sure isn't giving the <i>Arcturus</i>
guys a break."</p>

<p>The whistle blew for them to return to the goal line.</p>

<p>"Well," asked Roger, "do we freeze or don't we?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to. But majority always rules in this
unit, Roger." Tom glanced at Astro. "How about it,
Astro?"</p>

<p>"We can beat 'em fair and square. We play all out!"
answered Astro.</p>

<p>Roger didn't say anything. He moved to one side and
took his position for the dash down field.</p>

<p>The whistle blew again and the crowd roared as the
two teams charged toward the ball. The cadets were
eager to see if the <i>Arcturus</i> crew could tie the score or
if the crew of the <i>Polaris</i> would increase its lead. But
after a few moments of play, their cries of encouragement
subsided into rumbles of discontent. In its eagerness
to score, the <i>Arcturus</i> unit kept making errors and
lost the ball constantly but the crew of the <i>Polaris</i>
failed to capitalize. The second period ended with the
score unchanged.</p>

<p>As he slumped to the ground for the rest period,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>Astro turned on Roger bitterly. "What's the idea, Manning?
You're dogging it!"</p>

<p>"You play your game, Astro," replied Roger calmly,
"I'll play mine."</p>

<p>"We're playing this game as a team, Roger," chimed
in Tom heatedly. "You're kicking the ball all over the
lot!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," added Astro. "In every direction except the
goal!"</p>

<p>"I was never clear," defended Roger. "I didn't want
to lose possession of the ball!"</p>

<p>"You sure didn't," said Tom. "You acted as if it was
your best friend and you never wanted to be separated
from it!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/im103.png" width="400" height="330" alt="im103" title="" /></div>

<p>"We said we didn't want to freeze this game, Roger,
and we meant it!" Astro glowered at his unit-mate.
"Next period you show us some action! If you don't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
want to score, feed it to us and we'll save you the trouble!"</p>

<p>But the third period was the same. While Tom and
Astro dashed up and down the field, blocking out the
members of the <i>Arcturus</i> crew to give Roger a clear
shot, he simply nudged the ball back and forth between
the side lines, ignoring his teammates' pleas to drive
forward. As the whistle sounded for the end of the period,
boos and catcalls from the grandstand filled the
air.</p>

<p>Tom's face was an angry red as he faced Roger again
on the side lines during the rest period.</p>

<p>"You hear that, Roger?" he growled, nodding his
head toward the stands. "That's what they think of your
smart playing!"</p>

<p>"What do I care?" replied the blond cadet arrogantly.
"They're not playing this game! I am!"</p>

<p>"And we are too!" Astro's voice was a low rumble as
he came up behind Manning. "If you don't give us a
chance, so help me, I'll use your head for a ball!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/im104.png" width="400" height="319" alt="im104" title="" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you're so interested in scoring, why don't you go
after the ball yourselves then?" said Roger.</p>

<p>"Because we're too busy trying to be a team!" snapped
Tom. "We're trying to clear shots for you!"</p>

<p>"Don't be so generous," sneered Roger.</p>

<p>"I'm warning you, Roger"&mdash;Astro glared at the arrogant
cadet&mdash;"if you don't straighten out and fly right&mdash;"</p>

<p>McKenny's whistle from the far side lines suddenly
sounded, interrupting the big cadet, and the three boys
trooped back out on the field again. Again the air was
filled with boos and shouts of derision and Tom's face
flushed with shame.</p>

<p>This time, when McKenny's hand flashed downward,
Tom streaked for the ball, instead of Schohari, his usual
opponent. He measured his stride carefully and
reached the ball in perfect kicking position.</p>

<p>He felt the satisfying thud against his foot, and saw
the ball shoot out high in front of him and head for the
goal line. It was a beautiful kick. But then, the ball suddenly
sank, its flight altered by the action of the mercury.
Running down field, Tom saw Swift and Allen
meet the ball together. Allen blocked it with his chest
and caromed it over to Swift. Swift let the ball drop to
the ground, drawing his foot back to kick. But again,
the mercury changed the ball's action, twisting it to one
side and Swift's kick caught it on the side. Instead of
the ball going down field, it veered to the left, in the
path of Astro. Quickly getting his head under it, he
shifted it to Roger, who streaked in and stopped it with
his hip. But then, instead of passing ahead to Tom, who
by now was down field and in the open, Roger prepared
to kick for the goal himself.</p>

<p>Tom shouted a warning but it was too late. Schohari
came rushing in behind him, and at running stride, met
the ball squarely with his right foot. It sailed high in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>the air and over the <i>Polaris</i> goal line just as the whistle
blew. The game was tied.</p>

<p>"That was some play, Manning," said Astro, when
they were lined up waiting for the next period to begin.</p>

<p>"You asked for it," snapped Roger, "you were yapping
at me to play, and now look what's happened!"</p>

<p>"Listen, you loudmouthed punk!" said Astro, advancing
toward the smaller cadet, but just then the
whistle blew and the three boys ran out onto the field.</p>

<p>The <i>Arcturus</i> crew swept down the field quickly,
heading for the ball and seemingly ignoring the <i>Polaris</i>
unit. But Schohari slipped and fell on the grass which
gave Tom a clear shot at the ball. He caught it with the
side of his boot and passed it toward Roger. But Allen,
at full speed, came in and intercepted, sending the ball
in a crazy succession of twists, turns and bounces. The
crowd came to its feet as all six cadets made desperate
attempts to clear the skittering ball with none of them
so much as touching it. This was the part of mercuryball
that pleased the spectator. Finally, Schohari managed
to get a toe on it and he sent it down field, but
Astro had moved out to play defense. He stopped the
ball on his shoulder and dropped it to the ground.
Steadying it there, he waited until Tom was in the clear
and kicked it forty yards to the mid-field stripe.</p>

<p>The crowd came to its feet, sensing this final drive
might mean victory for the <i>Polaris</i> crew. The boys of
the <i>Arcturus</i> swarmed in&mdash;trying to keep Tom from
scoring. With a tremendous burst of speed, Tom
reached the ball ahead of Schohari, and with the
strength of desperation, he slammed his foot against it.
The whistle blew ending the game as the ball rose in an
arc down the field and fell short of the goal by ten feet.
There was a groan from the crowd.</p>

<p>But suddenly the ball, still reacting to the mercury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>inside, spun like a top, rolled sideways, and as if it were
being blown by a breeze, rolled toward the goal line
and stopped six inches inside the white chalk line.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause as the crowd and
the players, stunned by the play, grasped what
had happened. Then swelling into a roar, there was
one word chanted over and over&mdash;"<i>Polaris&mdash;Polaris&mdash;Polaris</i>...."</p>

<p>The <i>Polaris</i> unit had reached the finals of the Academy
tournament.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>During the intermission Charlie Wolcheck, unit commander
of the <i>Capella</i> crew, walked over to the refreshment
unit behind the grandstand where Steve Strong,
Dr. Dale and Commander Walters were drinking Martian
water and eating spaceburgers.</p>

<p>"Afternoon, Commander," saluted Wolcheck. "Hello,
Joan, Steve. Looks as though your boys on the <i>Polaris</i>
are going to meet their match this afternoon. I've got to
admit they're good, but with Tony Richards feeding
passes to Al Davison and with the blocking of Scott
McAvoy&mdash;" The young officer broke off with a grin.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Charlie," Commander Walters said
with a wink to Dr. Dale. "From the looks of Cadet
Astro, if he ever gets his foot on the ball, your <i>Capella</i>
unit will have to go after it with a jet boat."</p>

<p>"Why, Commander," replied Wolcheck, laughing
good-naturedly, "Tony Richards is one of the finest
booters I've ever seen. Saw him make a goal from the
sixty-yard line from a standstill."</p>

<p>Steve Strong waved a Martian water pop bottle at
young Wolcheck in a gesture of friendly derision.</p>

<p>"Did you happen to see the play in the first period?"
he boasted. "Manning took a perfect pass from Astro
and scored. You're finished, Wolcheck, you and your
<i>Capella</i> unit won't even come close.
"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"From what I hear and see, Manning seems to be a
little sore that he can't make all the scores himself,"
grinned Wolcheck slyly. "He wants to be the whole
show!"</p>

<p>Strong reddened and turned to put the empty bottle
on the counter, using it as an excuse to hide his feelings
from the commander and Joan. So Wolcheck had
observed Manning's attitude and play on the field too.</p>

<p>Before Strong could reply, a bugle sounded from the
field and the group of Solar Guard officers returned to
their seats for the final game of the tournament between
the <i>Capella</i> and the <i>Polaris</i> units.</p>

<p>Out on the field Mike made his usual speech about
playing fair and gave the cadets the routine instructions
of the game, reminding them that they were spacemen
first, unit-members second, and individuals third and
last. The six boys shook hands and jogged down the field
to take up their positions.</p>

<p>"How about concentrating on the passes Richards is
going to feed to Davison," Tom asked his unit-mates.
"Never mind blocking out Richards and McAvoy."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Astro, "play for the ball. Sounds good
to me."</p>

<p>"How about it, Roger?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Just play the game," said Roger. And then added
sarcastically, "And don't forget to give them every
chance to score. Let's play fair and square, the way we
did with the <i>Arcturus</i> unit."</p>

<p>"If you feel that way, Manning," answered Astro
coldly, "you can quit right now! We'll handle the <i>Capella</i>
guys ourselves!"</p>

<p>Before Roger could answer, McKenny blew the
ready whistle and the three boys lined up along the
white chalk line preparing for the dash to the waiting
ball.</p>

<p>The cadets in the stands were hushed. McKenny's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>hand swept up and then quickly down as he blew the
whistle. The crowd came to its feet, roaring, as Tom,
five steps from his own goal line, tripped and fell headlong
to the grass, putting him out of the first play. Astro
and Roger charged down the field, with Astro
reaching the ball first. He managed a good kick, but
Richards, three feet away, took the ball squarely on his
chest. The mercuryball fell to the ground, spun in a
dizzy circle and with a gentle tap by Richards, rolled
to Davison, who took it in stride and sent it soaring for
a forty-five-yard goal.</p>

<p>The <i>Capella</i> unit had drawn first blood.</p>

<p>"Well, hot-shot," snarled Roger back on the starting
line, "what happened to the big pass-stealing idea?"</p>

<p>"I tripped, Manning," said Tom through clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>"Yeah! Tripped!" sneered Roger.</p>

<p>The whistle blew for the next goal.</p>

<p>Tom, with an amazing burst of speed, swept down the
field, broke stride to bring him in perfect line with
the ball and with a kick that seemed almost lazy, sent
the ball from a dead standstill, fifty yards over the <i>Capella</i>
goal before any of the remaining players were
within five feet of it, and the score was tied.</p>

<p>The crowd sprang to its feet again and roared his
name.</p>

<p>"That was terrific!" said Astro, slapping Tom on the
back as they lined up again. "It looked as though you
hardly kicked that ball at all."</p>

<p>"Yeah," muttered Roger, "you really made yourself
the grandstand's delight!"</p>

<p>"What's that supposed to mean, Manning?" asked
Astro.</p>

<p>"Superman Corbett probably burned himself out!
Let's see him keep up that speed for the next ten minutes!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The whistle blew for the next goal, and again the
three boys moved forward to meet the onrushing <i>Capella</i>
unit.</p>

<p>Richards blocked Astro with a twist of his body, and
without stopping his forward motion, kicked the ball
squarely toward the goal. It stopped ten feet short, took
a dizzying spin and rolled away from the goal line. In a
flash, the six boys were around the ball, blocking, shoving,
and yelling instructions to each other while at the
same time kicking at the unsteady ball. With each
grazing kick, the ball went into even more maddening
spins and gyrations.</p>

<p>At last Richards caught it with the side of his foot,
flipped it to McAvoy who dropped back, and with
twenty feet between him and the nearest <i>Polaris</i> member,
calmly booted it over the goal. The whistle blew
ending the first period, and the <i>Capella</i> unit led two to
one.</p>

<p>During the next three periods, the <i>Capella</i> unit
worked like a well-oiled machine. Richards passed to
Davison or McAvoy, and when they were too well
guarded, played brilliantly alone. The <i>Polaris</i> unit, on
the other hand, appeared to be hopelessly outclassed.
Tom and Astro fought like demons but Roger's lack of
interest gave the <i>Capella</i> unit the edge in play. At the
end of the fourth period, the <i>Capella</i> team led by three
points, seven to four.</p>

<p>While the boys rested before the fifth and final period,
Captain Strong, having watched the play with
keen interest, realized that Roger was not playing up to
his fullest capabilities. Suddenly he summoned a
near-by Earthworm cadet, scribbled a message on a slip
of paper and instructed the cadet to take it directly to
Roger.</p>

<p>"Orders from the coach on the side lines?" asked Wolcheck
as he noticed Strong's action.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might call it that, Charlie," answered Steve
blandly.</p>

<p>On the field, the cadet messenger handed Roger the
slip of paper, not mentioning that it was from Strong,
and hurried back to the stands.</p>

<p>"Getting fan mail already?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>Roger ignored the comment and opened the slip of
paper to read:</p>

<p>" ... It might interest you to know that the winning
team of the mercuryball finals is to be awarded a first
prize of three days' liberty in Atom City...." There
was no signature.</p>

<p>Roger stared up into the stands and searched vainly
for some indication of the person who might have sent
him the note. The crowd hushed as McKenny stepped
forward for the starting of the last period.</p>

<p>"What was in the note, Roger?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"The winning combination," smiled Roger lazily.
"Get set for the fastest game of mercuryball you've ever
played, Corbett! We've got to pull this mess out of the
fire!"</p>

<p>Bewildered, Tom looked at Astro who merely
shrugged his shoulders and took his place ready for the
whistle. Roger tucked the note into his shorts and
stepped up to the line.</p>

<p>"Listen, Corbett," said Roger, "every time Richards
gets the ball, he kicks it to his left, and then McAvoy
feints as if to get it, leaving Davison in the open. When
you go to block Davison, you leave Richards in the
clear. He just keeps the ball. He's scored three times
that way!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Tom, "I noticed that, but there was
nothing I could do about it, the way you've been playing."</p>

<p>"Kinda late in the game for any new ideas, Manning,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>growled Astro. "Just get the ball and pass it
to me."</p>

<p>"That's my whole idea! Play back, Astro. Move like
you're very tired, see? Then they'll forget about you
and play three on two. You just be ready to kick and
kick hard!"</p>

<p>"What's happened to you, Roger?" asked Tom. "What
was in that note?"</p>

<p>Before Roger could answer, the whistle and the roar
from the crowd signaled the beginning of the last period.
The cadets raced down the field, Roger swerving
to the left and making a feint at blocking Richards. He
missed intentionally and allowed Richards to get the
ball, who immediately passed to the left. McAvoy raced
in on the ball, Tom made a move as if to block him, reversed,
and startled the onrushing Richards with a perfect
block. The ball was in the clear. Roger gave it a
half kick and the ball landed two feet in front of Astro.
The big cadet caught it perfectly on the first bounce
and kicked it on a line across the goal, seventy yards
away.</p>

<p>Up in the stands, Steve Strong smiled as he watched
the score change on the board: "<i>Capella</i> seven&mdash;<i>Polaris</i>
five!"</p>

<p>In rapid succession, the <i>Polaris</i> unit succeeded in intercepting
the play of the <i>Capella</i> unit and rolling up
two goals to an even score. Now, there were only fifty-five
seconds left to play.</p>

<p>The cadets in the stands roared their approval of the
gallant effort made by the three members of the <i>Polaris</i>
crew. It had been a long time since mercuryball had
been played with such deadly accuracy at Space Academy
and everyone who attended the game was to remember
for years to come the last play of the game.</p>

<p>McKenny blew the whistle again and the boys
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>charged forward, but by now, aware of the sudden flash
of unity on the part of the opposing team, the <i>Capella</i>
unit fought desperately to salvage at least a tie.</p>

<p>Tom managed to block a kick by Richards, and the
ball took a dizzy hop to the left, landing in front of Astro.
He was in the clear. The stands were in an uproar
as the cadets saw that the game was nearly over. Astro
paused a split second, judged the ball and stepped forward
to kick. But the ball spun away, just as Astro
swung his leg. And at that instant, McAvoy came
charging in from the left, only to be blocked by Roger.
But the force of McAvoy's charge knocked Roger back
into Astro. Instead of kicking the ball, Astro caught
Roger on the side of the head. Roger fell to the ground
and lay still. He was knocked cold. Astro lost his balance,
twisted on one leg unsteadily, and then fell to the
ground. When he tried to get up, he couldn't walk. He
had twisted his ankle.</p>

<p>The <i>Capella</i> unit members stood still, confused and
momentarily unable to take advantage of their opportunity.
Without a moment's hesitation, Tom swept in and
kicked the ball before his opponents realized what had
happened. The ball drifted up in a high arc and landed
with several bounces, stopping five feet from the goal.</p>

<p>Suddenly Richards, McAvoy and Davison came alive
and charged after Tom, who was running for the ball as
fast as his weary legs would carry him. He saw Richards
pull up alongside of him, then pass him. Then Davison
and McAvoy closed in on either side to block and
give Richards a clear shot back down the field and a
certain score.</p>

<p>Richards reached the ball, stopped and carefully
lined up his kick, certain that his teammates could
block out Tom. But the young cadet, in a last desperate
spurt, outraced both McAvoy and Davison. Then, as
Richards cocked his foot to kick, Tom jumped. With a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>mighty leaping dive, he sent his body hurtling headlong
toward Richards just as he kicked. Tom's body
crashed into the ball and Richards. The two boys went
down in a heap but the ball caromed off his chest and
rolled over the goal line.</p>

<p>The whistle blew ending the game.</p>

<p>In an instant, two thousand officers, cadets and enlisted
men went wild as the ball rolled across the goal
line.</p>

<p>The <i>Polaris</i> crew had won eight goals to seven!</p>

<p>From every corner of the field, the crowd cheered
the cadets who had finished the game, had won it in
the final seconds with two of them sprawled on the
field unconscious and a third unable to stand on his
feet.</p>

<p>Up in the stands, Captain Strong turned to Commander
Walters. He found it hard to keep his eyes from
filling up as he saluted briskly.</p>

<p>"Captain Strong reporting, sir, on the success of the
<i>Polaris</i> unit to overcome their differences and become
a fighting unit! And I mean <i>fight</i>!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_11" id="CHAPTER_11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

<p>"Atom City Express now arriving on track two!" The
voice boomed over the loud-speaker system; and as the
long, gleaming line of monorail cars eased to a stop
with a soft hissing of brakes, the three cadets of the
<i>Polaris</i> unit moved eagerly in that direction.</p>

<p>"Atom City, here we come," cried Astro.</p>

<p>"We and a lot of others with the same idea," said
Tom. And, in fact, there were only a few civilians in the
crowd pressing toward the car doors. Uniforms predominated&mdash;the
blue of the cadets, enlisted men in
scarlet, even a few in the black and gold uniforms which
identified the officers of the Solar Guard.</p>

<p>"Personally," whispered Tom to his friends, "the first
thing I want to do at Atom City is take a long walk&mdash;somewhere
where I won't see a single uniform."</p>

<p>"As for me," drawled Roger, "I'm going to find a
stereo studio where they're showing a Liddy Tamal
feature. I'll sit down in a front-row seat and just watch
that girl act for about six hours."</p>

<p>He turned to Astro. "And how about you?"</p>

<p>"Why ... why ... I'll string along with you,
Roger," said the cadet from Venus. "It's been a long
time since I've seen a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger laughed.</p>

<p>"A what?" teased Tom
.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"A&mdash;a&mdash;girl," sputtered Astro, blushing.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Roger in mock surprise. "I
never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on," interrupted Tom. "Time to get aboard."</p>

<p>They hurried across the platform and entered the
sleek car. Inside they found seats together and sank
into the luxurious chairs.</p>

<p>Astro sighed gently, stretched out his long legs and
closed his eyes blissfully for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Don't wake me till we get started," he said.</p>

<p>"We already have," returned Tom. "Take a look."</p>

<p>Astro's eyes popped open. He glanced through the
clear crystal glass at the rapidly moving landscape.</p>

<p>"These express jobs move on supercushioned ball
bearings," explained Tom. "You can't even feel it when
you pull out of the station."</p>

<p>"Blast my jets!" marveled Astro. "I'd sure like to take
a look at the power unit on this baby."</p>

<p>"Even on a vacation, all this guy can think about is
power!" grumbled Roger.</p>

<p>"How about building up our own power," suggested
Tom. "It's a long haul to Atom City. Let's get a bite to
eat."</p>

<p>"O.K. with me, spaceboy!" Astro grinned. "I could
swallow a whole steer!"</p>

<p>"That's a great idea, cadet," said a voice from behind
them.</p>

<p>It came from a gray-haired man, neatly dressed in
the black one-piece stylon suit currently in fashion, and
with a wide red sash around his waist.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," said Tom, "were you speaking
to us?"</p>

<p>"I certainly was," replied the stranger. "I'm asking
you to be my guests at dinner. And while I may not be
able to buy your friend a whole steer, I'll gladly get
him a piece of one."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hey," said Astro, "do you think he means it?"</p>

<p>"He seems to," replied Tom. He turned to the stranger.
"Thanks very much, sir, but don't think Astro was
just kidding about his appetite."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he wasn't." The gray-haired man smiled,
and came over and stretched out his hand. "Then it's a
deal," he said. "My name's Joe Bernard."</p>

<p>"Bernard!" exclaimed Roger. He paled and glanced
quickly at his two friends, but they were too busy looking
over their new friend to notice.</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, sir," said Tom. "I'm Tom Corbett.
This is Astro, from Venus. And over here is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Roger's my name," the third cadet said quickly.
"Won't you sit down, sir?"</p>

<p>"No use wasting time," said Bernard. "Let's go right
into the dining car." The cadets were in no mood to argue
with him. They picked up the small microphones
beside their chairs and sent food orders to the kitchen;
and by the time they were seated in the dining car,
their orders were ready on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernard, with a twinkle in his eye, watched them
enjoy their food. In particular, he watched Astro.</p>

<p>"I warned you, sir," whispered Tom, as the Venusian
went to work on his second steak.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have missed this for anything," said Bernard.
He smiled, lit a cigar of fine Mercurian leaf tobacco
and settled back comfortably.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "let me explain why I was so
anxious to have dinner with you. I'm in the import-export
business. Ship to Mars, mostly. But all my life
I've wanted to be a spaceman."</p>

<p>"Well, what was the trouble, Mr. Bernard?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>The man in black sighed. "Couldn't take the acceleration,
boys. Bad heart. I send out more than five hundred
cargoes a year, to all parts of the solar system; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>myself, I've never been more than a mile off the surface
of the earth."</p>

<p>"It sure must be disappointing&mdash;to want to blast off,
and know that you can't," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I tried, once," said Bernard, with a rueful smile.
"Yup! I tried." He gazed thoughtfully out the window.</p>

<p>"When I was your age, about twenty, I wanted to get
into Space Academy worse than anybody I'd ever met."
He paused. "Except for one person. A boyhood buddy
of mine&mdash;named Kenneth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," cut in Roger quickly, "but I think
we'd better get back to our car. With this big liberty in
front of us, we need a lot of rest."</p>

<p>"But, Roger!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>Bernard smiled. "I understand, Roger. Sometimes I
forget that I'm an old man. And when you've already
tasted the excitement of space travel, talk like mine
must seem rather dull." He stood up and faced the three
cadets. "It's been very pleasant, Corbett, Astro, Roger.
Now run along and get your rest. I'll just sit here for a
while and watch the scenery."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Tom, "for the dinner&mdash;your
company&mdash;and everything," he finished lamely.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of good-byes and the boys returned
to their car. But there was little conversation
now. Gradually, the lights in the cars dimmed to permit
sleep. But Tom kept listening to the subdued click of
the monorail&mdash;and kept wondering. Finally Roger,
sleeping next to him, wakened for a moment.</p>

<p>"Roger," said Tom, "I want to ask you something."</p>

<p>"Wait'll the mornin'," mumbled Roger. "Wanta
sleep."</p>

<p>"The way you acted with Bernard," Tom persisted.
"You ate his dinner and then acted like he was poison.
Why was that, Roger?"</p>

<p>The other sat bolt upright. "Listen," he said. "Listen!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>Then he slumped back in his chair and closed his
eyes. "Lemme sleep, Corbett. Lemme sleep, I tell you."
He turned his back and in a moment was making
sounds of deep slumber, but Tom felt sure that Roger
was not asleep&mdash;that he was wide awake, with something
seriously bothering him.</p>

<p>Tom leaned back and gazed out over the passing
plains and up into the deep black of space. The Moon
was full, large and round. He could distinguish <i>Mare
Imbrium</i>, the largest of Luna's flat plains visible from
Earth, where men had built the great metropolis of
Luna City. Farther out in the deep blackness, he could
see Mars, glowing like a pale ruby. Before long he
would be up there again. Before long he would be
blasting off in the <i>Polaris</i> with Astro and with Roger&mdash;</p>

<p>Roger! Why had he acted so strangely at dinner?</p>

<p>Tom remembered the night he saw Roger in Galaxy
Hall alone at night, and the sudden flash on the field a
few days before when they had won the mercuryball
game. Was there some reason behind his companion's
strange actions? In vain, Tom racked his brain to find
the answer. There had to be some explanation. Yet
what could it possibly be? He tossed and turned and
worried and finally&mdash;comfortable as the monorail car
was&mdash;he fell asleep from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Atom City! Built of the clear crystal mined so
cheaply on Titan, moon of Saturn, Atom City had risen
from a barren North American wasteland to become a
show place of the universe. Here was the center of all
space communications&mdash;a proud city of giant crystal
buildings. Here had been developed the first slidewalks,
air cars, three-dimensional stereos and hundreds of
other ideas for better living.</p>

<p>And here at Atom City was the seat of the great
Solar Alliance, housed in a structure which covered a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>quarter of a mile at its base and which towered three
thousand noble feet into the sky.</p>

<p>The three cadets stepped out of the monorail and
walked across the platform to a waiting air car&mdash;jet-powered,
shaped like a teardrop and with a clear crystal
top.</p>

<p>"We want the best hotel in town," said Astro grandly
to the driver.</p>

<p>"And get this speed bug outa here in a hurry," Roger
told him. "There's a lot we want to do."</p>

<p>The driver couldn't help smiling at the three cadets
so obviously enjoying their first leave.</p>

<p>"We've got three top hotels," he said. "One's as good
as the other. They're the Earth, the Mars and the
Venus."</p>

<p>"The Earth," voted Tom.</p>

<p>"The Mars," shouted Roger.</p>

<p>"The <i>Venus</i>!" roared Astro.</p>

<p>"All right," said the driver with a laugh, "make up
your minds."</p>

<p>"Which of 'em is nearest the center of the city?" Tom
asked.</p>

<p>"The Mars."</p>

<p>"Then blast off for Mars!" ordered Tom, and the air
car shot away from the station and moved up into the
stream of expressway traffic fifty feet above the
ground.</p>

<p>As the little car sped along the broad avenue, Tom
remembered how often, as a boy, he'd envied the Space
Cadets who'd come to his home town of New Chicago
on leave. Now here <i>he</i> was&mdash;in uniform, with a three-day
pass, and all of Atom City to enjoy it in.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the air car stopped in front of
the Mars Hotel. The cadets saw the entrance loom before
them&mdash;a huge opening, with ornate glass and crystal
in many different colors.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked across the high-ceilinged lobby toward
the desk. All around them, the columns that supported
the ceiling were made of the clearest crystal. Their feet
sank into soft, lustrous deep-pile rugs made of Venusian
jungle grass.</p>

<p>The boys advanced toward the huge circular reception
desk where a pretty girl with red hair waited to
greet them.</p>

<p>"May I help you?" she asked. She flashed a dazzling
smile.</p>

<p>"You're a lucky girl," said Roger. "It just so happens
you <i>can</i> help me. We'll have dinner together&mdash;just the
two of us&mdash;and then we'll go to the stereos. After which
we'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head sadly. "I can see your friend's
got a bad case of rocket shock," she said to Tom.</p>

<p>"That's right," Tom admitted. "But if you'll give us a
triple room, we'll make sure he doesn't disturb anybody."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Roger, "go blow your jets!"</p>

<p>"I have a nice selection of rooms here on photo-slides
if you'd care to look at them," the girl suggested.</p>

<p>"How many rooms in this hotel, Beautiful?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"Nearly two thousand," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"And you have photo-slides of all two thousand?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," answered the girl. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"You and Astro go take a walk, Corbett," said Roger
with a grin. "I'll select our quarters!"</p>

<p>"You mean," asked the girl, a little flustered, "you
want to look at all the slides?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Lovely!" said Roger with a lazy smile.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but that would take three hours!"</p>

<p>"Exactly my idea!" said Roger.</p>

<p>"Just give us a nice room, Miss," said Tom, cutting in.
"And please excuse Manning. He's so smart, he gets a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>little dizzy now and then. Have to take him over to a
corner and revive him." He glanced at Astro, who
picked Roger up in his arms and walked away with him
as though he were a baby.</p>

<p>"Come on, you space Romeo!" said Astro.</p>

<p>"Hey&mdash;ouch&mdash;hey&mdash;lemme go, ya big ape. You're
killing your best friend!" Roger twisted around in Astro's
viselike grasp, to no avail.</p>

<p>"Space fever," explained Tom. "He'll be O.K. soon."</p>

<p>"I think I understand," said the girl with a nervous
smile.</p>

<p>She handed Tom a small flashlight. "Here's your
photoelectric light key for room 2305 F. That's on the
two hundred thirtieth floor."</p>

<p>Tom took the light key and turned toward the slidestairs
where Astro was holding Roger firmly, despite his
frantic squirming.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom," cried Roger, "tell this Venusian ape to
let me go!"</p>

<p>"Promise to behave yourself?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"We came here to have fun, didn't we?" demanded
Roger.</p>

<p>"That doesn't mean getting thrown out of the hotel
because you've got to make passes at every beautiful
girl."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with beautiful girls?" growled
Roger. "They're official equipment, like a radar scanner.
You can't get along without them!"</p>

<p>Tom and Astro looked at each other and burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>"Come on, you jerk," said Astro, "let's get washed
up. I wanta take a walk and get something to eat. I'm
hungry again!"</p>

<p>An hour later, showered and dressed in fresh uniforms,
the <i>Polaris</i> crew began a tour of the city. They
went to the zoo and saw dinosaurs, a tyrannosaurus,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>and many other monsters extinct on Earth millions of
years ago, but still breeding in the jungles of Tara.
They visited the council chamber of the Solar Alliance
where delegates from the major planets and from the
larger satellites, such as Titan of Saturn, Ganymede
of Jupiter, and Luna of Earth made the laws for the
tri-planetary league. The boys walked through the long
halls of the Alliance building, looking at the great documents
which had unified the solar system.</p>

<p>They reverently inspected original documents of the
Universal Bill of Rights and the Solar Constitution,
which guaranteed basic freedoms of speech, press, religion,
peaceful assembly and representative government.
And even brash, irrepressible Roger Manning
was awestruck as they tiptoed into the great Chamber
of the Galactic Court, where the supreme judicial
body of the entire universe sat in solemn dignity.</p>

<p>Later, the boys visited the Plaza de Olympia&mdash;a huge
fountain, filled with water taken from the Martian
Canals, the lakes of Venus and the oceans of Earth,
and ringed by a hundred large statues, each one
symbolizing a step in mankind's march through
space.</p>

<p>But then, for the Space Cadets, came the greatest
thrill of all&mdash;a trip through the mighty Hall of Science,
at once a museum of past progress and a laboratory for
the development of future wonders.</p>

<p>Thousands of experiments were being conducted
within this crystal palace, and as Space Cadets, the
boys were allowed to witness a few of them. They
watched a project which sought to harness the solar
rays more effectively; another which aimed to create a
new type of fertilizer for Mars, so people of that planet
would be able to grow their own food in their arid
deserts instead of importing it all from other worlds.
Other scientists were trying to adapt Venusian jungle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>plants to grow on other planets with a low oxygen supply;
while still others, in the medical field, sought for a
universal antibody to combat all diseases.</p>

<p>Evening finally came and with it time for fun and
entertainment. Tired and leg weary, the cadets stepped
on a slidewalk and allowed themselves to be carried to
a huge restaurant in the heart of Atom City.</p>

<p>"Food," exulted Astro as the crystal doors swung
open before them. "Smell it! Real, honest-to-gosh
food!" He rushed for a table.</p>

<p>"Hold it, Astro," shouted Tom. "Take it easy."</p>

<p>"Yeah," added Roger. "It's been five hours since
your last meal&mdash;not five weeks!"</p>

<p>"Meal!" snorted the Venusian cadet. "Call four
spaceburgers a meal? And anyway, it's been six hours,
not five."</p>

<p>Laughing, Tom and Roger followed their friend inside.
Luckily, they found a table not far from the door,
where Astro grabbed the microphone and ordered his
usual tremendous dinner.</p>

<p>The three boys ate hungrily as course after course
appeared on the middle of the table, via the direct
shaft from the kitchen. So absorbed was Manning that
he did not notice the approach of a tall dark young
man of about his own age, dressed in the red-brown
uniform of the Passenger Space Service. But the young
man, who wore a captain's high-billed hat, suddenly
caught sight of Roger.</p>

<p>"Manning," he called, "what brings you here?"</p>

<p>"Al James!" cried Roger and quickly got up to shake
hands. "Of all the guys in the universe to show up! Sit
down and have a bite with us."</p>

<p>The space skipper sat down. Roger introduced him
to Tom and Astro. There was a round of small talk.</p>

<p>"Whatever made you become a Space Cadet, Roger?"
asked James finally.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you know how it is," said Roger. "You can get
used to anything."</p>

<p>Astro almost choked on a mouthful of food. He shot
a glance at Tom, who shook his head as though warning
him not to speak.</p>

<p>James grinned broadly. "I remember how you used
to talk back home. The Space Cadets were a bunch of
tin soldiers trying to feel important. The Academy was
a lot of space gas. I guess, now, you've changed your
mind."</p>

<p>"Maybe I have," said Roger. He glanced uneasily
at his two friends, but they pretended to be busy eating.
"Maybe I have." Roger's eyes narrowed, his voice
became a lazy drawl. "At that it's better'n being a man
in a monkey suit, with nothing to do but impress the
passengers and order around the crew."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said James. "What kind of a crack
is that?"</p>

<p>"No crack at all. Just the way I feel about you passenger
gents who don't know a rocket tube from a ray-gun
nozzle."</p>

<p>"Look, Manning," returned James. "No need to get
sore, just because you couldn't do any better than the
Space Cadets."</p>

<p>"Blast off," shouted Roger, "before I fuse your jets."</p>

<p>Tom spoke up. "I think you'd better go, Captain."</p>

<p>"I've got six men outside," sneered the other. "I'll
go when I'm ready."</p>

<p>"You're ready now," spoke up Astro. He stood up to
his full height. "We don't want any trouble," the cadet
from Venus said, "but we're not braking our jets to get
away from it, either."</p>

<p>James took a good look at Astro's powerful frame.
Without another word he walked away.</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. "That pal of yours is a real
Space Cadet fan, isn't he, Roger?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yeah," said Astro. "Just like Manning is himself."</p>

<p>"Look," said Roger. "Look, you guys&mdash;" He hesitated,
as though intending to say something more, but then
he turned back to his dinner. "Go on&mdash;finish your
food," he growled. He bent over his plate and ate without
lifting his eyes. And not another word was spoken
at the table until a young man approached, carrying a
portable teleceiver screen.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said. "Is one of you Cadet Tom
Corbett?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I am," acknowledged Tom.</p>

<p>"There's a call for you. Seems they've been trying
to reach you all over Atom City." He placed the teleceiver
screen on the table, plugged it into a floor socket
and set the dials.</p>

<p>"Hope's there's nothing wrong at home," said Tom to
his friends. "My last letter from Mom said Billy was
messing around with a portable atom reactor and she
was afraid he might blow himself up."</p>

<p>A picture began to take shape on the screen.
"Migosh," said Astro. "It's Captain Strong."</p>

<p>"It certainly is," said the captain's image. "Having
dinner, eh, boys? Ummmm&mdash;those baked shrimps look
good."</p>

<p>"They're terrific," said Astro. "Wish you were here."</p>

<p>"Wish you could stay there," said Captain Strong.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" moaned Astro. "Don't tell me!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, boys," came the voice from the teleceiver.
"But that's it. You've got to return to the Academy
immediately. The whole cadet corps has been ordered
into space for special maneuvers. We blast off tomorrow
morning at six hundred."</p>

<p>"But, sir," objected Tom, "we can't get a monorail
until morning!"</p>

<p>"This is an official order, Corbett. So you have priority
over all civilian transportation." The Solar Guard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>captain smiled. "I've tied up a whole bank of teleceivers
in Atom City searching for you. Get back to Space
Academy fast&mdash;commandeer an air car if you must, but
be here by six hundred hours!" The captain waved a
cheery good-bye and the screen went dark.</p>

<p>"Space maneuvers," breathed Astro. "The real
thing."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Tom. "Here we go!"</p>

<p>"Our first hop into deep space!" said Roger. "Let's
get out of here!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_12" id="CHAPTER_12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

<p>"The following ships in Squadron A will blast off immediately,"
roared Commander Walters over the teleceiver.
He looked up alertly from a chart before him
in the Academy spaceport control tower. He began to
name the ships. "<i>Capella</i>, orbital tangent&mdash;09834, <i>Arcturus</i>,
orbital tangent&mdash;09835, <i>Centauri</i>, orbital tangent&mdash;09836,
<i>Polaris</i>, orbital tangent&mdash;09837!"</p>

<p>Aboard the space cruiser <i>Polaris</i>, Tom Corbett
turned away from the control board. "That's us, sir,"
he said to Captain Strong.</p>

<p>"Very well, Corbett." The Solar Guard captain
walked to the ship's intercom and flipped on the switch.</p>

<p>"Astro, Roger, stand by!"</p>

<p>Astro and Roger reported in. Strong began to speak.
"The cadet corps has been divided into squadrons of
four ships each. We are command ship of Squadron A.
When we reach free-fall space, we are to proceed as a
group until eight hundred hours, when we are to open
sealed orders. Each of the other seven squadrons will
open their orders at the same time. Two of the squadrons
will then act as invaders while the remaining six
will be the defending fleet. It will be the invaders' job to
reach their objective and the defenders' job to stop
them."</p>

<p>"Spaceport control to rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>, your orbit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>has been cleared for blast-off...." The voice of
Commander Walters interrupted Strong in his instructions
and he turned back to Tom.</p>

<p>"Take over, Corbett."</p>

<p>Tom turned to the teleceiver. "Rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>
to spaceport control."</p>

<p>" ... Blast off minus two&mdash;six hundred forty-eight...."</p>

<p>"I read you clear," said Tom. He clicked off the teleceiver
and turned back to the intercom. "Stand by to
raise ship! Control deck to radar deck. Do we have
clear trajectory forward and up, Roger?"</p>

<p>"All clear forward and up," replied Roger.</p>

<p>"Control deck to power deck ... energize the cooling
pumps!"</p>

<p>"Cooling pumps, aye," came from Astro.</p>

<p>The giant ship began to shudder as the mighty
pumps on the power deck started their build.</p>

<p>Tom strapped himself into the pilot's seat and began
checking the dials in front of him. Satisfied, he fastened
his eyes on the sweep hand of the time clock. Above
his head, the teleceiver screen brought him a clear
picture of the Academy spaceport. He watched the
giant cruisers take to the air one by one and rocket into
the vastness of space.</p>

<p>The clock hand reached the ten-second mark.</p>

<p>"Stand by to raise ship!" Tom called into the intercom.
The red hand moved steadily, inexorably. Tom
reached for the master switch.</p>

<p>"Blast off minus&mdash;five&mdash;four&mdash;three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;<i>zero</i>!"</p>

<p>Tom threw the switch.</p>

<p>The great ship hovered above the ground for a few
moments. Then it heaved itself skyward, faster and
ever faster, pushing the Earthmen deep into their acceleration
cushions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Reaching free-fall space, Tom flipped on the artificial-gravity
generator. He felt its pull on his body, quickly
checked all the instruments and turned to Captain
Strong.</p>

<p>"Ship space-borne at six hundred fifty-three, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, Corbett," replied Strong. "Check in with
the <i>Arcturus</i>, <i>Capella</i> and the <i>Centauri</i>, form up on
one another and assume a course that will bring you
back over Academy spaceport at eight hundred hours,
when we will open orders."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom, turning back eagerly to the control
board.</p>

<p>For nearly two hours the four rocket ships of Squadron
A moved through space in a perfect arc, shaping
up for the 0800 deadline. Strong made use of the time
to check a new astrogation prism perfected by Dr.
Dale for use at hyperspace speeds. Tom rechecked his
instruments, then prepared hot tea and sandwiches in
the galley for his shipmates.</p>

<p>"This is what I call service," said Astro. He stood
stripped to the waist, a wide leather belt studded with
assorted wrenches of various shapes and sizes strapped
around his hips. In one hand he carried a wad of waste
cotton with which he continually polished the surfaces
of the atomic motors, while his eyes constantly
searched the many gauges in front of him for the slightest
sign of engine failure.</p>

<p>"Never mind bringing anything up to Manning. I'll
eat his share."</p>

<p>Astro had deliberately turned the intercom on so
Roger on the radar deck might hear. The response from
that corner was immediate and emphatic.</p>

<p>"Listen, you rocket-headed grease monkey," yelled
Roger. "If you so much as smell that grub, I'll come
down and feed you into the reactant chamber!"</p>

<p>Tom smiled at Astro and turned to the ladder leading
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>up from the power deck. Passing through the control
deck on the way to the radar bridge, he glanced at the
clock. It was ten minutes to eight.</p>

<p>"Only one thing I'm worried about, Corbett," said
Roger through a mouthful of sandwich.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Collision!" said Roger. "Some of these space-happy
cadets might get excited, and I for one don't want to
wind up as a flash in Earth's atmosphere!"</p>

<p>"Why, you have radar, to see anything that goes on."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," said Roger, "I can keep this wagon outa
their way, but will they stay outa mine? Why my
father told me once&mdash;" Roger choked on his food and
turned away to the radar screen.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom after a moment, "what <i>did</i> your
father tell you?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;nothing&mdash;not important. But I've got to get a
cross-fix on Regulus before we start our little games."</p>

<p>Tom looked puzzled. Here was another of Roger's
quick changes of attitude. What was it all about? But
there was work to do, so Tom shrugged his shoulders
and returned to the control deck. He couldn't forget
what Roger had said about a collision, though.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Captain," said Tom, "but have there
been any serious collisions in space between ships?"</p>

<p>"Sure have, Tom," replied Strong. "About twenty
years ago, maybe less, there was a whole wave of them.
That was before we developed superrebound pulse
radar. The ships were faster than the radar at close
range."</p>

<p>Strong paused. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>Before Tom could answer, there was a sharp warning
from the captain.</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock, Corbett!"</p>

<p>Tom ripped open the envelope containing the sealed
orders. "Congratulations," he read. "You are in command
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>of the defenders. You have under your command,
Squadrons A&mdash;B&mdash;C&mdash;D&mdash;E&mdash;F. Squadrons G and H are
your enemies, and at this moment are on their way to
attack Luna City. It is your job to protect it and destroy
the enemy fleet. Spaceman's luck! Walters, Commander
Space Academy, Senior Officer Solar Guard."</p>

<p>"Roger," yelled Tom, "we've been selected as flagship
for the defenders! Get me a course to Luna City!"</p>

<p>"Good for us, spaceboy. I'll give you that course in a
jiffy!"</p>

<p>" ... <i>Capella</i> to <i>Polaris</i>&mdash;am standing by for your
orders...." Tony Richards' voice crackled over the
teleceiver. One by one the twenty-three ships that
made up the defender's fleet checked in for orders.</p>

<p>"Astro," shouted Tom, "stand by for maneuver&mdash;and
be prepared to give me every ounce of thrust you can
get!"</p>

<p>"Ready, willing and able, Tom," replied Astro. "Just
be sure those other space jockeys can keep up with me,
that's all!"</p>

<p>Tom turned to Captain Strong.</p>

<p>"What do you think of approaching&mdash;"</p>

<p>Strong cut him off. "Corbett, you are in complete
command. Take over&mdash;you're losing time talking
to me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Tom. He turned back to the control
board, his face flushed with excitement. Twenty-four
ships to maneuver and the responsibility all his own.
Via a chart projected on a screen, he studied various
approaches to the Moon and Luna City. What would
he do if he were in command of the invading fleet? He
noticed the Moon was nearing a point where it would
be in eclipse on Luna City itself. He studied the chart
further, made several notations and turned to the teleceiver.</p>

<p>"Attention&mdash;attention&mdash;flagship <i>Polaris</i> to Squadrons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
B and C&mdash;proceed to chart seven&mdash;sectors eight and
nine. You will patrol those sectors. Attention Squadrons
D and F&mdash;proceed to Luna City at emergency space
speed, hover at one hundred thousand feet above Luna
City spaceport and wait for further orders. Attention,
ships three and four of Squadron F&mdash;you will proceed
to chart six&mdash;sectors sixty-eight through seventy-five.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/im133.png" width="395" height="480" alt="&quot;Attention Squadrons D and F&mdash;proceed to Luna City&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Attention Squadrons D and F&mdash;proceed to Luna City&quot;</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut all rockets and remain there until further orders.
The remainder of Squadron F&mdash;ships one and two&mdash;will
join Squadron A. Squadron A will stand by for
further orders." Tom glanced at the clock and punched
the intercom button.</p>

<p>"Have you got that course, Roger?"</p>

<p>"Three degrees on the starboard rockets, seventy-eight
degrees on the up-plane of the ecliptic will put
you at the corner of Luna Drive and Moonset Land in
the heart of Luna City, spaceboy!" answered Roger.</p>

<p>"Get that, Astro?" asked Tom on the intercom.</p>

<p>"All set," replied Astro.</p>

<p>"Attention all ships in Squadron A&mdash;this is flagship&mdash;code
name Starlight&mdash;am changing course. Stand by
to form up on me!"</p>

<p>Tom turned back to the intercom.</p>

<p>"Power deck, execute!"</p>

<p>At more than five thousand miles an hour, the <i>Polaris</i>
hurtled toward its destination. One by one the remaining
ships moved alongside until all six had their needlelike
noses pointed toward the pale satellite of the
Moon.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what your plans are, Tom," said
Strong, when the long haul toward the Moon had settled
down to a routine. "Just idle curiosity, nothing
more. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to."</p>

<p>"Golly, yes," said Tom, "I'd be very grateful for your
opinion."</p>

<p>"Well, let's have it," said the captain. "But as for my
opinion&mdash;I'll listen, but I won't say anything."</p>

<p>Tom grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Well," he began, "if I were in command of the invading
fleet, I would strike in force&mdash;I'd have to, to do
damage with only eight ships. There are three possible
approaches to Luna City. One is from the Earth side,
using the eclipse corridor of darkness as protection. To
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>meet that, I've stationed two ships at different levels
and distances in that corridor so that it would be impossible
for an invasion to pass unnoticed."</p>

<p>"You mean, you'd be willing to give up two ships to
the invader to have him betray his position. Is that
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I've also sent Squadrons B and C to
sectors eight and nine on chart seven. So I have a roving
squadron to go to their aid, should the invader
strike there. And on the other hand, should he manage
to get through my outer defense, I have Squadrons D
and E over Luna City itself as an inner defense. As for
Squadron A, we'll try to engage the enemy first and
maybe weaken him; at least reduce the full force of his
attack. And then have Squadrons B, C, D and E finish
him off, by attack from three different points."</p>

<p>Strong nodded silently. The young cadet was shaping
up a defensive strategy with great skill. If he could
only follow through on his plans, the invaders of Luna
City wouldn't have much chance of success&mdash;even if
willing to take heavy losses.</p>

<p>Roger's voice came on. "Got a report for you, Tom.
From command ship, Squadron B. They've sighted the
invaders and are advancing to meet them."</p>

<p>Tom checked his charts and turned to the intercom.</p>

<p>"Send them this message, Roger," he said. "From
Starlight, to command ship, Squadrons B and C&mdash;approach
enemy ships from position of chart nineteen,
sections one through ten."</p>

<p>"Right!" said Roger.</p>

<p>Strong smiled. Tom was driving his heaviest force
between the invading fleet and its objective&mdash;forcing
the aggressors into a trap.</p>

<p>Tom gave more crisp orders to his squadrons. He
asked Roger for an estimated range, and then, rechecking
his position, turned again to the intercom.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Astro, how much could you get out of this baby by
opening the by-pass between the cooling pumps and
the reactant chamber? That'd mean feeding the stuff
into the motors only half cooled."</p>

<p>Strong turned, started to speak, then clamped his
lips together.</p>

<p>"Another quarter space speed, roughly," replied
Astro, "about fifteen hundred miles more an hour. Do
you want me to do that?"</p>

<p>"No, not now," replied Tom. "Just wanted to know
what I could depend on, if I get stuck."</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Astro. "Let me know!"</p>

<p>"Why use emergency speed, Corbett?" asked Strong.
"You seem to have your enemy right where you want
him now."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom. "And the enemy knows I
have him. He can't possibly attack Luna City now. But
he can still run away. He can make his escape by this
one route."</p>

<p>Tom walked to the chart and ran his finger on a line
away from the invader's position into the asteroid belt.</p>

<p>"I don't want him to get away," Tom explained.
"And with the extra speed, we can cut him off, force
him to turn into a position where the remainder of my
fleet would finish him off."</p>

<p>"You'll do this with just the <i>Polaris</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," said Tom. "I'd use the <i>Arcturus</i>, <i>Capella</i>
and the <i>Centauri</i>, as well."</p>

<p>"Are you sure those other ships can equal your
speed?"</p>

<p>"They've got exactly the same type engines as we
have here on the <i>Polaris</i>, sir. I'm sure they could&mdash;and
with perfect safety."</p>

<p>Strong hesitated a moment, started to ask a question,
then stopped and walked to the chart screen. He
checked the figures. He checked them four times, then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
turned to Tom with a grin and an outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"I've got to offer my congratulations, Tom. This
maneuver would wipe them out. And I've got a notion
that you'd come off without the loss of a single ship,
plus, and it is a big plus, keeping the invaders more
than fifty thousand miles away from their objective!"</p>

<p>The captain turned to the teleceiver. "Rocket cruiser
<i>Polaris</i> to control tower at Space Academy&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a crackle of static and then the deep voice
of Commander Walters boomed from the speaker.</p>

<p>"Spaceport control to <i>Polaris</i>. Come in, Steve."</p>

<p>In a few brief sentences, Strong outlined Tom's plan
of action to the Academy commander. The commander's
face on the teleceiver widened into a grin,
then broke out in a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"What's that, sir?" asked Captain Strong.</p>

<p>"Very simple, Steve. All of us&mdash;all the Academy top
brass&mdash;develop a foolproof test for cadet maneuvers.
And then your young Corbett makes us look like amateurs."</p>

<p>"But didn't you expect one side or the other to win?"
asked Strong.</p>

<p>"Of course, but not like this. We've been expecting
a couple of days of maneuver, with both sides making
plenty of mistakes that we could call them on. But here
Corbett wraps the whole thing up before we can get
our pencils sharpened."</p>

<p>"Better stuff cotton in Corbett's ears before he hears
all this," rasped Roger Manning over the intercom. "Or
his head'll be too big to go through the hatch."</p>

<p>"Quiet, Manning," came Astro's voice from the
power deck. "Your mouth alone is bigger than Tom's
head'll ever be."</p>

<p>"Look, you Venusian ape&mdash;" began Roger, but Commander
Walters' voice boomed out again. His face on
the teleceiver screen was serious now.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Attention! Attention all units! The battle has been
fought and won on the chart screen of the rocket
cruiser <i>Polaris</i>. The Luna City attack has been repelled
and the invading fleet wiped out. All units and ships
will return to Space Academy at once. Congratulations
to all and end transmission."</p>

<p>The commander's face faded from the screen. Captain
Strong turned to Tom. "Good work," he said.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a crackle of static from the
teleceiver. A face suddenly appeared on the screen&mdash;a
man's face, frightened and tense.</p>

<p>"S O S." The voice rang out through the control deck.</p>

<p>"This is an S O S. Space passenger ship <i>Lady Venus</i> requests
assistance immediately. Position is sector two,
chart one hundred three. Emergency. We must
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>The screen went blank, the voice stopped as though
cut off by a knife. Strong frantically worked the teleceiver
dials to re-establish contact.</p>

<p>"<i>Polaris</i> to <i>Lady Venus</i>," he called. "Come in <i>Lady
Venus</i>. Rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i> calling <i>Lady Venus</i>.
Come in! Come in!"</p>

<p>There was no answer. The passenger ship's instruments
had gone dead.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_13" id="CHAPTER_13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

<p>"<i>Polaris</i> to Commander Walters at Space Academy&mdash;Come
in, Commander Walters!" Captain Strong's voice
was urgent in the teleceiver.</p>

<p>"Just worked up an assumed position on the <i>Lady
Venus</i>," said Roger over the intercom. "I think she's
bearing about seventeen degrees to port of us, and
about one-twenty-eight on the down-plane of the ecliptic."</p>

<p>"O.K., Roger," said Tom. "Captain Strong's trying to
reach Commander Walters now." He made a quick
mental calculation. "Golly, Roger&mdash;if you've figured it
right, we're closer to the <i>Lady Venus</i> than anyone
else!"</p>

<p>The teleceiver audio crackled.</p>

<p>"Commander Walters at Space Academy to Captain
Strong on the <i>Polaris</i>. Come in, Steve!"</p>

<p>"Commander!" Strong's voice sounded relieved. "Did
you get that emergency from the <i>Lady Venus</i>&mdash;the
S O S?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we did, Steve," said the commander. "How far
away from her are you?"</p>

<p>Without a word, Tom handed Strong the position
that Roger had computed. Strong relayed the information
to the commander.</p>

<p>"If you're that close, go to her aid in the <i>Polaris</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>You're nearer than any Solar Guard patrol ship and
you can do just as much."</p>

<p>"Right, sir," replied Steve. "I'll report as soon as I
get any news. End transmission!"</p>

<p>"Spaceman's luck, end transmission!" said the commander.</p>

<p>"Have you got a course for us, Roger?" asked Strong.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Then let's get out of here. I have a feeling there's
something more than just the usual emergency attached
to that S O S from the <i>Lady Venus</i>."</p>

<p>In twenty seconds the mighty cruiser was blasting
through space to the aid of the stricken passenger ship.</p>

<p>"Better get the emergency equipment ready, Tom,"
said Strong. "Space suits for the four of us and every
spare space suit you have on the ship. Never can tell
what we might run into. Also the first-aid surgical kit
and every spare oxygen bottle. Oh, yeah, and have
Astro get both jet boats ready to blast off immediately.
I'll keep trying to pick them up again on the teleceiver."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom sharply.</p>

<p>"What's going on up there?" asked Astro, when Tom
had relayed the orders from Captain Strong. Tom
quickly told him of the emergency signal from the
<i>Lady Venus</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Lady&mdash;Venus&mdash;</i>" said the big cadet, rolling the
name on his tongue, "I know her. She's one of the
Martian City&mdash;Venusport jobs&mdash;an old-timer. Converted
from a chemical burner to atomic reaction about three
years ago!"</p>

<p>"Any ideas what the trouble might be?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Astro. "There are a hundred
and fifty things that could go wrong&mdash;even on this
wagon and she's brand new. But I wouldn't be surprised
if it was on the power deck!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what makes you think so?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I knew a spaceman once that was on a converted
tub just like the <i>Lady Venus</i> and he had trouble with
the reaction chamber."</p>

<p>"Wow!" exclaimed Tom. "Let's hope it isn't that
now!"</p>

<p>"You can say that again," said Astro grimly. "When
this stuff gets out of control, there's very little you can
do with it, except leave it alone and pile out!"</p>

<p>The <i>Polaris</i>, rocketing through space at full space
speed, plunged like a silver bullet through the vastness
of the black void, heading for what Strong hoped to be
the <i>Lady Venus</i>. Tom prepared the emergency equipment,
doubling all the reserves on the oxygen bottles by
refilling the empties he found on the ship and making
sure that all space suits were in perfect working order.
Then he opened the emergency surgical kit and began
the laborious task of examining every vial and drug in
the kit to acquaint himself with what there was to work
with just in case. He brought all the stores of jelly out
for radiation burns and finally opened a bottle of
special sterilization liquid with which to wipe all the
instruments and vials clean. He checked the contents
of the kit once more, and, satisfied that everything was
as ready as he could make it, he went up to the control
deck.</p>

<p>"Any other message from them yet, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Nothing yet," answered Strong. "If I could pick
them up on the teleceiver, maybe they could tell us
what the trouble is and then we could more or less
be prepared to help them." He bent over the teleceiver
screen and added grimly, "If there is anything left to
help!"</p>

<p>"Radar deck to control deck!" Roger's voice was
tense. "I think I've picked them up on the radar scanner,
Captain Strong!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Relay it down here to control-deck scanner, Manning,"
ordered Strong.</p>

<p>"Ummmh!" murmured the captain when the screen
began to glow. "I'm pretty sure that's her. Here's that
assumed position Roger worked up, Tom. Check it
against this one here on the scanner."</p>

<p>Tom quickly computed the position of the object on
the scanner and compared it to the position Roger had
given them previously.</p>

<p>"If Roger's positioning was correct, sir," said Tom,
"then that's the <i>Lady Venus</i>. They both check out perfectly!"</p>

<p>Strong, bent over the radar scanner, didn't answer.
Finally he turned around and flipped off the scanner.
"That's her," he announced. "Congratulations, Roger.
You hit it right on the nose!"</p>

<p>"How shall we approach her, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"We'd better wait until she sends up her flares."</p>

<p>"You mean the identification flares for safety factors?"</p>

<p>"That's right," replied Strong. "A white flare means
it's all right to come alongside and couple air locks. A
red one means to stand off and wait for instructions."
Strong turned to the intercom.</p>

<p>"Control deck to power deck. Reduce thrust to one
quarter space speed!"</p>

<p>"Power deck, aye," answered Astro.</p>

<p>"We'll wait until we're about two miles away from
her and then use our braking jets in the bow of the ship
to bring us within a few thousand feet of her," commented
Strong.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Work up an estimated range, Roger," said Strong,
"and give me a distance on our approach."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," Roger replied. "Objective four miles
away now, sir."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"When we hit three miles," said Strong to Tom,
"have Astro stand by the forward braking jets."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Three-and-a-half miles," said Roger a few moments
later. "Closing in fast. <i>Lady Venus</i> looks like a dead
ship."</p>

<p>"That could only mean one thing," said Strong bitterly.
"There has been a power-deck failure of some
sort."</p>

<p>"Three miles to objective, sir," reported Roger. "I
think I can pick her up on the teleceiver now, but only
one way, from us to her."</p>

<p>"All right," said Strong, "see what you can do."</p>

<p>In a few moments the teleceiver screen glowed and
then the silver outline of the <i>Lady Venus</i> appeared on
the screen.</p>

<p>"I don't see any damage to her hull," said Strong half
to himself. "So if it was an explosion, it wasn't a bad
one."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom. "Shall I stand by with the flares?"</p>

<p>"Better send up a yellow identification flare, identifying
us as the Solar Guard. Let them know who we
are!"</p>

<p>Tom turned to the yellow button on his left and
pressed it. Immediately a white flash resembling a meteor
appeared on the teleceiver screen.</p>

<p>"There should be an answer soon," said Strong.</p>

<p>"Three thousand yards to objective," reported Roger.</p>

<p>"Fire braking rockets one half," ordered Strong.</p>

<p>Tom relayed the order to Astro and made the necessary
adjustments on the control panel.</p>

<p>"Stern drive rockets out," ordered Strong.</p>

<p>Once again Tom relayed the message to Astro and
turned to the control board.</p>

<p>"Cut all rockets!" ordered Strong sharply.</p>

<p>The great ship, slowed by the force of the braking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>rockets, became motionless in space a bare five hundred
yards from the <i>Lady Venus</i>.</p>

<p>"They should be sending up their safety-factor flare
soon," said Strong. "Keep trying to raise them on the
teleceiver, Roger."</p>

<p>Strong was peering through a crystal port directly at
the ship hanging dead in space opposite them. There
wasn't any sign of life. Tom stepped to the side of Steve
Strong and looked out at the crippled passenger ship.</p>

<p>"Why don't we go aboard, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"We'll wait a little longer for the flare. If we don't
get it soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There it is, sir!" shouted Tom at Strong's side.</p>

<p>From the flare port near the nose of the commercial
ship, a ball of fire streaked out.</p>

<p>"Red!" said Strong grimly, "That means we can't go
alongside. We'll have to use jet boats."</p>

<p>"Captain Strong," shouted Roger from the radar
deck, "they're signaling us with a small light from the
upper port on the starboard side!"</p>

<p>"Can you read it?" asked Strong quickly.</p>

<p>"I think so, sir. They're using standard space code,
but the light is very dim."</p>

<p>"What do they say?"</p>

<p>" ... reaction ... chamber&mdash;" said Roger slowly
as he read the blinking light, " ... radiation ... leaking
around ... baffle ... all ... safe...." Roger
stopped. "That's all, sir. I couldn't get the rest of it."</p>

<p>Strong turned to the intercom. "Astro, get the jet
boats ready to blast off immediately. Roger, send this
message. 'Am coming aboard. Stand by to receive me
on your number-one starboard jet-boat catapult deck,
signed, Strong, Captain, Solar Guard.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" replied Roger.</p>

<p>"Get into your space suit, Tom, and give Astro a
hand with the jet boats. I have to get a message back to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Space Academy and tell them to send out help right
away."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Roger," said Strong, "stand by to record this message
for the teleceiver in case Space Academy should
call our circuit while we're off the ship."</p>

<p>"All set, sir," came the reply from the radar deck.</p>

<p>"O.K.&mdash;here goes&mdash;Captain Steve Strong&mdash;Solar
Guard&mdash;am boarding passenger ship <i>Lady Venus</i>. Secondary
communications signal message received indicates
it is power-deck failure. Am taking cadets Corbett,
Manning and Astro and boarding same at"&mdash;he
paused and glanced at the clock&mdash;"thirteen hundred
fifty one hours!"</p>

<p>"That all, sir?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"That's it. Get that set on the open circuit for any
one calling us, then climb into your space suit!"</p>

<p>In a matter of minutes, the four spacemen of the
<i>Polaris</i> crew were making last-minute adjustments on
their space suits. Astro picked up his heavy belt of tools
and strapped them around his waist.</p>

<p>"What's that for, Astro?" asked Strong. "They'll have
tools aboard the ship if we need them."</p>

<p>"If that lead baffle in the reaction chamber has
worked loose, sir, the odds are ten to one that the control
chamber is flooded with radiation. And if it is, the
tools are probably so hot you couldn't use them."</p>

<p>"That's good thinking, Astro," complimented Strong.
He turned to Tom and Roger and checked their suits
and the oxygen supply and feeder valves on their
backs. He then turned his back while Tom checked his,
and Roger adjusted Astro's.</p>

<p>"All right, turn on your communicators and test
them," ordered Strong.</p>

<p>One by one the boys flipped on the switch of the portable
spacephones in their fish-bowl helmets and spoke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>to each other. Strong indicated that he was satisfied
and turned toward the jet-boat catapult deck, the three
boys following him in single file.</p>

<p>"Astro, you and Roger take number-one boat," said
Strong. "Tom and I will take number two." His voice
had a harsh metallic tone through the headset spacephones.</p>

<p>Roger hurried along with Astro to the number-one
boat and climbed inside.</p>

<p>"Jet boat has its own oxygen system," said Astro to
Roger. "Better make use of it while we're in here and
save our suits' supplies."</p>

<p>"Good idea," said Roger. He locked the clear plastic
airtight covering of the jet boat and began flicking at
the control buttons.</p>

<p>"Strap in, you Venusian hick. Here we go!" Roger
shoved a lever at his side, making the jet-boat deck airtight
from the rest of the <i>Polaris</i>, and then, by pressing a
button on the simple control board, a section of the
<i>Polaris</i>' hull slipped back, exposing them to empty
space.</p>

<p>The controls of a jet boat were simplicity itself. A
half-moon wheel for guiding, up, down and either side,
and two pedals on the floor, one for going and one for
stopping. Roger stepped on the "Go" pedal and the
small ship flashed out into the darkness of space.</p>

<p>Almost immediately on the opposite side of the <i>Polaris</i>,
Captain Strong and Tom in the second boat shot
away from the rocket cruiser and both boats headed
for the stricken spaceship.

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_14" id="CHAPTER_14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

<p>The hatch clanked shut behind them. Inside the huge
air lock of the <i>Lady Venus</i>, Tom, Roger, Astro and Captain
Strong waited for the oxygen to equal the pressure
in their space suits before removing their fish-bowl
space helmets.</p>

<p>"O.K., sir," said Tom, "pressure's equal."</p>

<p>Strong stepped to the hatch leading to the inside of
the ship and pushed hard. It slid to one side.</p>

<p>"How many jet boats do you have?" was the first
thing Strong heard as he stepped through the door to
the interior of the passenger ship.</p>

<p>"Al James!" cried Manning. "So this is your tub?"</p>

<p>The startled young skipper, whom Tom, Roger and
Astro had met in Atom City, turned to face the blond-headed
cadet.</p>

<p>"Manning!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"What's your trouble, skipper?" asked Strong of the
young spaceship captain.</p>

<p>Before James could answer there was a sudden
clamor from beyond the next hatch leading to the main
passenger cabin. Suddenly the hatch was jerked open
and a group of frightened men and women poured
through. The first to reach Strong, a short fat man with
a moonface and wearing glasses, began to jabber hysterically,
while clinging to Strong's arm.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir, this ship is going to blow up any moment.
You've got to save us!" He turned to face Al James.
"And he refused to allow us to escape in the jet boats!"
He pointed an accusing finger at the young skipper as
the other passengers loudly backed him up.</p>

<p>"Just a moment," snapped Strong. "There's a Solar
Guard rocket cruiser only five hundred yards away, so
take it easy and don't get hysterical. No one is going to
get hurt if you keep calm and obey orders!" He turned
to James. "What's the trouble, skipper?"</p>

<p>"It's the reaction chamber. The lead baffle around
the chamber worked loose and flooded everything with
radiation. Now the mass in number-three rocket is
building and wildcatting itself. If it gets any higher,
it'll explode."</p>

<p>"Why didn't your power-deck man dump the mass?"
asked Strong.</p>

<p>"We didn't know it was wildcatting until after he
had tried to repair it. And he didn't tighten the bolts
enough to keep it from leaking radiation." The young
skipper paused. "He lived long enough to warn us,
though."</p>

<p>"What's the Geiger count on the radiation?" asked
Strong.</p>

<p>"Up to twelve thirty-two&mdash;about ten minutes ago,"
answered James. "I pulled everybody out of the power
deck and cut all energy circuits, including the energizing
pumps. We didn't have any power so I had to use
the combined juice of the three jet boats to send out the
emergency signal that you picked up." He turned to
face the little man with the glasses. "I had a choice of
either saving about fifteen passengers on the jet boats,
and leaving the others, or take a chance on saving everybody
by using the power to send out a message."</p>

<p>"Ummmmh," said Strong to himself. He felt confidence
in a young spaceman who would take a decision
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>like that on himself. "What was that Geiger count
again?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Must be better than fourteen hundred by now," answered
James.</p>

<p>Strong made a quick decision.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, tight-lipped, "abandon ship! How
many passengers?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen women and twenty-three men including
the crew," replied James.</p>

<p>"Does that include yourself?" asked Strong.</p>

<p>"No," came the reply.</p>

<p>Strong felt better. Any man who would not count
himself on a list to survive could be counted on in any
emergency.</p>

<p>"We'll take four women at a time in each jet boat
first," said Strong. "James, you and I will operate the
jet boats and ferry the passengers to the <i>Polaris</i>. Tom,
you and Roger and Astro get everybody aboard the
ship ready to leave."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"We haven't much time. The reaction mass is building
fast. Come on, James, we have to rip out the seats
in the jet boats to get five people in them." Strong
turned back into the jet-boat launching well.</p>

<p>"May I have the passenger lists, Captain?" asked
Tom, turning to James. The young skipper handed him
a clip board with the names of the passengers and crew
and followed Strong.</p>

<p>"We will abandon ship in alphabetical order," announced
Tom. "Miss Nancy Anderson?"</p>

<p>A young girl about sixteen stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Just stand there by the hatch, Miss," said Tom. He
glanced at the next name. "Miss Elizabeth Anderson?"
Another girl, looking very much like the first, stepped
forward and stood beside her sister.</p>

<p>"Mrs. John Bailey?" called Tom.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>A gray-haired woman of about sixty stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, but I would rather remain with my
husband, and go later with him."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, Mary," pleaded an elderly man, holding his
arm around her shoulder. "Go now. I'll be all right.
Won't I, sir?" He looked at Tom anxiously.</p>

<p>"I can't be sure, sir," said Tom. He found it difficult
to control his voice as he looked down at the old couple,
who couldn't weigh more than two hundred
pounds between them.</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay," said the woman firmly.</p>

<p>"As you wish, Madam," said Tom. He looked at the
list again. "Mrs. Helen Carson?"</p>

<p>A woman about thirty-five, carrying a young boy
about four years old, stepped out and took her place beside
the two sisters.</p>

<p>In a moment, the first eight passengers were assembled
into two groups, helped into space suits, with a
special portable suit for the little boy, and loaded in
the jet boats. The red light over the hatch glowed, then
went out. The first load of passengers had left the <i>Lady
Venus</i>.</p>

<p>"They're pretty jumpy," Roger whispered, nodding
toward the remaining passengers.</p>

<p>"Yeah," answered Tom. "Say, where's Astro?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Probably went to take a look at the
jet boats to see if one could be repaired so we'd have a
third ferry running."</p>

<p>"Good idea," said Tom. "See if you can't cheer these
people up, Roger. Tell them stories or sing songs&mdash;or
better yet, get them to sing. Try to make them forget
they're sitting on an atom bomb!"</p>

<p>"I can't forget it myself," said Roger. "How can I
make them forget it?"</p>

<p>"Try anything. I'll go see if I can't give Astro a hand!"</p>

<p>Roger turned to face the assembled passengers and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>smiled. All around him in the main passenger lounge,
the frightened men and women sat huddled together in
small groups, staring at him, terror in their eyes.</p>

<p>"Ladieeees and Gentlemen," began Roger. "You are
now going to be entertained by the loudest, corniest
and most miserable voice in the universe. I'm going to
<i>sing</i>!"</p>

<p>He waited for a laugh, but there was only a slight
stir as the passengers shifted nervously in their seats.</p>

<p>Shrugging his shoulders, Roger took a deep breath
and began to sing. He only knew one song and he sang
it with gusto.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From the rocket fields of the Academy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the far-flung stars of outer space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're Space Cadets training to be...."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the lower deck of the passenger ship, Tom smiled
as he faintly heard his unit-mate's voice. He made his
way to the jet-boat deck of the <i>Lady Venus</i> and opened
the hatch.</p>

<p>"Hey, Astro," he called. There wasn't any answer.</p>

<p>He stepped inside and looked around the empty deck.
Walking over to one of the jet boats, he saw evidence
of Al James's attempts to send out emergency signal
messages. He called again. "Hey, Astro&mdash;where are
you?" Still no answer. He noticed that one of the jet
boats was missing. There were three still on the deck,
but an empty catapult for the fourth made Tom think
that Astro might have repaired the fourth and taken it
out in space for a test. The light over the escape hatch
indicated that someone had gone out. It was odd,
thought Tom, for Astro to go out alone. But then he
shrugged, remembering how Astro could lose himself
in his work and forget everything but the job at
hand. He climbed back to the passenger deck.</p>

<p>When Tom opened the hatch to the main lounge, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>sight that filled his eyes was so funny that, even in the
face of danger, he had to laugh. Roger, with his hands
clasped behind his back, was down on his knees trying
to push a food pellet across the deck with his nose. The
whole passenger lounge echoed with hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>Suddenly the laughter was stopped by the sound of
the bell over the air-lock hatch. Strong and James had
returned to ferry more passengers to the <i>Polaris</i>. Immediately
the fun was forgotten and the passengers
crowded around for the roll call.</p>

<p>"Where's Astro?" asked Strong, as he reappeared in
the lounge.</p>

<p>"He's down on the jet-boat deck, sir, trying to fix another
one," replied Tom. "I think he's out testing one
now."</p>

<p>"Good," said Strong. "How're they taking it?" He indicated
the passengers.</p>

<p>"Roger's been keeping them amused with games and
songs, sir," said Tom proudly.</p>

<p>"They'll need it. I don't mind telling you, Corbett,"
said Strong, "it's a wonder to me this tub hasn't blown
up already."</p>

<p>In less than a half hour, the forty passengers and
crewmen of the <i>Lady Venus</i> were transferred in alphabetical
order to the waiting <i>Polaris</i>. Roger kept up a
continual line of patter and jokes and stories, making a
fool of himself, but keeping the remaining passengers
amused and their minds off the dangers of the rapidly
building reaction mass.</p>

<p>"Just one passenger left," said Strong, "with myself
and you three. I think we can squeeze five in that jet
boat and get off here."</p>

<p>"That's for me," said Roger. "I'm the only man in the
whole universe that's ever played to a packed house sitting
on top of an atomic bomb!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Barrymore," said Strong, "get aboard!"</p>

<p>"Say," asked Tom, "where's Astro?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Roger. "I thought you went
to find him half an hour ago!"</p>

<p>"I did," said Tom, "but when I went to the jet-boat
deck, one was missing. So I figured he had fixed one
and taken it out for a test."</p>

<p>"Then he's probably outside in space now!" said
Strong. Suddenly the Solar Guard captain caught himself.
"Wait a minute! How many jet boats were on the
deck, Corbett?"</p>

<p>"Three, sir."</p>

<p>"Then Astro is still aboard the ship," said Strong. "He
couldn't have taken a boat. James told me he couldn't
repeat the message he sent out because he only had the
power of <i>three</i> jet boats. One was damaged and left behind
at Atom City!"</p>

<p>"By the rings of Saturn," said Roger, "a coupla million
miles from home, sitting on an atomic bomb and
that big Venusian hick decides to play hide-and-seek!"</p>

<p>"Never mind the cracks," said Strong. "We've got to
find him!"</p>

<p>"Captain," said the little man with the round face
and glasses who had first spoken to Strong when he
came aboard, "just because my name happens to be
Zewbriski, and I have to be the very last to get on a jet
boat, I don't see why I have to wait any longer. I demand
to be taken off this ship immediately! I refuse to
risk my life waiting around for some foolish cadet!"</p>

<p>"That foolish cadet, Mr. Zewbriski," said Strong
coldly, "is a human being like you and we don't budge
until we find him!"</p>

<p>At that moment the bell began to ring, indicating that
the outer hatch to the air lock was opening.</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna," said Tom, "that must be
Astro now!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if it is," said Roger, "how did he get out there?"</p>

<p>From behind them, the hatch to the inner air lock
opened and Al James stepped through.</p>

<p>"Captain Strong," he said excitedly, "you've got to
come quickly. Some of the crewmen have broken into
your arms locker and taken paralo-ray guns. They
threaten to leave you here if you don't return to the
ship within five minutes. They're afraid the <i>Venus</i>
might blow up and damage the <i>Polaris</i> at this close
range." The young skipper, his red-brown uniform torn
and dirty, looked at the Solar Guard captain with wild-eyed
desperation.</p>

<p>"They can't leave us here," whimpered Zewbriski.
"We'll all be blown to bits!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" barked Strong. He turned to Tom and
Roger. "I can do one of two things," he said. "I can order
you to return to the <i>Polaris</i> now, with James and
myself, or you can volunteer to stay behind and search
for Astro."</p>

<p>Without looking at Roger, Tom answered, "We'll
stay, sir. And we won't have to search for him. I think
I know where he is."</p>

<p>"Now that I think about it," replied Strong, "I guess
there is only one place he could be."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom, "down on the power deck trying
to save this wagon! Come on, Roger! Let's get him!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_15" id="CHAPTER_15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

<p>"What's the reading on the Geiger counter now?" asked
Tom.</p>

<p>Roger looked down at the face of the radioactive
measuring device and answered, "She's been dropping
for the last five minutes, Tom. Looks like the mass in
number three is cooling off. Fourteen hundred and ten
now."</p>

<p>"That's not fast enough," said Astro, straightening up
from tightening a nut on the lead baffle. "She's still
plenty hot. That mass should have been dumped out of
the rocket exhaust right away. Now the whole tube control
box is so hot with radiation, it'd burn you to a crisp
if you opened the hatch."</p>

<p>"Good thing you brought along those tools from the
<i>Polaris</i>," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yeah, greaseball," said Roger, "you used your head
for once. Now let's see you use it again and pile out of
this hunk of junk!"</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred on the counter is the danger mark,
Roger, and as long as we keep it under that, I'm going
to try and save this wagon!" replied Astro.</p>

<p>"Why? To get yourself a Solar Medal?" asked Roger
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"What do you think made this tub act up like this,
Astro?" asked Tom, ignoring Roger's remark.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Using special reactant feed, Tom," replied Astro.
"This is a converted chemical burner&mdash;with an old-type
cooling pump. It's touchy stuff."</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't we drive boron rods into the mass
and slow down the reaction?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"No, Tom," answered Astro, "the control for the rods
are inside the tube control box. We can't reach it."</p>

<p>There was a sudden loud ticking from the Geiger
counter.</p>

<p>"Astro!" cried Roger. "The mass is building!"</p>

<p>"Here, lemme see!" shouted Astro. He took the instrument
in his big hand and watched the clocklike
face intently.</p>

<p>" ... fourteen hundred thirty&mdash;fourteen hundred
fifty&mdash;fourteen hundred seventy&mdash;" He faced his unit-mates.
"Well, that does it. The mass is maintaining a
steady reaction without the energizing pumps. It's sustaining
itself!"</p>

<p>"But how is that possible?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"It's one of those freaks, Tom. It's been known to
happen before. The fuel is just hot enough to sustain a
steady reaction because of its high intensity. Once that
baffle worked loose, the mass started wildcatting itself."</p>

<p>"And if it doesn't stop?" asked Roger tensely.</p>

<p>"It'll reach a point where the reaction comes so fast
it'll explode!"</p>

<p>"Let's pile out of here!" said Roger.</p>

<p>The three boys made a dash for their space suits and
the jet boat. Inside the air lock, they adjusted their oxygen
valves and waited for pressure to equalize so they
could blast off.</p>

<p>"Blast it," said Astro, "there must be some way to get
to that rocket tube and dump that stuff!"</p>

<p>"Impossible, Astro," said Roger. "The release controls
are in the control box, and with all that radiation loose,
you wouldn't last half a minute!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom walked over to the valve that would open the
outside hatch.</p>

<p>"Wonder how Captain Strong is making out with
those tough babies on the <i>Polaris</i>?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Roger, "but anything would
be better than sitting around waiting for this thing to
blow up!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;stop griping," said Astro, "or I'll shove you up
a rocket tube and blast you from here all the way back
to Atom City!"</p>

<p>"Hey, wait a minute!" shouted Tom. "Astro, remember
the time we were on the ground crew as extra duty
and we had to overhaul the <i>Polaris</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, why?"</p>

<p>"There was one place you couldn't go. You were too
big, so I went in, remember?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, the space between the rocket tubes and the
hull of the ship. It was when we were putting in the
new tube. So what?"</p>

<p>"So this!" said Tom. "When they converted this tub,
they had standard exhausts, so it must have the same
layout as the <i>Polaris</i>. Suppose I climb in the main exhaust,
between the tube and the outer hull, and cut
away the cleats that hold the tube to the ship?"</p>

<p>"Why, then everything would come out in one
piece!" Astro's face lit up. "Reactant mass, tube, control
box&mdash;the works!"</p>

<p>"Say, what are you two guys talking about?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"Saving a ship, Roger," said Tom. "Dumping the
whole assembly of the number-three rocket!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you're space happy!"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Tom, "but I think it's worth trying.
How about it, Astro?"</p>

<p>"O.K. by me, Tom," replied Astro.</p>

<p>"Good. You get the cutting torches rigged, Astro.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>Roger, you give him a hand and keep your eye on the
counter. Then feed the torches to me when I get inside
the tube. I'm going outside to get rid of a bad rocket
and save a five-million-credit spaceship!"</p>

<p>Before Astro or Roger could protest, Tom opened
the hatch and began to climb out on the steel hull toward
the rocket tubes, main exhaust.</p>

<p>His magnetic-soled shoes gripping the smooth steel
hull, the cadet made his way aft to the stern of the ship
and began the climb down around the huge firing
tubes and into the tubes themselves.</p>

<p>"Hey, Astro," he yelled into the spacephone, "I'm inside
the tubes. How about those torches?" The cadets
had adjusted the wave length so that all could hear
what was said.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, spaceboy," said Roger, "I'm leaving the
hatch now. You and your fatheaded friend from Venus
are so hopped up for getting a Solar Medal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Knock it off, Manning!" said Astro from inside the
ship. "And for your information, I don't want a medal.
I don't want anything except for you to stop griping!"</p>

<p>Roger reached the end of the ship and began to
climb down inside the tube where Tom was waiting
for him.</p>

<p>"O.K., spaceboy," said Roger, "here're your cutting
torches." He started moving back. "I'll see you around.
I don't mind being a little hero for saving people and
all that stuff. But not for any ship. And the odds against
a big hero staying alive are too big!"</p>

<p>"Roger, wait," shouted Tom. "I'll need...." And
then the curly-headed cadet clamped his teeth together
and turned back to the task at hand.</p>

<p>He made adjustments on the nozzle of the cutting
torch, and then, focusing his chest light, called to Astro.</p>

<p>"O.K., Astro," he said, "shoot me the juice!"</p>

<p>"Coming up, Tom!" answered Astro. "And wait till I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>get my hands on that Manning! I'm going to smear that
yellow space crawler from one corner of the universe to
another!"</p>

<p>"Never mind the talk," snarled Roger, who at the
moment was re-entering the tube. "Just get that juice
down to this torch and make it fast!"</p>

<p>Tom turned to see Roger crawling back into the tube
and adjusting a cutting torch.</p>

<p>"Glad to have you aboard, Roger," said Tom with a
smile that Roger could not see in the darkness of the
tube. The two boys went to work.</p>

<p>Suddenly the torches came to life. And immediately
Tom and Roger began to cut away at the cleats that
held the tube lining to the skin of the ship. Steadily,
the cadets worked their way up toward the center of
the ship, cutting anything that looked as though it
might hold the giant tube to the ship.</p>

<p>"Boy," said Tom, "it's getting hot in here!"</p>

<p>From inside the ship, Astro's reassuring voice came
back in answer. "You're getting close to the reactant-mass
chamber. The last cleat is up by one of the exhaust
gratings. Think you can last it?"</p>

<p>"Well, if he can't," snarled Roger, "he's sure to get
that medal anyway!" He inched up a little. "Move over,
Corbett, I'm skinnier than you are, and I can reach that
cleat easier than you can."</p>

<p>Roger slipped past Tom and inched his way toward
the last cleat. He pulled his torch up alongside and
pulled the trigger. The flame shot out and began eating
the steel. In a moment the last cleat was cut and
the two boys started their long haul down the tube to
the outside of the ship.</p>

<p>As they walked across the steel surface, back to the
air lock, Tom stuck out his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came back, Roger."</p>

<p>"Save it for the boys that fall for that stuff, Corbett,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>said Roger sarcastically. "I came back because I didn't
want you and that Venusian hick to think you're the
only ones with guts around here!"</p>

<p>"No one has ever accused you of not having guts,
Roger."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;go blast your jets," snarled Roger.</p>

<p>They went directly to the power deck where Astro
was waiting for them, the Geiger counter in his hand.</p>

<p>"All set to get rid of the rotten apple?" he asked with
a smile.</p>

<p>"All set, Astro," said Tom. "What's the count?"</p>

<p>"She seems to have steadied around fourteen hundred
ninety&mdash;and believe me, the ten points to the official
danger mark of fifteen hundred is so small that we
could find out where the angels live any moment now!"</p>

<p>"Then what're we waiting for," said Tom. "Let's dump
that thing!"</p>

<p>"How?" snarled Roger.</p>

<p>Tom and Astro looked at him bewilderedly. "What do
you mean 'how'?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"I mean how are you going to get the tube out of
the ship?"</p>

<p>"Why," started Tom, "there's nothing holding that
tube assembly to the ship now. We cut all the cleats,
remember? We can jettison the whole unit!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," drawled Roger lazily, "that the
two great heroes in their mad rush for the Solar Medal
have forgotten an unwritten law of space. There's no
gravity out here&mdash;no natural force to pull or push the
tube. The only way it could be moved is by the power
of thrust, either forward or backward!"</p>

<p>"O.K. Then let's push it out, just that way," said Astro.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Roger cynically.</p>

<p>"Simple, Roger," said Tom, "Newton's Laws of motion.
Everything in motion tends to keep going at the
same speed unless influenced by an outside force. So if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>we blasted our nose rockets and started going backward,
everything on the ship would go backward too,
then if we reversed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Astro cut in, "Yeah&mdash;if we blasted the stern rockets,
the ship would go forward, but the tube, being loose,
would keep going the other way!"</p>

<p>"There's only one thing wrong," said Roger. "That
mass is so hot now, if any booster energy hit it, it would
be like a trigger on a bomb. It'd blow us from here to
the next galaxy!"</p>

<p>"I'm willing to try it," said Tom. "How about you,
Astro?"</p>

<p>"I've gone this far, and I'm not quitting now."</p>

<p>They turned to face Roger.</p>

<p>"Well, how about it, Roger?" asked Tom. "No one
will think you're yellow if you take the jet boat and
leave now."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;talk again!" grumbled Roger. "We always have
to talk. Let's be original for a change and just do our
jobs!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Tom. "Take an emergency light and
signal Captain Strong. Tell him what we're going to do.
Warn him to stay away&mdash;about two hundred miles off.
He'll know if we're successful or not within a half
hour!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Roger, "then we'll send him one big
flash to mean we failed! <i>Bon voyage!</i>"</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, as the <i>Lady Venus</i> drifted in
her silent but deadly orbit, Tom, Roger and Astro still
worked feverishly as the Geiger counter ticked off the
increasing radioactivity of the wildcatting reaction
mass in number-three rocket tube.</p>

<p>"Reading on the counter still's going up, Astro,"
warned Roger. "Fifteen-O-five."</p>

<p>"Hurry it up, Astro," urged Tom.</p>

<p>"Hand me that wrench, Tom," ordered Astro. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>big cadet, stripped to the waist, his thick arms and
chest splattered with grease and sweat, fitted the
wrench to the nut and applied pressure. Tom and
Roger watched the muscles ripple along his back, as
the big Venusian pitted all of his great strength against
the metal.</p>

<p>"Give it all you've got," said Tom. "If we do manage
to jettison that tube, we've got to keep this part of the
power deck airtight!"</p>

<p>Astro pulled harder. The veins standing out on his
neck. At last, easing off, he stood up and looked down
at the nut.</p>

<p>"That's as tight as I can get it," he said, breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>"Or anyone else," said Tom.</p>

<p>"All the valve connections broken?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Yep," replied Roger. "We're sealed tight."</p>

<p>"That's it, then," said Tom. "Let's get to the control
deck and start blasting!"</p>

<p>Astro turned to the power-deck control board and
checked the gauges for the last time. From above his
head, he heard Tom's voice over the intercom.</p>

<p>"All your relays to the power deck working, Astro?"</p>

<p>"Ready, Tom," answered Astro.</p>

<p>"Then stand by," said Tom on the control deck. He
had made a hasty check of the controls and found them
to be similar enough to those on the <i>Polaris</i> so that he
could handle the ship. He flipped the switch to the
radar deck and spoke into the intercom.</p>

<p>"Do we have a clear trajectory fore and aft, Roger?"</p>

<p>"All clear," replied Roger. "I sent Captain Strong the
message."</p>

<p>"What'd he say?"</p>

<p>"The rebellion wasn't anything more than a bunch of
badly scared old men. Al James just got hysterical,
that's all."

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did he have to say about this operation?"</p>

<p>"I can't repeat it for your young ears," said Roger.</p>

<p>"So bad, huh?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but not because we're trying to save the ship."</p>

<p>"Then why?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"He's afraid of losing a good unit!"</p>

<p>Tom smiled and turned to the control board. "Energize
the cooling pumps!" he bawled to Astro over the
intercom.</p>

<p>The slow whine of the pumps began to build to a
shrieking pitch.</p>

<p>"Pumps in operation, Tom," said Astro.</p>

<p>"Cut in nose braking rockets," ordered Tom.</p>

<p>A low muted roar pulsed through the ship.</p>

<p>"Rockets on&mdash;we're moving backward, Tom," reported
Astro.</p>

<p>And then suddenly Astro let out a roar. "Tom, the
Geiger counter is going wild!"</p>

<p>"Never mind that now," answered Tom. "Sound off,
Roger!" he yelled.</p>

<p>"Ship moving astern&mdash;one thousand feet a second&mdash;two
thousand&mdash;four thousand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to let her build to ten, Roger," yelled
Tom. "We've only got one chance and we might as well
make it a good one!"</p>

<p>"Six thousand!" yelled Roger. "Seven thousand!"</p>

<p>"Astro," bellowed Tom, "stand by to fire stern rockets!"</p>

<p>"Ready, Tom," was Astro's reply.</p>

<p>"Eight thousand," warned Roger. "Spaceman's luck,
fellas!"</p>

<p>The silver ship moved through space away from the
<i>Polaris</i>.</p>

<p>"Nine thousand," reported Roger. "And, Astro, I really
love ya!"</p>

<p>"Cut nose braking rockets!" ordered Tom.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sudden hush that seemed to be as loud
as the noise of the rockets. The huge passenger ship,
<i>Lady Venus</i>, was traveling through space as silent as a
ghost.</p>

<p>"Nine thousand five hundred feet a second," yelled
Roger.</p>

<p>"Stand by, Astro, Roger! Hang on tight, and spaceman's
luck!"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand feet a second!" Roger's voice was a
hoarse scream.</p>

<p>"<i>Fire stern rockets!</i>" bawled Tom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_16" id="CHAPTER_16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

<p>Under the tremendous drive of the stern rockets, the
silver ship suddenly hurtled forward as if shot out of a
cannon. The dangerous tube slid out of the stern of the
ship and was quickly left behind as the <i>Lady Venus</i>
sped in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"That's it," yelled Tom, "hold full space speed! We
dumped the tube, but we're still close enough for it to
blow us from here to Pluto!"</p>

<p>"I tracked it on the radar, Tom," yelled Roger. "I
think we're far enough away to miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment a tremendous flash of light filled the
radar scanner as the mass exploded miles to the rear of
the <i>Lady Venus</i>.</p>

<p>"There it goes!" shouted Roger.</p>

<p>"Great jumping Jupiter," yelled Tom, "and we're still
in one piece! We did it!"</p>

<p>From the power deck, Astro's bull-like roar could be
heard through the whole ship.</p>

<p>"Gimme an open circuit, Tom," said Astro. "I want
to operate the air blowers down here and try to get rid
of some of that radiation. I have to get into the control
chamber and see what's going on."</p>

<p>Tom flipped a switch on the board and set the ship
on automatic flight. Then, turning to the teleceiver, he
switched the set on.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Lady Venus</i> to <i>Polaris</i>&mdash;" said Tom, "come in, <i>Polaris</i>&mdash;come
in!"</p>

<p>" ... Strong here on the <i>Polaris</i>!" the officer's voice
crackled over the speaker. "By the rings of Saturn, I
should log you three space-brained idiots for everything
in the book!" Strong's face gradually focused on
the teleceiver screen and he stared at Tom coldly.
"That was the most foolish bit of heroics I've ever seen
and if I had my way I'd&mdash;I'll&mdash;well&mdash;" The captain's
glare melted into a smile. "I'll spend the rest of my life
being known as the skipper of the three heroes! Well
done, Corbett, it was foolish and dangerous, but well
done!"</p>

<p>Tom, his face changing visibly with each change in
Strong's attitude, finally broke out into a grin.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Tom, "but Astro and Roger did
as much as I did."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they did," replied Strong. "Tell them I
think it was one of the&mdash;the&mdash;" he thought a moment
and then added, "darndest, most foolish things&mdash;most&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom, trying hard to control his face.
He knew the moment for disciplining had passed, and
that Captain Strong was just overwhelmed with concern
for their safety.</p>

<p>"Stand by the air locks, Corbett, we're coming
aboard again. We're pretty cramped for space here on
the <i>Polaris</i>."</p>

<p>Just then Astro yelled up from the power deck.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom!" he called. "If Captain Strong is thinking
about putting those passengers back aboard, I think
you'd better tell him about the radiation. I haven't
been able to flush it all out yet. And since we only have
three lead-lined suits...." He left the statement unfinished.</p>

<p>"I get you, Astro," replied Tom. He turned back to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>the teleceiver and faced Strong. "Astro says the ship is
still hot from radiation, sir. And that he hasn't been
able to flush it out with the blowers."</p>

<p>"Ummmmh," mused Strong thoughtfully. "Well, in
that case, stand by, Corbett. I'll get in touch with Commander
Walters right away."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," replied Tom. He turned from the
teleceiver and climbed up to the radar deck.</p>

<p>"Well, hot-shot," said Roger, "looks like you've made
yourself a hero this trip."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, Roger?"</p>

<p>"First, you run off with top honors on the space maneuvers,
and now you save the ship and have Strong
eating out of your hand!"</p>

<p>"That's not very funny, Roger," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I think it is," drawled Roger.</p>

<p>Tom studied the blond cadet for a moment.</p>

<p>"What's eating you, Roger? Since the day you came
into the Academy, you've acted like you hated every
minute of it. And yet, on the other hand, I've seen you
act like it was the most important thing in your life.
Why?"</p>

<p>"I told you once, Corbett," said Roger with the
sneering air which Tom knew he used when he was on
the defensive, "that I had my own special reasons for
being here. I'm <i>not</i> a hero, Corbett! Never was and
never will be. You're strictly the hero type. Tried and
true, a thousand just like you all through the Academy
and the Solar Guard. Strong is a hero type!"</p>

<p>"Then what about Al James?" asked Tom. "What
about that time in Atom City when you defended the
Academy?"</p>

<p>"Uh-uh," grunted Roger, "I wasn't defending the
Academy. I was just avoiding a fight." He paused and
eyed Tom between half-closed lids. "You'll never do
anything I can't, or won't do, just as well, Tom. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>difference between us is simple. I'm in the Academy
for a reason, a special reason. You're here, like most of
the other cadets, because you believe in it. That's the
difference between you, me and Astro. You believe in
it. I don't&mdash;I don't believe in anything but Roger
Manning!"</p>

<p>Tom faced him squarely. "I'm not going to buy that,
Roger! I don't think that's true. And the reasons I don't
believe it are many. You have a chip on your shoulder,
yes. But I don't think you're selfish or that you only believe
in Manning. If you did, you wouldn't be here on
the <i>Lady Venus</i>. You had your chance to escape back
in the rocket tube, but you <i>came back</i>, Roger, and you
made a liar out of yourself!"</p>

<p>"Hey, you guys!" yelled Astro, coming up behind
them. "I thought we left that stuff back at the Academy?"</p>

<p>Tom turned to face the power-deck cadet. "What's
cooking below, Astro? Were you able to get rid of the
radiation?"</p>

<p>"Naw!" replied the cadet from Venus. "Too hot!
Couldn't even open the hatch. It'll take a special job
with the big equipment at the space shipyards. We
need their big blowers and antiradiation flushers to
clean this baby up."</p>

<p>"Then I'd better tell Captain Strong right away. He's
going to get in touch with Commander Walters at the
Academy for orders."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're right," said Astro. "There isn't a chance
of getting those people back aboard here now. Once
we opened up that outer control deck to dump that
tube, the whole joint started buzzing with radioactive
electrons."</p>

<p>Tom turned to the ladder leading to the control deck
and disappeared through the hatch, leaving Astro and
Roger alone.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was that little bit of space gas about, Roger?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;nothing," replied Roger. "Just a little argument
on who was the biggest hero." Roger smiled and waved
a hand in a friendly gesture. "Tom won, two to
one!"</p>

<p>"He sure handled that control deck like he had been
born here, all right," said Astro. "Well, I've got to take
a look at those motors. We'll be doing something soon,
and whatever it is, we'll need those power boxes to get
us where we want to go."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Roger, "and I've got to get a course and
a position." He turned to the chart screen and began
plotting rapidly. Down on the control deck, Strong was
listening to Tom.</p>

<p>" ... and Astro said we'd need the special equipment
at the space shipyards to clean out the radiation,
sir. If we took passengers aboard and it suddenly shot
up&mdash;well, we only have the three lead-lined suits to protect
us."</p>

<p>"Very well, Corbett," replied Strong. "I've just received
orders from Commander Walters to proceed to
Mars with both ships. I'll blast off now and you three
follow along on the <i>Lady Venus</i>. Any questions?"</p>

<p>"I don't have any, sir," Tom said, "but I'll check with
Roger and Astro to see if they have any."</p>

<p>Tom turned to the intercom and informed the radar
and power-deck cadets of their orders, and asked if
there were any questions. Both replied that everything
on the ship was ready to blast off immediately. Tom
turned back to the teleceiver.</p>

<p>"No questions, sir," reported Tom. "We're all set to
blast off."</p>

<p>"Very well, Corbett," said Strong. "I'm going to make
as much speed as possible to get these people on Mars.
The crew of the <i>Lady Venus</i> will take over the radar
and power decks."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"O.K., sir, and spaceman's luck!" said Tom. "We'll see
you on Mars!"</p>

<p>Tom stood beside the crystal port on the control deck
and watched the rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>' stern glow red
from her jets, and then quickly disappear into the vastness
of space, visible only as a white blip on the radar
scanner.</p>

<p>"Get me a course to Mars, Roger," said Tom. "Astro,
stand by to blast off with as much speed as you can
safely get out of this old wagon, and stand by for
Mars!"</p>

<p>The two cadets quickly reported their departments
ready, and following the course Roger plotted, Astro
soon had the <i>Lady Venus</i> blasting through space, heading
for Mars!</p>

<p>Mars, fourth planet in order from the Sun, loomed
like a giant red gem against a perfect backdrop of deep-black
space. The <i>Lady Venus</i>, rocketing through the
inky blackness, a dull red glow from her three remaining
rockets, blasted steadily ahead to the planet that
was crisscrossed with wide spacious canals.</p>

<p>"Last time I was on Mars," said Astro to Tom and
Roger over a cup of tea, "was about two years ago. I
was bucking rockets on an old tub called the <i>Space
Plunger</i>. It was on a shuttle run from the Martian south
pole to Venusport, hauling vegetables. What a life!
Burning up on Venus and then freezing half to death
at the south pole on Mars." Astro shook his head as the
vivid memory took him back for a moment.</p>

<p>"From what I hear," said Tom, "there isn't much to
see but the few cities, the mountains, the deserts and
the canals."</p>

<p>"Yeah," commented Roger, "big deal! Rocket into the
wild depths of space and see the greatest hunk of
wasteland in the universe!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The three boys were silent, listening to the steady
hum of the rockets, driving them forward toward
Mars. For four days they had traveled on the <i>Lady
Venus</i>, enjoying the many luxuries found on the passenger
ship. Now, with their destination only a few
hours away, they were having a light snack before
making a touchdown on Mars.</p>

<p>"You know," said Tom quietly, "I've been thinking.
As far back as the twentieth century, Earthmen have
wanted to get to Mars. And finally they did. And what
have they found? Nothing but a planet full of dry sand,
a few canals and dwarf mountains."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I've been saying!" said Roger.
"The only man who ever got anything out of all this
was the first man to make it to Mars and return. He got
the name, the glory, and a paragraph in a history book!
And after that, nothing!" He got up and climbed the
ladder to the radar deck, leaving Astro and Tom alone.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ship lurched to one side.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Tom.</p>

<p>A bell began to ring. Then another&mdash;and then three
more. Finally the entire ship was vibrating with the
clanging of emergency bells.</p>

<p>Astro made a diving leap for the ladder leading down
to the power deck, with Tom lunging for the control
board.</p>

<p>Quickly Tom glanced about the huge board with its
many different gauges and dials, searching for the one
that would indicate the trouble. His eye spotted a huge
gauge. A small light beside it flashed off and on. "By
the moons of Jupiter, we've run out of reactant fuel!"</p>

<p>"Tom!&mdash;Tom!" shouted Astro from the power deck.
"We're smack out of reactant feed!"</p>

<p>"Isn't there any left at all?" asked Tom. "Not even
enough to get us into Marsopolis?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"We haven't enough left to keep the generator going!"
said Astro. "Everything, including the lights and
the teleceiver, will go any minute!"</p>

<p>"Then we can't change course!"</p>

<p>"Right," drawled Roger. "And if we can't change
course, the one we're on now will take us straight into
Mars's gravity and we crash!"</p>

<p>"Send out an emergency call right away, Roger,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"Can't, spaceboy," replied Roger in his lazy drawl.
"Not enough juice to call for help. Or haven't you noticed
you're standing in the dark?"</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;how could this happen?" asked Tom, puzzled.
"We were only going at half speed and using just
three rockets!"</p>

<p>"When we got rid of that hot tube back in space,"
explained Astro grimly, "we dumped the main reactant
mass. There isn't a thing we can do!"</p>

<p>"We've got one choice," said Tom hollowly. "We can
either pile out now, in space suits and use the jet boat,
and hope for someone to pick us up before the oxygen
gives out, or we can ride this space wagon right on in.
Make up your minds quick, we're already inside Mars's
gravity pull!"</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Astro's voice filled the control
deck. "I'll ride this baby right to the bottom. If I'm
going to splash in, I'll take it on solid ground, even if it
is Mars and not Venus. I don't want to wash out in
space!"</p>

<p>"That goes for me, too," said Roger.</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Tom. "Here we go. Just keep your fingers
crossed that we hit the desert instead of the mountains,
or we'll be smeared across those rocks like applesauce.
Spaceman's luck, fellas!"</p>

<p>"Spaceman's luck, both of you," said Astro.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just plain ordinary luck," commented Roger, "and
plenty of it!"</p>

<p>The three boys quickly strapped themselves into acceleration
seats, with Tom hooking up an emergency
relay switch that he could hold in his hand. He hoped
he would remain conscious long enough to throw the
switch and start the water sprinkler in case the ship
caught fire.</p>

<p>The <i>Lady Venus</i> flashed into the thin atmosphere
from the void of space and the three cadets imagined
that they could hear the shriek of the ship as it cut
through the thin air. Tom figured his speed rapidly,
and counting on the thinness of the atmosphere, he estimated
that it would take eleven seconds for the ship
to crash. He began to count.</p>

<p>" ... One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;" he thought
briefly of his family and how nice they had been to him
" ... six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ship crashed.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_17" id="CHAPTER_17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

<p>"Astro! Roger!" yelled Tom. He opened his eyes and
then felt the weight on his chest. A section of the control
board had fallen across him pinning his left arm to
his side. He reached for the railing around the acceleration
chair with his right and discovered he still held
the switch for the water sprinkler. He started to flip it
on, then sniffed the air, and smelling no trace of smoke,
dropped the switch. He unstrapped himself from the
acceleration chair with his right hand and then slowly,
with great effort, pushed the section of the control
board off him. He stood up rubbing his left arm.</p>

<p>"Astro? Roger?!" he called again, and scrambled over
the broken equipment that was strewn over the deck.
He stumbled over more rubble that was once a precision
instrument panel and climbed the ladder leading
to the radar deck.</p>

<p>"Roger!" he yelled. "Roger, are you all right?" He
pushed several shattered instruments out of the way
and looked around the shambles that once had been a
room. He didn't see Roger.</p>

<p>He began to scramble through the litter on the deck,
kicking aside instruments that were nearly priceless,
so delicately were they made. Suddenly a wave of cold
fear gripped him and he began tearing through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>rubble desperately. From beneath a heavy tube casing,
he could see the outstretched arm of Roger.</p>

<p>He squatted down, bending his legs and keeping his
back straight. Then gripping the heavy casing on one
side, he tried to stand up. It was too much for him. He
lifted it three inches and then had to let go.</p>

<p>"Tom! Roger!" Tom heard the bull-like roar of Astro
below him and stumbled over to the head of the ladder.</p>

<p>"Up here, Astro," he yelled, "on the radar deck. Roger's
pinned under the radar scanner casing!"</p>

<p>Tom turned back to the casing, and looking around
the littered deck desperately, grabbed an eight-foot
length of steel pipe that had been snapped off like a
twig by the force of the crash.</p>

<p>Barely able to lift it, he shoved it with all his strength
to get the end of the pipe beneath the casing.</p>

<p>"Here, let me get at that thing," growled Astro from
behind. Tom stepped back, half falling out of the Venusian's
way, and watched as Astro got down on his
hands and knees, putting his shoulder against the case.
He lifted it about three inches, then slowly, still balancing
the weight on his shoulder, shifted his position,
braced it with his hands and began to straighten up.
The casing came up from the floor as the huge cadet
strained against it.</p>

<p>"All&mdash;right&mdash;Tom&mdash;" he gasped, "see if you can get
a hold on Roger and pull him out!"</p>

<p>Tom scrambled back and grabbed Roger's uniform.
He pulled, and slowly the cadet's form slid from beneath
the casing.</p>

<p>"All right, Astro," said Tom, "I've got 'im."</p>

<p>Astro began to lower the casing in the same manner
in which he had lifted it. He eased it back down to the
floor on his knees and dropped it the last few inches.
He sat on the floor beside it and hung his head between
his knees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you all right, Astro?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Never mind me," panted Astro between deep gasps
for breath, "just see if hot-shot is O.K."</p>

<p>Tom quickly ran his hands up and down Roger's
arms and legs, his chest, collarbone and at last, with
gently probing fingers, his head.</p>

<p>"No broken bones," he said, still looking at Roger,
"but I don't know about internal injuries."</p>

<p>"He wasn't pinned under that thing," said Astro at
last. "It was resting on a beam. No weight was on him."</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;huh&mdash;ahhh&mdash;uhhhh," moaned Roger.</p>

<p>"Roger," said Tom gently, "Roger, are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;huh?&mdash;Ohhhh! My head!"</p>

<p>"Take it easy, hot-shot," said Astro, "that head of
yours is O.K. Nothing&mdash;but <i>nothing</i> could hurt it!"</p>

<p>"Ooohhhh!" groaned Roger, sitting up. "I don't know
which is worse, feeling the way I do, or waking up and
listening to you again!"</p>

<p>Tom sat back with a smile. Roger's remark clinched
it. No one was hurt.</p>

<p>"Well," said Astro at last, "where do we go from
here?"</p>

<p>"First thing I suggest we do is take a survey and see
what's left," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I came up from the power deck," said Astro, "all the
way through the ship. You see this radar deck?" He
made a sweeping gesture around the room that looked
like a junk heap. "Well, it's in good shape, compared to
the rest of the ship. The power deck has the rocket motors
where the master panel should be and the panel is
ready to go into what's left of the reactant chamber.
The jet boat is nothing but a worthless piece of junk!"</p>

<p>The three boys considered the fate of the jet boat
soberly. Finally Astro broke the silence with a question.
"Where do you think we are?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in the New Sahara desert," answered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>Tom. "I had the chart projector on just before we
splashed in, but I can't tell you any more than that."</p>

<p>"Well, at least we have plenty of water," sighed
Roger.</p>

<p>"You <i>had</i> plenty of water. The tanks were smashed
when we came in. Not even a puddle left in a corner."</p>

<p>"Of course it might rain," said Roger.</p>

<p>Tom gave a short laugh. "The last time it rained in
this place dinosaurs were roaming around on Earth!"</p>

<p>"How about food?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Plenty of that," answered Astro. "This is a passenger
ship, remember! They have everything you could ask
for, including smoked Venusian fatfish!"</p>

<p>"Then let's get out of here and take a look," said Tom.</p>

<p>The three bruised but otherwise healthy cadets
climbed slowly down to the control deck and headed
for the galley, where Tom found six plastic containers
of Martian water.</p>

<p>"Spaceman, this is the biggest hunk of luck we've
had in the last two hours," said Roger, taking one of the
containers.</p>

<p>"Why two hours, Roger?" asked Astro, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Two hours ago we were still in space expecting to
splash in," said Tom. He opened one of the containers
and offered it to Astro. "Take it easy, Astro," said Tom.
"Unless we find something else to drink, this might have
to last a long time."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Roger, "a <i>long</i> time. I've been thinking
about our chances of getting out of this mess."</p>

<p>"Well," asked Astro, "what has the great Manning
brain figured out?"</p>

<p>"There's no chance at all," said Roger slowly. "You're
wrong, Corbett, about this being midday. It's early
morning!" He pointed to a chronometer on the bulkhead
behind Astro. "It's still running. I made a mental
note before we splashed in, it was eight-O-seven. That
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>clock says nine-O-three. It doesn't begin to get hot here
until three o'clock in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I think you're wrong two ways," said Tom. "In the
first place, Captain Strong probably has a unit out looking
for us right now. And in the second place, as long
as we stay with the ship, we've got shade. That sun is
only bad because the atmosphere is thinner here on
Mars, and easier to burn through. But if we stay out of
the sun, we're O.K. Just sit back and wait for Strong!"</p>

<p>Roger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well," commented Astro with a grin, "I'm not going
to sit around waiting for Strong without eating!" He
tore open a plastic package of roast-beef sandwiches
and began eating. Tom measured out three small cups
of Martian water.</p>

<p>"After we eat," suggested Roger, "I think we ought
to take a look around outside and try to set up an identification
signal."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," said Tom, "but don't you think
the ship itself is big enough for that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," answered Roger, "I guess you're right."</p>

<p>"Boy!" said Astro. "We sure are lucky to still be able
to argue."</p>

<p>"That's about all you can call it. Luck! Spaceman's
luck!" said Tom. "The only reason I can figure why we
didn't wind up as permanent part of the scenery
around here is because of the course we were on."</p>

<p>"How do you figure that?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Luckily&mdash;and I <i>mean</i> luckily, we were on a course
that took us smack onto the surface of Mars. And our
speed was great enough to resist the gravity pull of the
planet, keeping us horizontal with the surface of the
desert. We skidded in like a kid does on a sled, instead
of coming in on our nose!"</p>

<p>"Well, blast my jets!" said Astro softly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"In that case," said Roger, "we must have left a
pretty long skid mark in back of us!"</p>

<p>"That should be easy to see when the jet scouts come
looking for us," commented Astro.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we could rig up some sort of emergency
signal so we could send out a relative position?"</p>

<p>"How are you going to get the position?" asked
Astro.</p>

<p>"I can give you some sort of position as soon as I get
outside and take a sight on the sun," replied Roger.</p>

<p>"Can you do it without your astrogation prism?"
asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Navigation, not astrogation, Astro," said Roger.
"Like the ancient sailors used on the oceans back on
Earth hundreds of years ago. Only thing is, I'll have to
work up the logarithms by hand, instead of using the
computer. Might be a little rough, but it'll be close
enough for what we want."</p>

<p>The three cadets finished the remaining sandwiches
and then picked their way back through the ship to the
control deck. There, they rummaged through the pile
of broken and shattered instruments.</p>

<p>"If we could find just one tube that hasn't been damaged,
I think I might be able to rig up some sort of one-lung
communications set," said Roger. "It might have
enough range to get a message to the nearest atmosphere
booster station."</p>

<p>"Nothing but a pile of junk here, Roger," said Tom.
"We might find something on the radar deck."</p>

<p>The three members of the <i>Polaris</i> unit climbed over
the rubble and made their way to the radar deck, and
started their search for an undamaged tube. After
forty-five minutes of searching, Roger stood up in disgust.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" he said sourly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"That kills any hope of getting a message out," said
Tom.</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna," said Astro, wiping his forehead.
"I didn't notice it before, but it's getting hotter
here than on the power deck on a trip to Mercury!"</p>

<p>"Do we have any flares?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Naw. Al James used them all," answered Tom.</p>

<p>"That does it," said Roger. "In another couple of
hours, when and if anyone shows up, all they'll find is
three space cadets fried on the half shell of a spaceship!"</p>

<p>"Listen, Roger," said Tom, "as soon as we fail to check
in, the whole Mars Solar Guard fleet will be out looking
for us. Our last report will show them we were heading
in this direction. It won't take Captain Strong long to
figure out that we might have run out of fuel, and, with
that skid mark in the sand trailing back for twenty
miles, all we have to do is stick with the ship and wait
for them to show up!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Astro sharply.</p>

<p>From a distance, the three cadets could hear a low
moaning and wailing. They rushed to the crystal port
and looked out on the endless miles of brown sand,
stretching as far as the horizon and meeting the cloudless
blue sky. Shimmering in the heat, the New Sahara
desert of Mars was just beginning to warm up for the
day under the bleaching sun. The thin atmosphere offered
little protection against the blazing heat rays.</p>

<p>"Nothing but sand," said Tom. "Maybe something is
still hot on the power deck." He looked at Astro.</p>

<p>"I checked it before I came topside," said Astro. "I've
heard that noise before. It can only mean one thing."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>Astro turned quickly and walked to the opposite side
of the littered control deck. He pushed a pile of junk
out of the way for a clear view of the outside.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's your answer," said Astro, pointing at the
port.</p>

<p>"By the rings of Saturn, look at that!" cried Tom.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Roger, "black as the fingernails of a
Titan miner!"</p>

<p>"That's a sandstorm," Astro said finally. "It blows as
long as a week and can pile up sand for two hundred
feet. Sometimes the velocity reaches as much as a hundred
and sixty miles an hour. Once, in the south, we
got caught in one, and it was so bad we had to blast off.
And it took all the power we had to do it!"</p>

<p>The three cadets stood transfixed as they gazed
through the crystal port at the oncoming storm. The
tremendous black cloud rolled toward the spaceship in
huge folds that billowed upward and back in three-thousand-foot
waves. The roar and wail of the wind
grew louder, rising in pitch until it was a shrill scream.</p>

<p>"We'd better get down to the power deck," said Tom,
"and take some oxygen bottles along with us, just in
case. Astro, bring the rest of the Martian water and
you grab several of those containers of food, Roger.
We might be holed in for a long time."</p>

<p>"Why go down to the power deck?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"There's a huge hole in the upper part of the ship's
hull. That sand will come in here by the ton and there's
nothing to stop it," Tom answered Roger, but kept his
eyes on the churning black cloud. Already, the first
gusts of wind were lashing at the stricken <i>Lady Venus</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_18" id="CHAPTER_18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

<p>"You think it'll last much longer?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"I don't know, old fellow," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"You know, sometimes you can hear the wind even
through the skin of the ship," commented Roger.</p>

<p>For two days the cadets of the <i>Polaris</i> unit had been
held prisoner in the power deck while the violence of
the New Sahara sandstorm raged around them outside
the ship. For a thousand square miles the desert was a
black cloud of churning sand, sweeping across the surface
of Mars like a giant shroud.</p>

<p>After many attempts to repair a small generator, Astro
finally succeeded, only to discover that he had no
means of running the unit. His plan was to relieve the
rapidly weakening emergency batteries with a more
steady source of power.</p>

<p>While Astro occupied himself repairing the generator,
Tom and Roger had slept, but after the first day,
when sleep would no longer come, they resorted to
playing checkers with washers and nuts on a board
scratched on the deck.</p>

<p>"Think it's going to let up soon?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"They've been known to last for a week or more,"
said Astro.</p>

<p>"Wonder if Strong has discovered we're missing?"
mused Roger.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure he has," replied Tom. "He's a real spaceman.
Can smell out trouble like a telemetered alarm system."</p>

<p>Astro got up and stretched. "I'll bet we're out of this
five hours after the sand settles down."</p>

<p>The big Venusian walked to the side of the power
deck and pressed his ear against the hull, listening for
the sound of the wind.</p>

<p>After a few seconds he turned back. "I can't hear a
thing, fellas. I have a feeling it's about played itself
out."</p>

<p>"Of course," reasoned Tom, "we have no real way of
knowing when it's stopped and when it hasn't."</p>

<p>"Want to open the hatch and take a look?" asked
Astro.</p>

<p>Tom looked questioningly at Roger, who nodded his
head in agreement.</p>

<p>Tom walked over to the hatch and began undogging
the heavy door. As the last of the heavy metal bars
were raised, sand began to trickle inside around the
edges. Astro bent down and sifted a handful through
his fingers. "It's so fine, it's like powder," he said as it
fell to the deck in a fine cloud.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Tom, "give me a hand with this
hatch. It's probably jammed up against sand on the
other side."</p>

<p>Tom, Roger and Astro braced their shoulders against
the door, but when they tried to push, they lost their
footing and slipped down. Astro dragged over a section
of lead baffle, jammed it between the rocket motors and
placed his feet up against it. Tom and Roger got on either
side of him and pressed their shoulders against the
door.</p>

<p>"All right," said Tom. "When I give the word, let's all
push together. Ready?"</p>

<p>"All set," said Astro.</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Roger.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"O.K.&mdash;then&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;<i>push</i>!"</p>

<p>Together, the three cadets strained against the heavy
steel hatch. The muscles in Astro's legs bulged into
knots as he applied his great weight and strength
against the door. Roger, his face twisted into a grimace
from the effort, finally slumped to the floor, gasping
for breath.</p>

<p>"Roger," asked Tom quickly, "are you all right?"</p>

<p>Roger nodded his head but stayed where he was,
breathing deeply. Finally recovering his strength, he
rose and stood up against the hatch with his two unit-mates.</p>

<p>"You and Roger just give a steady pressure, Tom,"
said Astro. "Don't try to push it all at once. Slow and
steady does it! That way you get more out of your
effort."</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Tom. Roger nodded. Again they braced
themselves against the hatch.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;<i>push</i>!" counted Tom.</p>

<p>Slowly, applying the pressure evenly, they heaved
against the steel hatch. Tom's head swam dizzily, as the
blood raced through his veins.</p>

<p>"Keep going," gasped Astro. "I think it's giving a
little!"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger pushed with the last ounce of
strength in their bodies, and after a final desperate effort,
slumped to the floor breathless. Astro continued to
push, but a moment later, relaxed and slipped down
beside Tom and Roger.</p>

<p>They sat on the deck for nearly five minutes gasping
for air.</p>

<p>"Like&mdash;" began Roger, "like father&mdash;like son!" He
blurted the words out bitterly.</p>

<p>"Like who?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Like my father," said Roger in a hard voice. He got
up and walked unsteadily over to the oxygen bottle and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>kicked it. "Empty!" he said with a harsh laugh. "Empty
and we only have one more bottle. Empty as my head
the day I got into this space-happy outfit!"</p>

<p>"You going to start that again!" growled Astro. "I
thought you had grown out of your childish bellyaching
about the Academy." Astro eyed the blond cadet
with a cold eye. "And now, just because you're in a
tough spot, you start whining again!"</p>

<p>"Knock it off, Astro," snapped Tom. "Come on. Let's
give this hatch another try. I think it gave a little on
that last push."</p>

<p>"Never-say-die Corbett!" snarled Roger. "Let's
give it the old try for dear old Space Academy!"</p>

<p>Tom whirled around and stood face to face with
Manning.</p>

<p>"I think maybe Astro's right, Roger," he said coldly.
"I think you're a foul ball, a space-gassing hot-shot that
can't take it when the chips are down!"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Roger coldly. "I'm just what you
say! Go ahead, push against that hatch until your insides
drop out and see if you can open it!" He paused
and looked directly at Tom. "If that sand has penetrated
inside the ship far enough and heavily enough to jam
that hatch, you can imagine what is on top, outside! A
mountain of sand! And we're buried under it with
about eight hours of oxygen left!"</p>

<p>Tom and Astro were silent, thinking about the truth
in Roger's words. Roger walked slowly across the deck
and stood in front of them defiantly.</p>

<p>"You were counting on the ship being spotted by
Captain Strong or part of a supposed searching party!
Ha! What makes you think three cadets are so important
that the Solar Guard will take time out to look for
us? And if they <i>do</i> come looking for us, the only thing
left up there now"&mdash;he pointed his finger over his head&mdash;"is
a pile of sand like any other sand dune on this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>crummy planet. We're stuck, Corbett, so lay off that
last chance, do-or-die routine. I've been eating glory
all my life. If I do have to splash in now, I want it to be
on my own terms. And that's to just sit here and wait
for it to come. And if they pin the Medal&mdash;the Solar
Medal&mdash;on me, I'm going to be up there where all good
spacemen go, having the last laugh, when they put my
name alongside my father's!"</p>

<p>"Your father's?" asked Tom bewilderedly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, my father. Kenneth Rogers Manning, Captain
in the Solar Guard. Graduate of Space Academy, class
of 2329, killed while on duty in space, June 2335.
Awarded the Solar Medal <i>posthumously</i>. Leaving a
widow and one son, <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Astro and Tom looked at each other dumfounded.</p>

<p>"Surprised, huh?" Roger's voice grew bitter. "Maybe
that clears up a few things for you. Like why I never
missed on an exam. I never missed because I've lived
with Academy textbooks since I was old enough to
read. Or why I wanted the radar deck instead of the
control deck. I didn't want to have to make a decision!
My father had to make a decision once. As skipper and
pilot of the ship he decided to save a crewman's life.
He died saving a bum, a no good space-crawling rat!"</p>

<p>Tom and Astro sat stupefied at Roger's bitter tirade.
He turned away from them and gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"I've lived with only one idea in my head since I was
big enough to know why other kids had fathers to play
ball with them and I didn't. To get into the Academy,
get the training and then get out and cash in! Other
kids had fathers. All I had was a lousy hunk of gold,
worth exactly five hundred credits! A Solar Medal. And
my mother! Trying to scrape by on a lousy pension that
was only enough to keep us going, but not enough to
get me the extra things other kids had. It couldn't bring
back my father!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"That night&mdash;in Galaxy Hall, when you were crying&mdash;?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"So eavesdropping is one of your talents too, eh, Corbett?"
asked Roger sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Now, wait a minute, Roger," said Astro, getting up.</p>

<p>"Stay out of this, Astro!" snapped Roger. He paused
and looked back at Tom. "Remember that night on the
monorail going into Atom City? That man Bernard
who bought dinner for us? He was a boyhood friend of
my father's. He didn't recognize me, and I didn't tell
him who I was because I didn't want you space creeps
to know that much about me. And remember, when I
gave Al James the brush in that restaurant in Atom
City? He was talking about the old days, and he might
have spilled the beans too. It all adds up, doesn't it?
I had a reason I told you and it's just this! To make
Space Academy pay me back! To train me to be one of
the best astrogators in the universe so I could go into
commercial ships and pile up credits! Plenty of credits
and have a good life, and be sure my mother had a
good life&mdash;what's left of it. And the whole thing goes
right back to when my father made the decision to let
a space rat live, and die in his place! So leave me alone
with your last big efforts&mdash;and grandstand play for
glory. From now on, keep your big fat mouth shut!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know what to say, Roger," began Tom.</p>

<p>"Don't try to say anything, Tom," said Astro. There
was a coldness in his voice that made Tom turn around
and stare questioningly at the big Venusian.</p>

<p>"You can't answer him because you came from a
good home. With a mom and pop and brother and sister.
You had it good. You were lucky, but I don't hold
it against you because you had a nice life and I didn't."
Astro continued softly, "You can't answer Mr. Hot-shot
Manning, but I can!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Tom.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean that Manning doesn't know what it is to
really have it tough!"</p>

<p>"You got a <i>real</i> hard luck story, eh, big boy?" snarled
Roger.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I have!" growled Astro. "I got one that'll make
your life look like a spaceman's dream. At least you
<i>know</i> about your father. And you lived with your
mother. I didn't have <i>anything&mdash;nothing</i>! Did you hear
that, Manning? I didn't even have a pair of shoes, until
I found a kid at the Venusport spaceport one day and
figured his shoes would fit me. I beat the space gas out
of him and took his shoes. And then they were so tight,
they hurt my feet. I don't know who my father was,
nothing about him, except that he was a spaceman. A
rocket buster, like me. And my mother? She died when
I was born. Since I can remember, I've been on my
own. When I was twelve, I was hanging around the
spaceport day and night. I learned to buck rockets by
going aboard when the ships were cradled for repairs,
running dry runs, going through the motions, I talked
to spacemen&mdash;all who would listen to me. I lied about
my age, and because I was a big kid, I was blasting off
when I was fifteen. What little education I've got, I
picked up listening to the crew talk on long hops and
listening to every audioslide I could get my hands on.
I've had it tough. And because I <i>have</i> had it tough, I
want to forget about it. I don't want to be reminded
what it's like to be so hungry that I'd go out into jungles
and trap small animals and take a chance on meeting
a tyrannosaurus. So lay off that stuff about feeling
sorry for yourself. And about Tom being a hero, because
with all your space gas you still can't take it! And
if you don't want to fight to live, then go lie down in
the corner and just keep your big mouth shut!"</p>

<p>Tom stood staring at the big cadet. His head jutted
forward from his shoulders, the veins in his neck standing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>out like thick cords. He knew Astro had been an
orphan, but he had never suspected the big cadet's life
had been anything like that which he had just described.</p>

<p>Roger had stood perfectly still while Astro spoke.
Now, as the big cadet walked back to the hatch and
nervously began to examine the edges with his finger
tips, Roger walked over and stood behind him.</p>

<p>"Well, you knuckle-headed orphan," said Roger, "are
you going to get us out of here, or not?"</p>

<p>Astro whirled around, his face grim, his hands balled
into fists, ready to fight. "What's that, Mann&mdash;?" He
stopped. Roger was smiling and holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Whether you like it or not, you poor little waif,
you've just made yourself a friend."</p>

<p>Tom came up to them and leaned against the door
casually. "When you two stop gawking at each other
like long-lost brothers," he said lazily, "suppose we try
to figure a way out of this dungeon."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_19" id="CHAPTER_19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

<p>"Tom&mdash;Roger!" shouted Astro. "I think I've got it!"</p>

<p>Astro, on his knees, pulled a long file blade away
from the hatch and jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Did you cut all the way through?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;at least I'm not sure," Astro replied,
looking down at the hole he had made in the hatch.
"But let's give it a try!"</p>

<p>"Think we can force it back enough to get a good
hold on it?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"We'll know in a minute, Roger," said Astro. "Get
that steel bar over there and I'll try to slip it in between
the hatch and the bulkhead."</p>

<p>Roger rummaged around in the jumble of broken
parts and tools on the opposite side of the power deck
and found the steel bar Astro wanted. After several
attempts to force the hatch open had proven futile,
Tom suggested that they try to file the hinges off the
hatch, and then attempt to slide it sideways. After
much effort, and working in shifts, they had filed
through the three hinges, and now were ready to make
a last desperate attempt to escape. Astro took the steel
bar from Roger and jammed it between the bulkhead
wall and the hatch.</p>

<p>"No telling what we'll find on the other side," said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>Astro. "If the sand has covered up the ship all the way
down to here, then we'll never get out!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't we tunnel through it to the top, if it has
filled the ship down as far as here?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Not through this stuff," said Tom. "It's just like
powder."</p>

<p>"Tom's right," said Astro. "As soon as you dig into it,
it'll fall right back in on you." He paused and looked
at the hatch thoughtfully. "No. The only way we can
get out of here is if the sand was only blown into the
deck outside and hasn't filled the rest of the ship."</p>

<p>"Only one way to find out," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Roger. "Let's get that hatch shoved
aside and take a look."</p>

<p>Astro jammed the heavy steel bar farther into the
space between the hatch and the bulkhead, and then
turned back to his unit-mates.</p>

<p>"Get that piece of pipe over there," he said. "We'll
slip it over the end of the bar and that'll give us more
leverage."</p>

<p>Tom and Roger scrambled after the length of pipe,
slipped it over the end of the bar, and then, holding it
at either end, began to apply even pressure against the
hatch.</p>

<p>Gradually, a half inch at a time, the heavy steel
hatch began to move sideways, sliding out and behind
the bulkhead. And as the opening grew larger the fine
powderlike sand began to fall into the power deck.</p>

<p>"Let's move it back about a foot and a half," said
Tom. "That'll give us plenty of room to get through
and see what's on the other side."</p>

<p>Astro and Roger nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Once more the three boys exerted their strength
against the pipe and applied pressure to the hatch.
Slowly, grudgingly it moved back, until there was an
eighteen-inch opening, exposing a solid wall of the desert
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>sand. Suddenly, as if released by a hidden switch,
the sand began to pour into the power deck.</p>

<p>"Watch out!" shouted Tom. The three boys jumped
back and looked on in dismay as the sand came rushing
through the opening. Gradually it slowed to a stop and
the pile in front of the opening rose as high as the
hatch itself.</p>

<p>"That does it," said Tom. "Now we've got to dig
through and find out how deep that stuff is. And spacemen,
between you and me, I hope it doesn't prove too
deep!"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking, Tom," said Roger, "suppose it's
as high as the upper decks outside? All we have to do
is keep digging it out and spreading it around the
power deck here until we can get through."</p>

<p>"Only one thing wrong with that idea, Roger," said
Tom. "If the whole upper part of the ship is flooded
with that stuff, we won't have enough room to spread
it around."</p>

<p>"We could always open the reaction chamber and
fill that," suggested Astro, indicating the hatch in the
floor of the power deck that lead to the reactant chamber.</p>

<p>"I'd just as soon take my chances with sand," said
Roger, "as risk opening that hatch. The chamber is still
hot from the wildcatting reaction mass we had to
dump back in space."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let's start digging," said Tom. He picked
up an empty grease bucket and began filling it with
sand.</p>

<p>"You two get busy loading them, and I'll dump,"
said Astro.</p>

<p>"O.K.," replied Tom and continued digging into the
sand with his hands.</p>

<p>"Here, use this, Tom," said Roger, offering an empty
Martian water container.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly, the three cadets worked their way through
the pile on the deck in front of the hatch opening and
then started on the main pile in the opening itself. But
as soon as they made a little progress on the main pile,
the sand would fall right in again from the open hatch,
and after two hours of steady work, the sand in front
of the hatch still filled the entire opening. Their work
had been all for nothing. They sat down for a rest.</p>

<p>"Let's try it a little higher up, Tom," suggested
Roger. "Maybe this stuff isn't as deep as we think."</p>

<p>Tom nodded and stepped up, feeling around the top
of the opening. He began clawing at the sand overhead.
The sand still came pouring through the opening.</p>

<p>"See anything?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know&mdash;" spluttered Tom as the sand slid
down burying him to his waist.</p>

<p>"Better back up, Tom," warned Roger. "Might be a
cave-in and you'll get buried."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" shouted Tom. "I think I see something!"</p>

<p>"A light?" asked Astro eagerly.</p>

<p>"Careful, Tom," warned Roger again.</p>

<p>Tom clawed at the top of the pile, ignoring the sand
that was heaped around him.</p>

<p>"I've got it," shouted Tom, struggling back into the
power deck just in time to avoid being buried under a
sudden avalanche. "There's another hatch up there,
just behind the ladder that leads into the passenger
lounge. That's the side facing the storm! And as soon as
we dig a little, the sand falls from that pile. But the
opposite side, leading to the jet-boat deck, is free and
clear!"</p>

<p>"Then all we have to do is force our way through to
the top," said Astro.</p>

<p>"That's all," said Tom. "We'd be here until doomsday
digging our way clear."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"I get it!" said Roger. "The storm filled up the side
of the ship facing that way, and that is where the passenger
lounge is. I remember now. I left the hatch open
when we came down here to the power deck, so the
sand just kept pouring in." He smiled sheepishly. "I
guess it's all my fault."</p>

<p>"Never mind that now!" said Tom. "Take this hose
and stick it in your mouth, Astro. Breath through your
mouth and plug up your nose so you won't get it all
stopped up with sand while you pull your way
through."</p>

<p>"I'll take this rope with me too," said Astro. "That
way I can help pull you guys up after me."</p>

<p>"Good idea," said Roger.</p>

<p>"As soon as you get outside the hatch here," said
Tom, "turn back this way. Keep your face up against
the bulkhead until you get to the top. Right above you
is the ladder. You can grab it to pull yourself up."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/im195.png" width="400" height="300" alt="im195" title="" /></div>

<p>"O.K.," said Astro and took the length of hose and put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
it in his mouth. Then, taking a piece of waste cotton,
he stopped up his nose and tested the hose.</p>

<p>"Can you breathe O.K.?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>Astro signaled that he could and stepped through the
hatch. He turned, and facing backward, began clawing
his way upward.</p>

<p>"Keep that hose clear, Roger!" ordered Tom. "There's
about five feet of sand that he has to dig through and if
any of it gets into the hose&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Tom," interrupted Roger. "I've got the
end of the hose right next to the oxygen bottle. He's
getting pure stuff!"</p>

<p>Soon the big cadet was lost to view. Only the slow
movement of the hose and rope indicated that Astro was
all right. Finally the hose and rope stopped moving.</p>

<p>Tom and Roger looked at each other, worried.</p>

<p>"You think something might be wrong?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;" Roger caught himself. "Say, look&mdash;the
rope! It's jerking&mdash;Astro's signaling!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/im196.png" width="400" height="301" alt="im196" title="" />

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"He made it!" cried Tom.</p>

<p>"I wonder if&mdash;" Roger suddenly picked up the end
of the hose and spoke into it. "Astro? Hey, Astro, can
you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Sure I can." Astro's voice came back through the
hose. "Don't shout so loud! I'm not on Earth, you know.
I'm just ten feet above you!"</p>

<p>Roger and Tom clapped each other on the shoulders
in glee.</p>

<p>"All set down there?" called Astro, through the hose.</p>

<p>"O.K." replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Astro, "when you get outside the
hatch, you'll find a pipe running along the bulkhead
right over your head. Grab that and pull yourself up.
Tie the rope around your shoulder, but leave enough of
it so the next guy can come up. We don't have any way
of getting it back down there!" he warned. "Who's
coming up first?"</p>

<p>Tom looked at Roger.</p>

<p>"You're stronger, Tom," said Roger. "You go up now
and then you can give Astro a hand pulling me
through."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Tom. He began pulling the hose
back through the sand. He took the end, cleared it out
with a few blasts from the oxygen bottle and put it in
his mouth. Then, after Roger had helped him tie the
rope around his shoulders, he stuffed his nose with the
waste cotton. He stepped to the opening. Roger gave
three quick jerks on the rope and Astro started hauling
in.</p>

<p>With Astro's help, Tom was soon free and clear,
standing beside Astro on the jet-boat deck.</p>

<p>"Phoooeeeey!" said Tom, spitting out the sand that
had filtered into his mouth. "I never want to do that
again!" He dusted himself off and flashed his emergency
light around the deck. "Look at that!" he said in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>amazement. "If we'd kept on digging, we'd have been
trapped down there for&mdash;" he paused and looked at
Astro who was grinning&mdash;"a long, long time!" He held
the light on the sand that was flowing out of the open
hatch of the passenger lounge.</p>

<p>"Come on," urged Astro. "Let's get Roger out of
there!"</p>

<p>They called to Roger through the hose and told him
to bring two more emergency lights and the remainder
of the Martian water. Three minutes later the <i>Polaris</i>
unit was together again.</p>

<p>Standing on the deck beside his two unit-mates,
Roger brushed himself off and smiled. "Well," he said,
"looks like we made it!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Tom, "but take a look at this!" He
walked across the jet-boat deck to the nearest window
port. What should have been a clear view of the desert
was a mass of solidly packed sand.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried Roger. "Don't tell me we have to go
through that again?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it'll be so bad this time," said Astro.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"The sand is banked the heaviest on the port side of
the ship. And the window ports on the starboard side
of the control deck were pretty high off the ground."</p>

<p>"Well, let's not just stand here and talk about it," said
Roger. "Let's take a look!" He turned and walked
through the jet-boat deck.</p>

<p>Tom and Astro followed the blond cadet through the
darkened passages of the dead ship, and after digging a
small pile of sand away from the control-deck hatch,
found themselves once more amid the jumble of the
wrecked instruments.</p>

<p>For the first time in three days, the boys saw sunlight
streaking through the crystal port.</p>

<p>"I told you," cried Astro triumphantly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"But there still isn't any way out of this place!" said
Roger. "We can't break that port. It's six inches thick!"</p>

<p>"Find me a wrench," said Astro. "I can take the
whole window port apart from inside. How do you
think they replace these things when they get
cracked?"</p>

<p>Hurriedly searching through the rubble, Tom finally
produced a wrench and handed it to Astro. In a half
hour Astro had taken the whole section down and had
pushed the crystal outward. The air of the desert
rushed into the control room in a hot blast.</p>

<p>"Whew!" cried Roger. "It must be at least a hundred
and twenty-five degrees out there!"</p>

<p>"Come on. Let's take a look," said Tom. "And keep
your fingers crossed!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"That we can dig enough of the sand away from the
ship to make it recognizable from the air."</p>

<p>Following Tom's lead, Roger and Astro climbed
through the open port and out onto the sand.</p>

<p>"Well, blast my jets!" said Astro. "You can't even tell
there was a storm."</p>

<p>"You can't if you don't look at the ship," said Tom
bitterly. "That was the only thing around here of any
size that would offer resistance to the sand and make
it pile up. And, spaceman, look at that pile!"</p>

<p>Astro and Roger turned to look at the spaceship. Instead
of seeing the ship, they saw a small mountain of
sand, well over a hundred feet high. They walked
around it and soon discovered that the window port in
the control deck had been the only possible way out.</p>

<p>"Call it what you want," said Roger, "but I think it's
just plain dumb luck that we were able to get out!" He
eyed the mound of sand. Unless one knew there was a
spaceship beneath it, it would have been impossible
to distinguish it from the rest of the desert.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're not in the clear yet!" commented Astro
grimly. "It would take a hundred men at least a week
to clear away enough of that sand so search parties
could recognize it." He glanced toward the horizon.
"There isn't anything but sand here, fellows, sand that
stretches for a thousand miles in every direction."</p>

<p>"And we've got to walk it," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Either that or sit here and die of thirst," said Roger.</p>

<p>"Any canals around here, Tom?" asked Astro softly.</p>

<p>"There better be," replied Tom thoughtfully. He
turned to Roger. "If you can estimate our position,
Roger, I'll go back inside and see if I can find a chart
to plot it on. That way, we might get a direction to
start on at least."</p>

<p>Astro glanced up at the pale-blue sky. "It's going to
be a hot day," he said softly, looking out over the flat
plain of the desert, "an awful hot day!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_20" id="CHAPTER_20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

<p>"Got everything we need?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Everything we'll need&mdash;and about all we can safely
carry without weighing ourselves down too much," answered
Roger. "Enough food for a week, the rest of the
Martian water, space goggles to protect our eyes from
the sun and emergency lights for each of us."</p>

<p>"Not much to walk a hundred and fifty miles on,"
offered Astro. "Too bad the sand got in the galley and
messed up the rest of that good food."</p>

<p>"We'll have plenty to get us by&mdash;if my calculations
are right," said Tom. "One hundred and fifty-four miles
to be exact."</p>

<p>"<i>Exact</i> only as far as my sun sight told me," said
Roger.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's right?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I'll answer you this way," Roger replied. "I took
that sight six times in a half hour and got a mean average
on all of them that came out within a few miles of
each other. If I'm wrong, I'm very wrong, but if I'm
right, we're within three to five miles of the position I
gave you."</p>

<p>"That's good enough for me," said Astro. "If we're
going out there"&mdash;he pointed toward the desert&mdash;"instead
of sitting around here waiting for Strong or someone
to show up, then I'd just as soon go now!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait a minute, fellas. Let's get this straight," said
Tom. "We're all agreed that the odds on Captain
Strong's showing up here before our water runs out
are too great to risk it, and that we'll try to reach the
nearest canal. The most important thing in this place
is water. If we stay and the water we have runs out,
we're done for. If we go, we might not reach the canal&mdash;and
the chance of being spotted in the desert is even
smaller than if we wait here at the ship." He paused.
"So we move on?" He looked at the others. Astro
nodded and looked at Roger, who bobbed his head in
agreement.</p>

<p>"O.K., then," said Tom, "it's settled. We'll move at
night when it's cool, and try to rest during the day
when it's the hottest."</p>

<p>Roger looked up at the blazing white sphere in the
pale-blue sky that burned down relentlessly. "I figure
we have about six hours before she drops for the day,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Then let's go back inside the ship and get some
rest," he said.</p>

<p>Without another word, the three cadets climbed
back inside the ship and made places for themselves
amid the littered deck of the control room. A hot wind
blew out of the New Sahara through the open port like
a breath of fire. Stripped to their shorts, the three boys
lay around the deck unable to sleep, each thinking
quietly about the task ahead, each remembering stories
of the early pioneers who first reached Mars. In the
mad rush for the uranium-yielding pitchblende, they
had swarmed over the deserts toward the dwarf
mountains by the thousands. Greedy, thinking only of
the fortunes that could be torn from the rugged little
mountains, they had come unprepared for the heat of
the Martian deserts and nine out of ten had never returned.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Each boy thought, too, of the dangers they had just
faced. This new danger was different. This was something
that couldn't be defeated with an idea or a sudden
lucky break. This danger was ever present&mdash;a fight
against nature, man against the elements on an alien
planet. It was a battle of endurance that would wring
the last drop of moisture mercilessly from the body, until
it became a dry, brittle husk.</p>

<p>"Getting pretty close to sundown," said Tom finally.
He stood beside the open port and shielded his eyes
from the glare of the sun, now slowly sinking below the
Martian horizon.</p>

<p>"I guess we'd better get going," said Roger. "All set,
Astro?"</p>

<p>"Ready, Roger," answered the Venusian.</p>

<p>The three boys dressed and arranged the food packs
on their backs. Tom carried the remainder of the Martian
water, two quart plastic containers, and a six-yard
square of space cloth, an extremely durable flyweight
fabric that would serve as protection from the sun during
the rest stop of the day. Roger and Astro carried
the food in compact packs on their backs. Each boy
wore a makeshift hat of space cloth, along with space
goggles, a clear sheet of colored plastic that fitted
snugly across the face. All three carried emergency
lights salvaged from the wrecked ship.</p>

<p>Tom walked out away from the ship several hundred
yards and studied his pocket compass. He held it
steady for a moment, watching the needle swing
around. He turned and walked slowly still watching
the needle of the compass. He waited for it to steady
again, then turned back to Roger and Astro who stood
watching from the window port.</p>

<p>"This is the way." Tom pointed away from the ship.
"Three degrees south of east, one hundred and fifty-four
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>miles away, if everything is correct, should bring
us smack on top of a major canal."</p>

<p>"So long, <i>Lady Venus</i>," said Astro, as he left the ship.</p>

<p>"Don't think it hasn't been fun," added Roger, "because
it hasn't!"</p>

<p>Astro fell in behind Roger, who in turn followed
Tom who walked some ten feet ahead. A light breeze
sprang up and blew across the surface of the powdery
sand. Ten minutes later, when they stopped to adjust
their shoulder packs, they looked back. The breeze had
obliterated their tracks and the mountain of sand covering
the spaceship appeared to be no different from any
of the other small dunes on the desert. The New Sahara
desert of Mars had claimed another Earth-ship victim.</p>

<p>"If we can't see the <i>Lady Venus</i> standing still, and
knowing where to look," said Astro, "how could a man
in a rocket scout ever find it?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't," said Roger flatly. "And when the
water ran out, we'd just be sitting there."</p>

<p>"We're losing time," said Tom. "Let's move." He
lengthened his stride through the soft sand that sucked
at his high space boots and faced the already dimming
horizon. The light breeze felt good on his face.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>The three cadets had no fear of running into anything
in their march through the darkness across the
shifting sands. And only an occasional flash of the
emergency light to check the compass was necessary
to keep them moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>There wasn't much talk. There wasn't much to talk
about. About nine o'clock the boys stopped and opened
one of the containers of food and ate a quick meal of
sandwiches. This was followed by a carefully measured
ounce of water, and fifteen minutes later they resumed
their march across the New Sahara.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>About ten o'clock, Deimos, one of the small twin
moons of Mars, swung up overhead, washing the desert
with a pale cold light. By morning, when the cherry-red
sun broke the line of the horizon, Tom estimated
that they had walked about twenty miles.</p>

<p>"Think we ought to camp here?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"If you can show me a better spot," said Roger with
a laugh, "I'll be happy to use it!" He swung his arm in
a wide circle, indicating a wasteland of sand that
spread as far as the eyes could see.</p>

<p>"I could go for another hour or so," said Astro, "before
it gets too hot."</p>

<p>"And wait for the heat to reach the top of the thermometer?
Uh-huh, not me," said Roger. "I'll take as
much sleep as I can get now&mdash;while it's still a little
cool."</p>

<p>"Roger's right," said Tom. "We'd better take it easy
now. We won't be able to get much sleep after noon."</p>

<p>"What do we do from noon until evening?" asked
Astro.</p>

<p>"Aside from just sitting under this hunk of space
cloth, I guess we'll come as close to being roasted alive
as a human can get."</p>

<p>"You want to eat now?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>Tom and Roger laughed. "I'm not hungry, but you
go ahead," said Tom. "I know that appetite of yours
won't wait."</p>

<p>"I'm not too hungry either," said Roger. "Go ahead,
you clobber-headed juice jockey."</p>

<p>Astro grinned sheepishly, and opening one of the
containers of food, quickly wolfed down a breakfast of
smoked Venusian fatfish.</p>

<p>Tom and Roger began spreading the space cloth on
the sand that was already hot to the touch. Anchoring
the four corners in the sand with the emergency lights
and one of Tom's boots, they propped up the center with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>the food packs, one on top of the other. A crude tent
was the result and both boys crawled in under, sprawling
on the sand. Astro finished eating, lay down beside
his two unit-mates, and in a moment the three cadets
were sound asleep.</p>

<p>The sun climbed steadily over the desert while the
<i>Polaris</i> unit slept. With each hour, the heat of the desert
rose, climbing past the hundred mark, reaching one
hundred and twenty, then one hundred and thirty-five
degrees.</p>

<p>Tom woke up with a start. He felt as if he were inside
a blazing furnace. He rolled over and saw Astro
and Roger still asleep, sweat pouring off them in
small rivulets. He started to wake them, but decided
against it and just lay still under the thin sheet of space
cloth that protected him from the sun. As light as the
fabric square was, weighing no more than a pound,
under the intense heat of the sun it felt like a woolen
blanket where it touched him. Astro rolled over and
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"What time is it, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Must be about noon. How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure yet. I had a dream." The big cadet
rubbed his eyes and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
"I dreamed I was being shoved into an oven&mdash;like
Hansel and Gretel in that old fairy tale."</p>

<p>"Personally," mumbled Roger, without opening his
eyes, "I'll take Hansel and Gretel. They might be a little
more tender."</p>

<p>"I could do with a drink," said Astro, looking at Tom.</p>

<p>Tom hesitated. He felt that as hot as it was, it would
get still hotter and there had to be strict control of the
remainder of the water.</p>

<p>"Try to hold out a little longer, Astro," said Tom.
"This heat hasn't really begun yet. You could drink the
whole thing and still want more."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right, Astro," said Roger, sitting up. "Best
thing to do is just wet your tongue and lips a little.
Drinking won't do much good now."</p>

<p>"O.K. by me," said Astro. "Well, what do we do
now?"</p>

<p>"We sit here and we wait," answered Tom. He sat
up and held the space cloth up on his side.</p>

<p>"You get in the middle, Astro," suggested Roger.
"Your head is up higher than mine and Tom's. You can
be the tent pole under this big top."</p>

<p>Astro grunted and changed places with the smaller
cadet.</p>

<p>"Think there might be a breeze if we opened up one
side of this thing?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"If there was a breeze," answered Tom, "it'd be so
hot, it'd be worse than what we've got inside."</p>

<p>"It sure is going to be a hot day," said Astro softly.</p>

<p>The thin fabric of the space cloth was enough to protect
them from the direct rays of the sun, but offered
very little protection against the heat. Soon the inside
of the tent was boiling under the relentless sun.</p>

<p>They sat far apart, their knees pulled up, heads
bowed. Once when the heat seemed unbearable, Tom
opened one side of the cloth in a desperate hope that
it might be a little cooler outside. A blast of hot air
entered the makeshift tent and he quickly closed the
opening.</p>

<p>About three o'clock Roger suddenly slipped backward
and lay sprawled on the sand.</p>

<p>Tom opened one of the containers of water and
dipped his shirttail into it. Astro watched him moisten
Roger's lips and wipe his temples. In a few moments
the cadet stirred and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know what happened," he said slowly.
"Everything started swimming and then went black."</p>

<p>"You fainted," said Tom simply.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Sun should be dropping soon now, in another
couple of hours."</p>

<p>They were silent again. The sun continued its journey
across the sky and at last began to slip behind the
horizon. When the last red rays stretched across the
sandy desert, the three cadets folded back the space-cloth
covering and stood up. A soft evening breeze
sprang up, refreshing them a little, and though none of
them was hungry, each boy ate a light meal.</p>

<p>Tom opened the container of water again and measured
out about an ounce apiece.</p>

<p>"Moisten your tongue, and sip it slowly," ordered
Tom.</p>

<p>Roger and Astro took their share of the water and
dipped fingers in it, wiping their lips and eyelids. They
continued to do this until finally, no longer able to resist,
they took the precious water and swished it around
in their mouths before swallowing it.</p>

<p>They folded the space cloth, shouldered their packs,
and after Tom had checked the compass, started their
long march toward their plotted destination.</p>

<p>They had survived their first twenty-four hours in
the barren wastes of the New Sahara, with each boy
acutely aware that there was at least a week more of
the same in front of them. The sky blackened, and soon
after Deimos rose and started climbing across the
dark sky.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_21" id="CHAPTER_21"></a>CHAPTER 21</h2>

<p>"How much water left?" asked Astro thickly.</p>

<p>"Enough for one more drink apiece," Tom replied.</p>

<p>"And then what happens?" mumbled Roger through
his cracked lips.</p>

<p>"You know what will happen, Roger&mdash;you know and
I know and Tom knows," muttered Astro grimly.</p>

<p>For eight days they had been struggling across the
blistering shifting sands, walking by night, sweltering
under the thin space cloth during the day. Their
tongues were swollen. Scraggly beards covered their
chins and jaws. Roger's lips were cracked. The back of
Tom's neck had suffered ten minutes of direct sun and
turned into a large swollen blister. Only Astro appeared
to be bearing up under the ordeal. There was no sign
of their being close to the canal.</p>

<p>"Wanta try marching during the day?" asked Astro.
They had broken camp on the evening of the eighth
day and were preparing to move on into the never-changing
desert.</p>

<p>"If we don't hit the canal sometime during the night,
there might be a chance it's close enough to reach in a
couple of hours," replied Tom. "Either that, or we've
miscalculated altogether."</p>

<p>"How about you, Roger?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Whatever you guys decide, I'll be right in back of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>you." Roger had grown steadily weaker during the last
three days and found it difficult to sleep during the
hours of rest.</p>

<p>"Then we'll keep marching tomorrow," said Astro.</p>

<p>"Let's move out," said Tom. Roger and Astro shouldered
the remaining slender food packs, with Tom carrying
the water and space cloth, and they started out
into the rapidly darkening desert.</p>

<p>Once again, as on the previous eight nights, the little
moon, Deimos, swung across the sky, casting dim shadows
ahead of the three marching boys. Tom found it
necessary to look at the compass more often. He
couldn't trust his sense of direction as much as he had
earlier. Once, he had gone for two hours in a direction
that was fifty degrees off course. The rest stops also
were more frequent now, with each boy throwing his
pack to the ground and lying flat on his back, to enjoy
the cool breeze that never failed to soothe their
scorched faces.</p>

<p>When the sun rose out of the desert on the morning
of the ninth day, they stopped, ate a light breakfast of
preserved figs, divided the juice evenly among them,
and, ripping the space cloth into three sections,
wrapped it around themselves like Arabs and continued
to walk.</p>

<p>By noon, with the sun directly overhead, they were
staggering. At two-thirty the sun and the heat were so
overpowering that they stopped involuntarily and tried
to sit on the hot sand only to find that they couldn't and
so they stumbled on.</p>

<p>Neither Roger nor Astro asked for water. Finally
Tom stopped and faced his two unit-mates wobbling
on unsteady legs.</p>

<p>"I've gone as far as I can without water. I&mdash;I don't
think I can go another step. So come on, we'll finish
what we've got."

<p>Astro and Roger nodded in quiet agreement. They
watched with dull eyes as Tom carefully opened the
plastic container of water. He gave each a cup and
slowly, cautiously, measured out the remaining water
into three equal parts. He held the container up for a
full minute allowing the last drop to run out before
tossing the empty bottle to one side.</p>

<p>"Here goes," said Tom. He wet his lips, placed a wet
finger on his temples and sipped the liquid slowly, allowing
it to trickle down his parched throat.</p>

<p>Roger and Astro did the same. After he had wet his
lips, Astro took the full amount in his mouth and washed
it around, before swallowing it. Roger brought the cup
up slowly to his mouth with trembling hands, tipped it
shakily, and then before Astro or Tom could catch him,
fell to the ground. The precious water spilled into the
sand.</p>

<p>Tom and Astro watched dumfounded as the dry
sand sucked away the water until nothing remained
but a damp spot six inches wide.</p>

<p>"I guess&mdash;" began Tom, "I guess that about does it!"</p>

<p>"We'll have to carry him," said Astro simply.</p>

<p>Tom looked up into the eyes of his unit-mate. There
he saw a determination that would not be defeated. He
nodded his head and stooped over to grapple with Roger's
legs. He got one leg under each arm and then tried
to straighten up. He fell to the sand and rolled to one
side. Astro watched him get up slowly, wearily, his
space-cloth covering remaining on the ground, and
then, with gritted teeth, try once more to pick Roger's
legs up.</p>

<p>Astro put out his hand and touched Tom on the
shoulder. His voice was low, hardly above a whisper.
"You lead the way, Tom. I'll carry him."</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom looked up at the big Venusian. Their eyes
locked for a moment and then he nodded his head and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
turned away. He pulled out the pocket compass and
through blurred vision read the course beneath its wavering
needle. He waved an arm in a direction to the
right of them and staggered off.</p>

<p>Astro stooped down, picked Roger up in his arms and
slowly got him across his shoulders. Then steadying
himself, he walked after Tom.</p>

<p>Suddenly a blast of wind, hot as fire, swept across the
sandy plains, whipping the sand up and around the two
walking figures, biting into exposed hands and faces.
Tom tried to adjust his goggles when the sand began to
penetrate around the edges but his fingers shook and
he dropped them. In a flash, the sand drove into his
eyes, blinding him.</p>

<p>"I can't see, Astro," said Tom in a hoarse whisper
when Astro staggered up. "You'll have to guide."</p>

<p>Astro took the compass out of Tom's hand and then
placed his unit-mate's hand on his back. Tom gripped
the loose folds of the space cloth and uniform beneath
and struggled blindly after the big cadet.</p>

<p>The hot sun bore down. The wind kept blowing and
Astro, with Roger slung across his back like a sack of
potatoes and Tom clinging blindly to his uniform,
walked steadily on.</p>

<p>He felt each step would be his last, but with each
step he told himself through gritted teeth that he
could do ten more&mdash;and then ten more&mdash;ten more.</p>

<p>He walked, he staggered, and once he fell to the
ground, Tom slumping behind him and Roger being
tossed limply to the scorching sand. Slowly Astro recovered,
helped Tom to his feet, then with the last of
his great strength, picked up Roger again. This time,
he was unable to get him to his shoulder so he carried
him like a baby in his arms.</p>

<p>At last the sun began to drop in the red sky. Astro
felt Roger's limp body slipping from his grip. By now,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>Tom had lost all but the very last ounce of his strength
and was simply being pulled along.</p>

<p>"Tom&mdash;" gasped Astro with great effort, "I'm going
to count to a thousand and then&mdash;I'm going to stop."</p>

<p>Tom didn't answer.</p>

<p>Astro began to count. "One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;"
He tried to make each number become a
step forward. He closed his eyes. It wasn't important
which way he went. It was only important that he walk
those thousand steps, "five hundred eleven&mdash;five
hundred twelve&mdash;five hundred thirteen&mdash;"</p>

<p>Involuntarily he opened his eyes when he felt himself
climbing up a small rise in the sand. He opened his
eyes and ten feet away was the flat blue surface of the
canal they had been searching for.</p>

<p>"You can let go now, Tom," said Astro in a voice
hardly above a whisper. "We made it. We're on the
bank of the canal."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Hey, Roger," yelled Astro from the middle of the
canal, "ever see a guy make like a submarine?"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger sat on the top of the low bank of the
canal drying off from a swim, while Astro still splashed
around luxuriating in the cool water.</p>

<p>"Go on," yelled Roger, "let's see you drown yourself!"</p>

<p>"Not me, hot-shot," yelled Astro. "After that walk, all
I'd have to do is open my mouth and start drinking."</p>

<p>Finally tiring of his sport, the big Venusian pulled
himself up onto the bank of the canal and quickly
dressed. Pulling on his space boots, he turned to Tom
and Roger, who were breaking out the last two containers
of food.</p>

<p>"You know, Astro," said Roger quietly, "I'll never be
able to repay you for carrying me."</p>

<p>Tom was quiet for a moment, and then added, "Same
here, Astro."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Astro grinned from ear to ear. "Answer me this one
question, both of you. Would you have done it for me?"</p>

<p>The two boys nodded.</p>

<p>"Then you paid me. As long as I know I'm backed
up by two guys like you, then I'm paid. Carrying you,
Roger, was just something I could do for you at that
particular time. One of these days, when we get out of
this oven, there'll come a time when you or Tom will
do something for me&mdash;and that's the way it should be."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Astro," said Roger. He reached over and
put his hand on top of Astro's, and then Tom placed
his hand on top of theirs. The three boys were quiet for
a moment. There was an understanding in each of them
that they had accomplished more than just survival in
a desert. They had learned to respect each other. They
were a unit at last.</p>

<p>"What do we do next?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Start walking that way," said Tom, pointing to his
left along the bank of the canal that stretched off in a
straight line to the very horizon. "If we're lucky, we
might be able to find something to use as a raft and
then we can ride."</p>

<p>"Think there are any fish in this canal?" asked Astro,
gazing out over the cool blue water.</p>

<p>"Doubt it. At least I've never heard of there being
any," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Well," said Roger, standing up, "you can go a lot
farther without food than you can without water. And
we still have that big container of ham left."</p>

<p>"Yeah, as soon as it gets hot, we just swim instead of
walk," said Astro. "And, believe me, there's going to be
a lot of swimming done!"</p>

<p>"Think we might strike anything down that way,"
asked Roger. He looked down the canal in the direction
Tom had indicated.</p>

<p>"That's the direction of the nearest atmosphere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>booster station. At least that was the way it looked on
the chart. All of them were built near the canals."</p>

<p>"How far away do you think it is?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Must be at least three hundred miles."</p>

<p>"Let's start moving," said Roger, "and hope we can
find something that'll float us on the canal."</p>

<p>Single file, wearing the space cloths once more as
protection against the sun, they walked along the bank
of the canal. When the heat became unbearable, they
dipped the squares of space cloths into the water and
wrapped themselves in them. When they began to dry
out, they would repeat the process. At noon, when the
sun dried the fabric nearly as fast as they could wet it,
they stopped and slipped over the edge of the bank into
the cool water. Covering their heads with the cloths they
remained partly submerged until the late afternoon.
When the sun had lost some of its power, again they
climbed out and continued walking.</p>

<p>Marching late into the night, they made camp beside
the canal, finished the last container of food, and, for the
first time since leaving the ship, slept during the night.
By the time Deimos had risen in the sky, they were
sound asleep.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_22" id="CHAPTER_22"></a>CHAPTER 22</h2>

<p>"Eeeeeeoooooooow!" Astro's bull-like roar shattered the
silence of the desert. "There&mdash;up ahead, Tom&mdash;Roger&mdash;a
building!"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger stopped and strained their eyes in
the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>"I think you're right," said Tom at last. "But I doubt
if anyone's there. Looks like an abandoned mining
shack to me."</p>

<p>"Who wants to stand here and debate the question?"
asked Roger, and started off down the side of the canal
at a lope, with Astro and Tom right behind him.</p>

<p>During the last three days the boys had been living
off the contents of the last remaining food container
and the few lichens they found growing along the canal.
Their strength was weakening, but with an abundant
supply of water near at hand and able to combat
the sun's heat with frequent swims, they were still in
fair condition.</p>

<p>Tom was the first to reach the building, a one-story
structure made of dried mud from the canal. The shutters
and the door had long since been torn away by
countless sandstorms.</p>

<p>The three boys entered the one-room building cautiously.
The floor was covered with sand, and sand was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>piled in heaping drifts in front of the open windows
and door.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;not a thing," said Roger disgustedly.
"This place must be at least a hundred and fifty years
old."</p>

<p>"Probably built by a miner," commented Tom.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'nothing'?" said Astro. "Look!"</p>

<p>They followed Astro's pointing finger to the ceiling.
Crisscrossed, from wall to wall, were heavy wooden
beams.</p>

<p>"Raft!" Tom cried.</p>

<p>"That's right, spaceman," said Astro, "a raft. There's
enough wood up there to float the <i>Polaris</i>. Come
on!"</p>

<p>Astro hurried outside, with Tom and Roger following
at his heels. They quickly climbed to the roof of the old
building and soon were ripping the beams from the
crumbling mud. Fortunately the beams had been
joined by notching the ends of the crosspieces. Astro
explained that this was necessary because of the premium
on nails when the house was built. Everything at
that time had to be hauled from Earth, and no one
wanted to pay the price heavy nails and bolts demanded.</p>

<p>One by one, they removed the heavy beams, until
they had eight of them lined up alongside the edge of
the canal.</p>

<p>"How do we keep them together?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"With this!" said Tom. He began ripping his space
cloth into long strips. Astro and Roger tugged at the
first beam. At last they had it in the water.</p>

<p>"It floats," cried Astro. Tom and Roger couldn't help
but shout for joy. They quickly hauled the remaining
beams into the water and lashed them together. Without
hesitation, they shoved the raft into the canal,
climbing aboard and standing like conquering heroes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>as the raft moved out into the main flow of the canal
and began to drift forward.</p>

<p>"I dub thee&mdash;<i>Polaris the Second</i>," said Tom in formal
tones and gave the nearest beam a kick.</p>

<p>Astro and Roger gave a lusty cheer.</p>

<p>Steadily, silently, the raft bore them through the
never-changing scene of the canal's muddy banks and
the endlessness of the desert beyond.</p>

<p>Protecting themselves from the sun during the day
by repeated dunkings in the water, they traveled day
and night in a straight course down the center of the
canal. At night, the tiny moon, Deimos, climbed across
the desert and reflected light upon the satin-smooth
water.</p>

<p>The third day on the raft they began to feel the
pangs of hunger. And where during their march
through the desert, their thoughts were of water, now
visions of endless tables of food occupied their
thoughts. At first, they talked of their hunger, dreaming
up wild combinations of dishes and giving even
wilder estimates of how much each could consume. Finally,
discovering that talking about it only intensified
their desire, they kept a stolid silence. When the heat
became unbearable, they simply took to the water. Once
Tom's grip on the raft slipped and Roger plunged in
after him without a moment's hesitation, only to have
Astro go in to save both of them.</p>

<p>On and on&mdash;down the canal, the three boys floated.
Days turned into nights, and nights, cooling and refreshing,
gave way to the blazing sun of the next day.
The silent desert swept past them.</p>

<p>One night, when Astro, unable to sleep, was staring
ahead into the darkness, he heard a rustling in the water
alongside the raft. He moved slowly to the edge of
the raft and peered down into the clear water.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw a fish!</p>

<p>The big cadet watched it dart around the raft. He
waited, his body tense. Once the fish came to the edge
of the raft, but before Astro could move his arm, it
darted off in another direction.</p>

<p>At last the fish disappeared and Astro sank back on
the timbers. He trailed one hand over the side in the water,
and suddenly, felt the rough scales of the fish brush
his fingers. In a flash, Astro closed his hand and
snatched the wriggling creature out of the water.</p>

<p>"Tom&mdash;Roger&mdash;" he shouted. "Look&mdash;look&mdash;a fish&mdash;I
caught a fish with my bare hands!"</p>

<p>Tom rolled over and opened his eyes. Roger sat in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I watched him&mdash;I was watching him and then he
went away. And then I held my hand over the side of
the raft and he came snooping around and&mdash;well, I just
grabbed him!"</p>

<p>He held the fish in the viselike grip of his right hand
until it stopped moving.</p>

<p>"You know," said Tom weakly, "I just remembered.
When we were in the Science Building in Atom City,
one of their projects was to breed both Earth and Venus
fish in the canals."</p>

<p>"I am going to shake, personally, the hand of the man
who started this project when we get back to Atom
City," said Astro.</p>

<p>Suddenly Roger gripped Tom's arms. He was staring
in the direction the raft was going. "Tom&mdash;" he
breathed, "Astro&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>They turned and peered into the dusk. In the distance,
not a mile away, was the huge crystal-clear
dome of the atmosphere booster station, its roaring
atomic motors sending a steady purring sound out
across the desert.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"We made it," said Tom, choking back the tears. "We
made it!"</p>

<p>"Well, blast my jets," said Astro. "We sure did!"</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"And you mean to tell me, you <i>walked</i> across that
desert?" asked Captain Strong.</p>

<p>Tom glanced over at Astro and Roger. "We sure did,
sir."</p>

<p>"With Astro doing the last stretch to the canal carrying
me and dragging Tom," said Roger as he sipped his
hot broth.</p>

<p>The room in the chief engineer's quarters at the atmosphere
station was crowded with workers, enlisted
Solar Guardsmen and officers of the Solar Guard. They
stood around staring in disbelief at the three disheveled
cadets.</p>

<p>"But how did you ever survive?" asked Strong. "By
the craters of Luna, that blasted desert was hotter this
past month than it has ever been since Mars was first
colonized by Earthmen. Why&mdash;why&mdash;you were walking
through temperatures that reached a hundred and
fifty degrees!"</p>

<p>"You don't have to convince us, sir," said Roger with
a smile. "We'll never forget it as long as we live."</p>

<p>Later, when Tom, Roger and Astro had taken a
shower and dressed in fresh uniforms, Strong came in
with an audioscriber and the three cadets gave the full
version of their adventure for the official report back to
the Academy. When they had finished, Strong told
them of his efforts to find them.</p>

<p>"We knew you were in trouble right away," said
Strong, "and we tracked you on radar. But that blasted
storm fouled us all up. We figured that the sand would
have covered up the ship, and that the chances of finding
you in a scout were very small, so I got permission
from Commander Walters to organize this ground
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>search for you." He paused. "Frankly we had just about
given up hope. Took us three weeks finally to locate the
section of desert you landed in."</p>

<p>"We knew you would come, sir," said Tom, "but we
didn't have enough water to wait for you&mdash;and we had
to leave."</p>

<p>"Boys," said Strong slowly, "I've had a lot of wonderful
things happen to me in the Solar Guard. But I have
to confess that seeing you three space-brained idiots
clinging to that raft, ready to eat a raw fish&mdash;well, that
was just about the happiest moment of my life."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Roger, "and I think I can speak
for Tom and Astro when I say that seeing you here
with over a hundred men, and all this equipment,
ready to start searching for us in that desert&mdash;well, it
makes us feel pretty proud to be members of an outfit
where the skipper feels that way about his crew!"</p>

<p>"What happens now, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Aside from getting a well-deserved liberty, it's back
to the old grind at the Academy. The <i>Polaris</i> is at the
spaceport at Marsopolis, waiting for us." He paused
and eyed the three cadets with a smile. "I guess the
routine at Space Academy will seem a little dull now,
after what you've been through."</p>

<p>"Captain Strong," said Astro formally, "I <i>know</i> I
speak for Tom and Roger when I say that <i>routine</i>
is all we want for a long time to come!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" added Tom and Roger in unison.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Strong. "<i>Polaris</i> unit&mdash;Staaaaand
<i>TO</i>!"</p>

<p>The three boys snapped to attention.</p>

<p>"You are hereby ordered to report aboard the <i>Polaris</i>
at fifteen hundred hours and stand by to raise ship!"</p>

<p>He returned their salutes, turned sharply and walked
from the room.</p>

<p>Outside, Steve Strong leaned against the wall and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>stared through the crystal shell of the atmosphere station
into the endless desert.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mars," he said softly, "for making spacemen
out of the <i>Polaris</i> crew!" He saluted sharply and
walked away.</p>

<p>Tom suddenly burst from the room with Roger and
Astro yelling after him.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom, where you going?" yelled Roger.</p>

<p>"I've got to get a bottle of that water out of the canal
for my kid brother Billy!" shouted Tom and disappeared
down a slidestairs.</p>

<p>Roger turned to Astro and said, "That's what I call a
real spaceman."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"After what we've been through, he still remembers
that his kid brother wants a bottle of water from a canal
as a souvenir!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," breathed Astro, "Tom Corbett is&mdash;is&mdash;a real
spaceman!"</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
