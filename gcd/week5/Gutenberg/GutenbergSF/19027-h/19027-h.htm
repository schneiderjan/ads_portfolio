<p>"Emergency air lock open!"</p>

<p>The tall, broad-shouldered officer, wearing the magnificent
black-and-gold uniform of the Solar Guard,
spoke into a small microphone and waited for an acknowledgment.
It came almost immediately.</p>

<p>"Cadet Corbett ready for testing," a voice crackled
thinly over the loud-speaker.</p>

<p>"Very well. Proceed."</p>

<p>Seated in front of the scanner screen on the control
deck of the rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>, Captain Steve Strong
replaced the microphone in its slot and watched a bulky
figure in a space suit step out of the air lock and drift
away from the side of the ship. Behind him, five boys,
all dressed in the vivid blue uniforms of the Space Cadet
Corps, strained forward to watch the lone figure
adjust the nozzles of the jet unit on the back of his
space suit.</p>

<p>"Come on, Tom!" said the biggest of the five boys, his
voice a low, powerful rumble as he rooted for his unit
mate.</p>

<p>"If Tom makes this one," crowed the cadet next to
him, a slender boy with a thick shock of close-cropped
blond hair, "the <i>Polaris</i> unit is home free!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<p>"This is the last test, Manning," replied one of the remaining
three cadets, the insigne of the <i>Arcturus</i> unit
on the sleeve of his uniform. "<i>If</i> Corbett makes this one,
you fellows deserve to win."</p>

<p>Aboard the rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>, blasting through
the black void of space two hundred miles above Earth,
six Space Cadets and a Solar Guard officer were conducting
the final test for unit honors for the term. All
other Academy units had been eliminated in open competition.
Now, the results of the individual space orientation
test would decide whether the three cadets of the
<i>Arcturus</i> unit or the three cadets of the <i>Polaris</i> unit
would win final top unit honors.</p>

<p>Roger Manning and Astro kept their eyes glued to
the telescanner screen, watching their unit mate, Tom
Corbett, drift slowly through space toward his starting
position. The young cadet's task was basically simple;
with his space helmet blacked out so that he could not
see in any direction, he was to make his way back to the
ship from a point a mile away, guided only by the audio
orders from the examining officer aboard the ship. His
score was measured by the time elapsed, and the
amount of corrections and orders given by the examining officer.
It was an exercise designed to test a cadet's
steadiness under emergency conditions of space.</p>

<p>The three members of the <i>Arcturus</i> unit had completed
their runs and had returned to the ship in excellent
time. Roger and Astro had also taken their tests
and now it depended on Tom. If he could return to the
<i>Polaris</i> in less than ten minutes, with no more than three
corrections, the <i>Polaris</i> unit would be victorious.</p>

<p>Seated directly in front of the scanner, Captain Steve
Strong, the examining officer, watched the space-suited
figure dwindle to a mere speck on the screen. As the
regular skipper of the <i>Polaris</i> crew, he could not help
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>secretly rooting for Tom, but he was determined to be
fair, even to the extent of declaring the <i>Arcturus</i> unit
the winner, should the decision be very close. He leaned
forward to adjust the focus on the scanner, bringing the
drifting figure into a close-up view, and then lifted the
microphone to his lips.</p>

<p>"Stand by, Corbett!" he called. "You're getting close
to range."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," replied Tom. "Standing by."</p>

<p>Behind Strong, Roger and Astro looked at each other
and turned back to the screen. As one, they crossed the
fingers of both hands.</p>

<p>"Ready, Corbett!" called Strong. "You'll be clocked
from the second you're on range. One hundred feet&mdash;seventy-five&mdash;fifty&mdash;twenty-five&mdash;ten&mdash;<i>time</i>!"</p>

<p>As the signal echoed in his blacked-out space helmet,
Tom jerked his body around in a sudden violent move,
and grasping the valve of the jet unit on his back, he
opened it halfway. He waited, holding his breath, expecting
to hear Captain Strong correct his course. He
counted to ten slowly, and when no correction came
over the headphones, he opened the valve wide and
blindly shot through space.</p>

<p>Aboard the Polaris, Astro and Roger shouted with joy
and Strong could not repress a grin. The tiny figure on
the scanner was hurtling straight for the side of the
<i>Polaris</i>!</p>

<p>As the image grew larger and larger, anxious eyes
swiveled back and forth from the scanner screen to the
steady sweeping hand of the chronometer. Roger bit his
lip nervously, and Astro's hands trembled.</p>

<p>When Tom reached a point five hundred feet away
from the ship, Strong flipped open the audio circuit and
issued his first order.</p>

<p>"Range five hundred feet," he called. "Cut jets!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>"You're already here, spaceboy!" yelled Roger into
the mike, leaning over Strong's shoulder. The captain
silenced him with a glare. No one could speak to the
examinee but the testing officer.</p>

<p>Tom closed the valve of his jet unit and blindly jerked
himself around again to drift feet first toward the ship.
Strong watched this approach closely, silently admiring
the effortless way the cadet handled himself in weightless
space. When Tom was fifty feet away from the ship,
and still traveling quite fast, Strong gave the second order
to break his speed. Tom opened the valve again and
felt the tug of the jets braking his acceleration. He
drifted slower and slower, and realizing that he was
close to the hull of the ship, he stretched his legs, striving
to make contact. Seconds later he felt a heavy thump
at the soles of his feet, and within the ship there was the
muffled clank of metal boot weights hitting the metal
skin of the hull.</p>

<p>"<i>Time!</i>" roared Strong and glanced at the astral chronometer
over his head. The boys crowded around as the
Solar Guard captain quickly computed Tom's score.
"Nine minutes, fifty-one seconds, and two corrections,"
he announced, unable to keep the pride out of his voice.</p>

<p>"We win! We win!" roared Roger. "Term honors go
to the <i>Polaris</i>!"</p>

<p>Roger turned around and began pounding Astro on
the chest, and the giant Venusian picked him up and
waltzed him around the deck. The three members of
the <i>Arcturus</i> unit waited until the first flush of victory
died away and then crowded around the two boys to
congratulate them.</p>

<p>"Don't forget the cadet who did it," commented
Strong dryly, and the five cadets rushed below to the
jet-boat deck to wait for Tom.</p>

<p>When Tom emerged from the air lock a few moments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>later, Roger and Astro swarmed all over him, and another
wild dance began. Finally, shaking free of his
well-meaning but violent unit mates, he grinned and
gasped, "Well, from that reception, I guess I did it."</p>

<p>"Spaceboy"&mdash;Roger smiled&mdash;"you made the <i>Arcturus</i>
unit look like three old men in a washtub counting
toes!"</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Corbett," said Tony Richards of
the <i>Arcturus</i> crew, offering his hand. "That was really
fast maneuvering out there."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Tony." Tom grinned, running his hand
through his brown curly hair. "But I have to admit I was
a little scared. Wow! What a creepy feeling to know
you're out in space alone and not able to see anything."</p>

<p>Their excitement was interrupted by Strong's voice
over the ship's intercom. "Stand by, all stations!"</p>

<p>"Here we go!" shouted Roger. "Back to the Academy&mdash;and
leave!"</p>

<p>"<i>Yeeeeooooow!</i>" Astro's bull-like roar echoed through
the ship as the cadets hurried to their flight stations.</p>

<p>As command cadet of the <i>Polaris</i>, Tom climbed up to
the control deck, and strapping himself into the command
pilot's seat, prepared to get under way. Astro, the
power-deck cadet who could "take apart a rocket engine
and put it back together again with his thumbs,"
thundered below to the atomic rockets he loved more
than anything else in the universe. Roger Manning, the
third member of the famed <i>Polaris</i> unit, raced up the
narrow ladder leading to the radar bridge to take command
of astrogation and communications.</p>

<p>While Captain Strong and the members of the <i>Arcturus</i>
unit strapped themselves into acceleration cushions,
Tom conducted a routine check of the many gauges on
the great control panel before him. Satisfied, he flipped
open the intercom and called, "All stations, check in!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>"Radar deck, aye!" drawled Roger's lazy voice.</p>

<p>"Power deck, aye!" rumbled Astro.</p>

<p>"Energize the cooling pumps!" ordered Tom.</p>

<p>"Cooling pumps, aye!"</p>

<p>The whine of the mighty pumps was suddenly heard,
moaning eerily throughout the ship.</p>

<p>"Feed reactant!"</p>

<p>The sharp hiss of fuel being forced into the rocket engines
rose above the whine of the pumps, and the ship
trembled.</p>

<p>"Stand by to blast," called Tom. "Standard space
speed!"</p>

<p>Instantly the <i>Polaris</i> shot toward Earth in a long,
curving arc. Moments later, when the huge round ball
of the mother planet loomed large on the scanner
screen, Roger's voice reported over the intercom, "Academy
spaceport control gives us approach orbit 074 for
touchdown on Ramp Twelve, Tom."</p>

<p>"074 Ramp Twelve," repeated Tom. "Got it!"</p>

<p>"Twelve!" roared Astro suddenly over the intercom.
"Couldn't you make it closer to the Academy than that,
Manning? We'll have to walk two miles to the nearest
slidewalk!"</p>

<p>"Too bad, Astro," retorted Roger, "but I guess if I
had to carry around as much useless muscle and bone as
you do, I'd complain too!"</p>

<p>"I'm just not as lucky as you, Manning," snapped Astro
quickly. "I don't have all that space gas to float me
around."</p>

<p>"Knock it off, fellows," interjected Tom firmly. "We're
going into our approach."</p>

<p>Lying on his acceleration cushion, Strong looked over
at Tony Richards of the <i>Arcturus</i> unit and winked.
Richards winked and smiled back. "They never stop,
do they, sir?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>"When they do," replied Strong, "I'll send all three of
them to sick bay for examination."</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand feet to Earth's surface,"
called Tom. "Stand by for landing operations."</p>

<p>As Tom adjusted the many controls on the complicated
operations panel of the ship, Roger and Astro followed
his orders quickly and exactly. "Cut main drive
rockets and give me one-half thrust on forward braking
rockets!" ordered Tom, his eyes glued to the altimeter.</p>

<p>The <i>Polaris</i> shuddered under the sudden reverse in
power, then began an upward curve, nose pointing back
toward space. Tom barked another command. "Braking
rockets full! Stand by main drive rockets!"</p>

<p>The sleek ship began to settle tailfirst toward its destination&mdash;Space
Academy, U.S.A.</p>

<p>In the heart of a great expanse of cleared land in the
western part of the North American continent, the cluster
of buildings that marked Space Academy gleamed
brightly in the noon sun. Towering over the green
grassy quadrangle of the Academy was the magnificent
Tower of Galileo, built of pure Titan crystal which
gleamed like a gigantic diamond. With smaller buildings,
including the study halls, the nucleonics laboratory,
the cadet dormitories, mess halls, recreation halls,
all connected by rolling slidewalks&mdash;and to the north,
the vast area of the spaceport with its blast-pitted ramps&mdash;the
Academy was the goal of every boy in the year
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 2353, the age of the conquest of space.</p>

<p>Founded over a hundred years before, Space Academy
trained the youth of the Solar Alliance for service
in the Solar Guard, the powerful force created to protect
the liberties of the planets. But from the beginning,
Academy standards were so high, requirements so
strict, that not many made it. Of the one thousand boys
enrolled every year, it was expected that only twenty-one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>of them would become officers, and of this group,
only seven would be command pilots. The great Solar
Guard fleet that patrolled the space lanes across the
millions of miles between the satellites and planets possessed
the finest, yet most complicated, equipment in
the Alliance. To be an officer in the fleet required a
combination of skills and technical knowledge so demanding
that eighty per cent of the Solar Guard officers
retired at the age of forty.</p>

<p>High over the spaceport, the three cadets of the <i>Polaris</i>
unit, happy over the prospect of a full month of
freedom, concentrated on the task of landing the great
ship on the Academy spaceport. Watching the teleceiver
screen that gave him a view of the spaceport
astern of the ship, Tom called into the intercom, "One
thousand feet to touchdown. Cut braking rockets. Main
drive full!"</p>

<p>The thunderous blast of the rockets was his answer,
building up into roaring violence. Shuddering, the great
cruiser eased to the ground foot by foot, perfectly balanced
on the fiery exhaust from her main tubes.</p>

<p>Seconds later the giant shock absorbers crunched on
the ramp and Tom closed the master switch cutting all
power. He glanced at the astral chronometer over his
head and then turned to speak into the audio log recorder.
"Rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i> completed space flight
one-seven-six at 1301."</p>

<p>Captain Strong stepped up to Tom and clapped him
on the shoulder. "Secure the <i>Polaris</i>, Tom, and tell Astro
to get the reactant pile from the firing chamber
ready for dumping when the hot-soup wagon gets
here." The Solar Guard officer referred to the lead-lined
jet sled that removed the reactant piles from all ships
that were to be laid up for longer than three days. "And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>you'd better get over to your dorm right away," Strong
continued. "You have to get ready for parade and full
Corps dismissal."</p>

<p>Tom grinned. "Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"We're blasting off, sir," said Tony Richards, stepping
forward with his unit mates. "Congratulations again,
Corbett. I still can't figure out how you did it so
quickly!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Tony," replied Tom graciously. "It was luck
and the pressure of good competition."</p>

<p>Richards shook hands and then turned to Strong. "Do
I have your permission to leave the ship, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Permission granted," replied Strong. "And have a
good leave."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>The three <i>Arcturus</i> cadets saluted and left the ship.
A moment later Roger and Astro joined Strong and Tom
on the control deck.</p>

<p>"Well," said Strong, "what nonsense have you three
planned for your leave? Try and see Liddy Tamal. I
hear she's making a new stereo about the Solar Guard.
You might be hired as technical assistants." He smiled.
The famous actress was a favorite of the cadets. Strong
waited. "Well, is it a secret?"</p>

<p>"It was your idea, Astro," said Roger. "Go ahead."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Tom. "You got us into this."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," mumbled Astro, turning red with embarrassment,
"we're going to Venus."</p>

<p>"What's so unusual about going to Venus?" asked
Strong.</p>

<p>"We're going hunting," replied Astro.</p>

<p>"Hunting?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," gulped the big Venusian. "For tyrannosaurus."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>Strong's jaw dropped and he sat down suddenly on
the nearest acceleration cushion. "I expected something
a little strange from you three whiz kids." He laughed.
"It would be impossible for you to go home and relax
for a month. But this blasts me! Hunting for a tyrannosaurus!
What are you going to do with it after you catch
it?" He paused and then added, "If you do."</p>

<p>"Eat it," said Astro simply. "Tyrannosaurus steak is
delicious!"</p>

<p>Strong doubled with laughter at the seriousness of
Astro's expression. The giant Venusian continued doggedly,
"And besides, there's a bounty on them. A thousand
credits for every tyranno head brought in. They're
dangerous and destroy a lot of crops."</p>

<p>Strong straightened up. "All right, all right! Go ahead!
Have yourselves a good time, but don't take any unnecessary
chances. I like my cadets to have all the arms
and legs and heads they're supposed to have." He
paused and glanced at his watch. "You'd better get hopping.
Astro, did you get the pile ready for the soup
wagon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Very well, Tom, secure the ship." He came to attention.
"Unit, <i>stand&mdash;to</i>!"</p>

<p>The three cadets stiffened and saluted sharply.</p>

<p>"Unit dismissed!"</p>

<p>Captain Strong turned and left the ship.</p>

<p>Hurriedly, Tom, Roger, and Astro checked the great
spaceship and fifteen minutes later were racing out of
the main air lock. Hitching a ride on a jet sled to the
nearest slidewalk, they were soon being whisked along
toward their quarters. Already, cadet units were standing
around in fresh blues waiting for the call for final
dress parade.</p>

<p>At exactly fifteen hundred, the entire Cadet Corps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>stepped off with electronic precision for the final drill of
the term. By threes, each unit marching together, with
the <i>Polaris</i> unit walking behind the standard bearers as
honor unit, they passed the reviewing stand. Senior officers
of the Solar Guard, delegates from the Solar Alliance,
and staff officers of the Academy accepted their
salute. Commander Walters stood stiffly in front of the
stand, his heart filled with pride as he recognized the
honor unit. He had almost washed out the <i>Polaris</i> unit
in the beginning of their Academy training.</p>

<p>Major Lou Connel, Senior Line Officer of the Solar
Guard, stepped forward when the cadets came to a stop
and presented Tom, Roger, and Astro with the emblem
of their achievement, a small gold pin in the shape of a
rocket ship. He, too, had had his difficulties with the
<i>Polaris</i> unit, and while he had never been heard to compliment
anyone on anything, expecting nothing but the
best all the time, he nevertheless congratulated them
heartily as he gave them their hard-won trophy.</p>

<p>After several other awards had been presented, Commander
Walters addressed the Cadet Corps, concluding
with "... each of you has had a tough year. But when
you come back in four weeks, you'll think this past term
has been a picnic. And remember, wherever you go,
whatever you do, you're Space Cadets! Act like one!
But above all, have a good time! Spaceman's luck!"</p>

<p>A cadet stepped forward quickly, turned to face the
line of cadets, and held up his hands. He brought them
down quickly and words of the Academy song thundered
from a thousand voices.</p>

<p>"<i>Dis</i>-missed!" roared Walters. Immediately the precise
lines of cadets turned into a howling mob of eager
boys, everyone seemingly running in a different direction.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Roger. "I've got everything set! Let's
get to the station ahead of the mob."</p>

<p>"But what about our gear?" said Tom. "We've got to
get back to the dorm."</p>

<p>"I had it sent down to the station last night. I got the
monorail tickets to Atom City last week, and reserved
seats on the <i>Venus Lark</i> two weeks ago! Come on!"</p>

<p>"Only Roger could handle it so sweetly," sighed Astro.
"You know, hotshot, sometimes I think you're useful!"</p>

<p>The three cadets turned and raced across the quadrangle
for the nearest slidewalk that would take them to
the Academy monorail station and the beginning of
their adventure in the jungles of Venus.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2" id="CHAPTER_2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>


<p>"The situation may be serious and it may not, but I
don't want to take any chances."</p>

<p>Commander Walters sat in his office, high up in the
Tower of Galileo, with department heads from the
Academy and Solar Guard. Behind him, an entire wall
made of clear crystal offered a breath-taking view of the
Academy grounds. Before him, their faces showing
their concern over a report Walters had just read, Captain
Strong, Major Connel, Dr. Joan Dale, and Professor
Sykes waited for the commanding officer of the Academy
to continue.</p>

<p>"As you know," said Walters, "the resolution passed
by the Council in establishing the Solar Guard specifically
states that it shall be the duty of the Solar Guard
to investigate and secure evidence for the Solar Alliance
Council of any acts by any person, or group of persons,
suspected of overt action against the Solar Constitution
or the Universal Bill of Rights. Now, based on
the report I've just read to you, I would like an opinion
from each of you."</p>

<p>"For what purpose, Commander?" asked Joan Dale,
the young and pretty astrophysicist.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>"To decide whether it would be advisable to have a
full and open investigation of this information from the
Solar Guard attach&eacute; on Venus."</p>

<p>"Why waste time talking?" snapped Professor Sykes,
the chief of the nucleonics laboratory. "Let's investigate.
That report sounds serious."</p>

<p>Major Connel leveled a beady eye on the little gray-haired
man.</p>

<p>"Professor Sykes, an investigation is serious. When it
is based on a report like this one, it is doubly serious,
and needs straight and careful thinking. We don't want
to hurt innocent people."</p>

<p>Sykes shifted around in his chair and glared at the
burly Solar Guard officer. "Don't try to tell me anything
about straight thinking, Connel. I know more about the
Solar Constitution and the rights of our citizens than
you'll know in ten thousand light years!"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" roared Connel. "And with all your brains
you'd probably find out these people are nothing more
than a harmless bunch of colonists out on a picnic!"</p>

<p>The professor shot out of his chair and waved an angry
finger under Connel's nose. "And that would be a
lot more than I'm finding out right now with that contraption
of yours!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Connel's face turned red. "So that's how you feel
about my invention!" he snapped.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the way I feel about your invention!" replied
Sykes hotly. "I know three cadets that could build
that gadget in half the time it's taken you just to figure
out the theory!"</p>

<p>Commander Walters, Captain Strong, and Joan Dale
were fighting to keep from laughing at the hot exchange
between the two veteran spacemen.</p>

<p>"They sound like the <i>Polaris</i> unit," Joan whispered to
Strong.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>Walters stood up. "Gentlemen! Please! We're here to
discuss a report on the activities of a secret organization
on Venus. I will have to ask you to keep to the subject
at hand. Dr. Dale, do you have any comments on the
report?" He turned to the young physicist who was
choking off a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, Commander," she began, still smiling, "the report
is rather sketchy. I would like to see more information
before any real decision is made."</p>

<p>Walters turned to Strong. "Steve?"</p>

<p>"I think Joan has the right idea, sir," he replied.
"While the report indicates that a group of people on
Venus are meeting regularly and secretly, and wearing
some silly uniform, I think we need more information
before ordering a full-scale investigation."</p>

<p>"He's right, Commander," Connel broke in. "You just
can't walk into an outfit and demand a look at their records,
books, and membership index, unless you're pretty
sure you'll find something."</p>

<p>"Send a man from here," Strong suggested. "If you
use anyone out of the Venus office, he might be recognized."</p>

<p>"Good idea," commented Sykes.</p>

<p>Joan nodded. "Sounds reasonable."</p>

<p>"How do you feel about it, Connel?" asked Walters.</p>

<p>Connel, still furious over Sykes's comment on his
spectrum recorder, shot an angry glance at the professor.
"I think it's fine," he said bluntly. "Who're you going
to send?"</p>

<p>Walters paused before answering. He glanced at
Strong and then back at Connel. "What about yourself?"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" continued Walters. "You know as much
about Venus as anyone, and you have a lot of friends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>there you can trust. Nose around a while, see what you
can learn, unofficially."</p>

<p>"But what about my work on the spectrum recorder?"
asked Connel.</p>

<p>"That!" snorted Sykes derisively. "Huh, that can be
completed any time you want to listen to some plain
facts about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll never listen to anything you have to say, you
dried-up old neutron chaser!" blasted Connel.</p>

<p>"Of course not," cackled Sykes. "And it's the same
bullheaded stubbornness that'll keep you from finishing
that recorder."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, gentlemen," said Walters firmly. "I cannot
allow personal discussions to interfere with the problem
at hand. How about it, Connel? Will you go to Venus?"</p>

<p>Lou Connel was the oldest line officer in the Solar
Guard, having recommended the slightly younger Walters
for the post of commandant of Space Academy and
the Solar Guard so that he himself could escape a desk
job and continue blasting through space where he had
devoted his entire life. While Walters had the authority
to order him to accept the assignment, Connel knew
that if he begged off because of his work on the recorder,
Walters would understand and offer the assignment
to Strong. He paused and then growled, "When
do I blast off?"</p>

<p>Walters smiled and answered, "As soon as we contact
Venus headquarters and tell them to expect you."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better to let me go without any fanfare?"
mused the burly spaceman. "I could just take a
ship and act as though I'm on some kind of special detail.
As a matter of fact, Higgleston at the Venusport
lab has some information I could use."</p>

<p>"Anything Higgleston could tell you," interjected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Sykes, "I can tell you! You're just too stubborn to listen
to me."</p>

<p>Connel opened his mouth to blast the professor in return,
but he caught a sharp look from Walters and he
clamped his lips together tightly.</p>

<p>"I guess that's it, then," said Walters. "Anyone have
any other ideas?" He glanced around the room. "Joan?
Steve?"</p>

<p>Dr. Dale and Captain Strong shook their heads silently.
Strong was disappointed that he had not been
given the assignment on Venus. Four weeks at the deserted
Academy would seem like living in a graveyard.
Walters sensed his feelings, and smiling, he said, "You've
been going like a hot rocket this past year, Steve. I have
a specific assignment for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" Strong looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>"I want you to go to the Sweet Water Lakes around
New Chicago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;go to my cabin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;<i>and go fishing</i>!"</p>

<p>Strong grinned. "Thanks, skipper," he said quietly. "I
guess I could use a little relaxation. I was almost
tempted to join Corbett, Manning, and Astro. They're
going hunting in the jungle belt of Venus for a tyrannosaurus!"</p>

<p>"Blast my jets!" roared Connel. "Those boys haven't
killed themselves in line of duty, so they go out and tangle
with the biggest and most dangerous monster in the
entire solar system!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Joan with a smile, "I'll put my money on
Astro against a tyranno any time, pound for pound!"</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" chimed in Sykes, and forgetting his argument
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>with Connel, he turned to the spaceman. "Say,
Lou," he said, "when you get to Venus tell Higgy I said
to show you that magnetic ionoscope he's rigging up. It
might give you some ideas."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied Connel, also forgetting the hot exchange
of a few minutes before. He stood up. "I'll take
the <i>Polaris</i>, Commander. She's the fastest ship available
with automatic controls for a solo hop."</p>

<p>"She's been stripped of her reactant pile, Major," said
Strong. "It'll take a good eighteen hours to soup her up
again."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of it," said Connel. "Are there any specific
orders, Commander?"</p>

<p>"Use your own judgment, Lou," said Walters. "You
know what we want and how far to go to get it. If you
learn anything, we'll start a full-scale investigation. If
not, we'll forget the whole matter and no one will get
hurt."</p>

<p>"And the Solar Guard won't get a reputation of being
nosy," added Strong.</p>

<p>Connel nodded. "I'll take care of it." He shook hands
all around, coming to Sykes last. "Sorry I lost my temper,
Professor," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"Forget it, Major." Sykes smiled. He really admired
the gruff spaceman.</p>

<p>The thick-set senior officer came to smart attention,
saluted crisply, turned, and left the office. For the time
being, the mysterious trouble on Venus was his responsibility.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Atom City express leaving on Track Four!"</p>

<p>A metallic voice boomed over the station loud-speaker,
as last-minute passengers boarded the long
line of gleaming white monorail cars, hanging from a
single overhead steel rail. In the open doorway of one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>of the end cars, a conductor lifted his arm, then paused
and waited patiently as three Space Cadets raced down
the stairs and along the platform in a headlong dash for
the train. They piled inside, almost one on top of the
other.</p>

<p>"Thanks for waiting, sir," gasped Tom Corbett.</p>

<p>"Not at all, Cadet," said the conductor. "I couldn't let
you waste your leave waiting for another train."</p>

<p>The elderly man flipped a switch in the narrow vestibule
and the door closed with a soft hiss of air. He inserted
a light key into a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's note: 'nearby' hyphenated to conform with majority practice in text.">near-by</ins> socket and twisted it
gently, completing a circuit that flashed the "go" light
in the engineer's cab. Almost immediately, the monorail
train eased forward, suspended on the overhead rail. By
the time the last building of Space Academy flashed
past, the train was rolling along at full speed on its dash
across the plains to Atom City.</p>

<p>The ride to the great metropolis of the North American
continent was filled with excitement and anticipation
for the three members of the <i>Polaris</i> crew. The cars
were crowded with cadets on leave, and while there
was a lot of joking and horseplay, the few civilian passengers
were impressed with the gentlemanly bearing
of the young spacemen. Tom and Roger finally settled
down to read the latest magazines supplied by the
monorail company. But Astro headed for the dining car
where he attracted a great deal of attention by his order
of a dozen eggs, followed by two orders of waffles and a
full quart of milk. Finally, when the dining-car steward
called a halt, because it was closing time, Astro made
his way back to Tom and Roger with a plastic bag of
French fried potatoes, and the three boys sat, munching
them happily. The countryside flashed by in a blur of
summer color as the train roared on at a speed of two
hundred miles an hour.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>A few hours and four bags of potatoes later, Astro
yawned and stretched his enormous arms, nearly poking
Roger in the eye.</p>

<p>"Hey, ya big ape!" growled Roger. "Watch the eye!"</p>

<p>"You'd never miss it, Manning," said Astro. "Just use
your radar."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I like this eye just the way it is."</p>

<p>"We're almost there," called Tom. He pointed out the
crystal window and they could see the high peaks of the
Rocky Mountain range looming ahead. "We cut through
the new tunnel in those mountains and we'll be in Atom
City in ten minutes!"</p>

<p>There was a bustle of activity around them as other
cadets roused themselves and collected their gear. Once
again conversation became animated and excited as the
train neared its destination. Flashing into the tunnel,
the line of cars began to slow down, rocking gently.</p>

<p>"We'd better go right out to the spaceport," said
Tom, pulling his gear out of the recessed rack under his
seat. "Our ship blasts off for Venus in less than a half-hour."</p>

<p>"Boy, it'll be a pleasure to ride a spaceship without
having to astrogate," said Roger. "I'll just sit back and
take it easy. Hope there are some good-looking space
dolls aboard."</p>

<p>Tom turned to Astro. "You know, Astro," he said seriously,
"it's a good thing we're along to take care of this
Romeo. If he were alone, he'd wind up in another kind
of hunt."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see how Manning's tactics work on a female
dasypus novemcinctur maximus," said Astro with
a sly grin.</p>

<p>"A female what?" yelled Roger.</p>

<p>"A giant armadillo, Roger," Tom explained, laughing.
"Very big and very mean when they don't like you.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Don't forget, everything on Venus grows big because of
the lighter gravity."</p>

<p>"Yeah," drawled Roger, looking at Astro. "Big and
dumb!"</p>

<p>"What was that again?" bellowed the giant Venusian,
reaching for the flip cadet. The next moment, Roger
was struggling futilely, feet kicking wildly as Astro held
him at arm's length six inches off the floor. The cadets
in the car roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"Atom City!" a voice over the intercar communicator
boomed and the boys looked out the window to see the
towering buildings of Atom City slowly slide by. The
train had scarcely reached a full stop when the three
cadets piled out of the door, raced up the slidestairs,
and jumped into a jet cab. Fifteen minutes later they
marched up to one of the many ticket counters of the
Atom City Interplanetary Spaceport.</p>

<p>"Reservations for Cadets Corbett, Manning, and Astro
on the <i>Venus Lark</i>, please," announced Tom.</p>

<p>The girl behind the counter ran her finger down a
passenger manifest, nodded, and then suddenly
frowned. She turned back to Tom and said, "I'm sorry,
Cadet, but your reservations have been pre-empted by
a priority listing."</p>

<p>"Priority!" roared Roger. "But I made those reservations
two weeks ago. If there was a change, why didn't
you tell us before?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," said the girl patiently, "but according
to the manifest, the priority call just came in a few
hours ago. Someone contacted Space Academy, but you
had already left."</p>

<p>"Well, is there another ship for Venusport today?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied and picked up another manifest.
Glancing at it quickly, she shook her head. "There are
no open reservations," she said. "I'm afraid the next
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>flight for Venusport with open reservations isn't for four
days."</p>

<p>"Blast my jets!" growled Roger disgustedly. "Four
days!" He sat down on his gear and scowled. Astro
leaned against the desk and stared gloomily at the floor.
At that moment a young man with a thin face and a
strained intense look pushed Tom to one side with a
curt "Excuse me!" and stepped up to the desk.</p>

<p>"You're holding three reservations on the <i>Venus
Lark</i>," he spoke quickly. "Priority number four-seven-six,
S.D."</p>

<p>Tom, Roger, and Astro looked at him closely. They
saw him nervously pay for his tickets and then walk
away quickly without another look at the ticket girl.</p>

<p>"Were those our seats, miss?" asked Tom. The girl
nodded.</p>

<p>The three cadets stared after the young man who had
bumped them off their ship.</p>

<p>"The symbol S.D. on the priority stands for Solar
Delegate," said Roger. "Maybe he's a messenger."</p>

<p>The young man was joined by two other men also
dressed in Venusian clothing, and after a few words,
they all turned and stepped onto the slidewalk rolling
out to the giant passenger ship preparing to blast off.</p>

<p>"This is the most rocket-blasting bit of luck in the
universe!" growled Roger. "Four days!"</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Roger," said Tom. "We can spend the four
days in Atom City. Maybe Liddy Tamal is here. We
can follow Captain Strong's suggestion."</p>

<p>"Even she doesn't make four days delay sound exciting,"
interrupted Roger. "Come on. We might as well
go back to town or we won't even get a room."</p>

<p>He picked up his gear and walked back to the jet cab-stand.
Astro and Tom followed the blond-haired cadet
glumly.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>The stand was empty, but a jet cab was just pulling
up to the platform with a passenger. As the boys walked
over to wait at the door, it opened and a familiar figure
in a black-and-gold uniform stepped out.</p>

<p>"Captain Strong!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-033.png" width="500" height="423" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Corbett!" exclaimed Strong. "What are you doing
here? I thought you were aboard the <i>Venus Lark</i>."</p>

<p>"We were bumped out of our reservation by an S.D.
priority," said Astro.</p>

<p>"And we can't get out of here for another four days,"
added Roger glumly.</p>

<p>Strong sympathized. "That's rough, Astro." He looked
at the three dour faces and then said, "Would you consider
getting a free ride to Venus?"</p>

<p>The three cadets looked up hopefully.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>"Major Connel's taking the <i>Polaris</i> to Venus to complete
some work with Professor Higgleston in the Venus
lab," explained Strong. "If you can get back to the
Academy before he blasts off, he might give you a ride."</p>

<p>"No, thanks!" said Roger. "I'd rather sit here."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Roger," said Tom. "We're on leave,
remember? And it's only a short hop to Venus."</p>

<p>"Yeah, hotshot," added Astro. "We'll get to Venus
faster than the <i>Venus Lark</i>, and save money besides."</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Roger. "I guess I can take him for a little
while."</p>

<p>Strong suppressed a smile. Roger's reluctance to go
with Connel was well founded. Any cadet within hailing
distance of the hard-bitten spaceman was likely to
wind up with a bookful of demerits.</p>

<p>"Are you on an assignment, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Vacation," said Strong. "Four weeks of fishing at
Commander Walters' cabin at Sweet Water Lakes."</p>

<p>"If you pass through New Chicago," said Tom, "you
would be welcome to stop in at my house. Mom and
Dad would be mighty happy to meet you. And I think
Billy, my kid brother, would flip a rocket."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Tom. I might do that if I have time." He
looked at his watch. "You three had better hurry. I'd
advise taking a jetcopter back to the Academy. You
might not make it if you wait for a monorail."</p>

<p>"We'll do that, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>The three boys threw their gear into the waiting cab
and piled in. Strong watched them roar away, frowning
in thought. An S.D. priority, the highest priority in
space, was used only by special couriers on important
missions for one of the delegates. He shrugged it off.
"Getting to be as suspicious as an old space hen," he
said to himself. "Fishing is what I need. A good fight
with a trout instead of a space conspiracy!"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3" id="CHAPTER_3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>


<p>"Blast off&mdash;minus&mdash;five&mdash;four&mdash;three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;<i>zero</i>!"</p>

<p>As the main drive rockets blasted into life, Tom fell
back in his seat before the control panel of the <i>Polaris</i>
and felt the growing thrust as the giant ship lifted off
the ground, accelerating rapidly. He kept his eyes on
the teleceiver screen and saw Space Academy fall away
behind them. On the power deck Astro lay strapped in
his acceleration cushion, his outstretched hand on the
emergency booster rocket switch should the main rockets
fail before the ship could reach the free fall of space.
On the radar bridge Roger watched the far-flung stars
become brighter as the rocket ship hurtled through the
dulling layers of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship reached weightless space, Tom
flipped on the gravity generators and put the <i>Polaris</i> on
her course to Venus. Almost immediately the intercom
began to blast.</p>

<p>"Now hear this!" Major Connel's voice roared. "Corbett,
Manning, and Astro! I don't want any of your
space-blasted nonsense on this trip! Get this ship to Venusport
in the shortest possible time without burning
out the pump bearings. And, Manning&mdash;!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, sir," replied the blond-haired cadet.</p>

<p>"If I so much as hear one wisecrack between you and
that overgrown rocket jockey, Astro, I'll log both of you
twenty-five demerits!"</p>

<p>"I understand, sir," acknowledged Roger lazily. "I
rather appreciate your relieving me of the necessity of
speaking to that space ape!"</p>

<p>Listening to their voices on the control deck, Tom
grinned and waited expectantly. He wasn't disappointed.</p>

<p>"Ape!" came a bull-like roar from the power deck.
"Why, you skinny moth-eaten piece of space junk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cadet Astro!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" Astro was suddenly meek.</p>

<p>"If you say one more word, I'll bury you in demerits!"</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No <i>buts</i>!" roared Connel. "And you, Manning&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" chimed in Roger innocently.</p>

<p>"Keep your mouth shut!"</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said Roger.</p>

<p>"Corbett?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"I'm putting you in charge of monitoring the intercom.
If those two space idiots start jabbering again, call
me. That's an order! I'll be in my quarters working."
Connel switched off abruptly.</p>

<p>"You hear that, fellows?" said Tom. "Knock it off."</p>

<p>"O.K., Tom," replied Roger, "just keep him out of my
sight."</p>

<p>"That goes for me, too," added Astro. "Ape! Just wait
till I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Astro!" Tom interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>"O.K., O.K.," groaned the big cadet.</p>

<p>Glancing over the panel once more and satisfying
himself that the ship was functioning smoothly, Tom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>sighed and settled back in his seat, enjoying the temporary
peace and solitude. It had been a tough year, filled
with intensive study in the quest for an officer's commission
in the Solar Guard. Space Academy was the finest
school in the world, but it was also the toughest. The
young cadet shook his head, remembering a six-weeks'
grind he, Roger, and Astro had gone through on a nuclear
project. Knowing how to operate an atomic rocket
motor was one thing, but understanding what went on
inside the reactant pile was something else entirely.
Never had the three cadets worked harder, or more
closely together. But Astro's thorough, practical knowledge
of basic nucleonics, combined with Roger's native
wizardry at higher mathematics, and his own understanding
of the theory, had enabled them to pull
through with a grade of seventy-two, the highest average
ever made by a cadet unit not specializing in physics.</p>

<p>As the ship rocketed smoothly through the airless void
of space toward the misty planet of Venus, Tom made
another quick but thorough check of the panel, and
then returned to his reflections on the past term. It had
been particularly difficult since they had missed many
valuable hours of classroom work and study because of
their adventure on the new colony of Roald (as described
in <i>The Space Pioneers</i>), but they had come
through somehow. He shook his head wondering how
they had made it. Forty-two units had washed out during
the term. Instead of getting easier, the courses of
study were getting more difficult all the time, and in his
speech on the parade grounds, Commander Walters
had promised&mdash;</p>

<p>"Emergency!"</p>

<p>Roger's voice over the intercom brought Tom out of
his reverie sharply.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>"All hands," continued the cadet on the radar bridge
hurriedly, "secure your stations and get to the jet-boat
deck on the double! Emergency!"</p>

<p>As the sharp clang of the emergency alarm rang out,
Tom did not stop to question Roger's sudden order.
Neutralizing all controls, he leaped for the hatch leading
below. Taking the ladder four steps at a time, Tom
saw Major Connel tear out of his quarters. The elder
spaceman dived for the ladder himself, not stopping to
ask questions. He was automatic in his reliance on the
judgment of others. The few seconds spent in talk could
mean the difference between life and death in space
where you seldom got a second chance.</p>

<p>Tom and Connel arrived on the jet-boat deck to find
Astro already preparing the small space craft for launching.
As they struggled into space suits, Roger appeared.
In answer to their questioning looks, he explained laconically,
"Unidentifiable object attached to ship on
fin parallel to steering vanes. Thought we'd better go
outside first and examine later."</p>

<p>Connel nodded his mute agreement, and thirty seconds
later the tiny jet boat was blasting out of the escape
lock into space.</p>

<p>Circling around the ship to the stern, the jet boat,
under Major Connel's sure touch, stopped fifty feet
from the still glowing, exhaust tubes. He and the three
cadets stared out at a small metallic boxlike object attached
to the underside of the stabilizer fin.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose it is?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Roger, "but it sure doesn't belong
there. That's why I rang the emergency on you."</p>

<p>"You were absolutely right, Manning," asserted Connel.
"If it's harmless, we can always get back aboard
and nothing's been lost except a little time." He rose
from the pilot's seat and stepped toward the hatch.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
"Come with me, Corbett. We'll have a look. And bring
the radiation counter along."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>Tom reached into a near-by locker, and pulling out a
small, rectangular box with a round hornlike grid in its
face, plunged out of the hatch with Major Connel and
blasted across the fifty-foot gap to the stabilizer fin of
the <i>Polaris</i>.</p>

<p>Connel gestured toward the object on the fin. "See if
she's hot, Corbett."</p>

<p>The young cadet pressed a small button on the
counter and turned the horn toward the mysterious box.
Immediately the needle on the dial above the horn
jumped from white to pink and finally red, quivering
against the stop pin.</p>

<p>"Hot!" exclaimed Tom. "She almost kicked the pin
off!"</p>

<p>"Get off the ship!" roared Connel. "It's a fission bomb
with a time fuse!"</p>

<p>Tom dove at the box and tried to pull it off the stabilizer,
but Major Connel grabbed him by the arm and
wrenched him out into space.</p>

<p>"You space-blasted idiot!" Connel growled. "That
thing's liable to go off any second! Get away from here!"</p>

<p>With a mighty shove, the spaceman sent Tom flying
out toward the jet boat and then jumped to safety himself.
Within seconds he and the young cadet were
aboard the jet boat again and, not stopping to answer
Astro's or Roger's questions, he jammed his foot down
hard on the acceleration lever, sending the tiny ship
blasting away from the <i>Polaris</i>.</p>

<p>Not until they were two miles away from the stricken
rocket ship did Connel bring the craft to a stop. He
turned and gazed helplessly at the gleaming hull of the
<i>Polaris</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<p>"So they know," he said bitterly. "They're trying to
stop me from even reaching Venus."</p>

<p>The three cadets looked at each other and then at the
burly spaceman, bewilderment in their eyes.</p>

<p>"What's this all about, sir?" Roger finally asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not at liberty to tell you, Manning," replied
Connel. "Though I want to thank you for your quick
thinking. How did you happen to discover the bomb?"</p>

<p>"I was sighting on Regulus for a position check and
Regulus was dead astern, so when I swung the periscope
scanner around, I spotted that thing stuck to the
fin. I didn't bother to think about it, I just yelled."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-040.png" width="500" height="438" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Glad you did," nodded Connel and turned to stare
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>at the <i>Polaris</i> again. "Now I'm afraid we'll just have to
wait until that bomb goes off."</p>

<p>"Isn't there anything we can do?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Not a blasted thing," replied Connel grimly. "Thank
the universe we shut off all power. If that baby had
blown while the reactant was feeding into the firing
chambers, we'd have wound up a big splash of nothing."</p>

<p>"This way," commented Astro sourly, "it'll just blast a
hole in the side of the ship."</p>

<p>"We might be able to repair that," said Tom hopefully.</p>

<p>"There she goes!" shouted Roger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-041.png" width="500" height="431" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Staring out the windshield, they saw a sudden blinding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>flash of light appear over the stern section of the
<i>Polaris</i>, a white-hot blaze of incandescence that made
them flinch and crouch back.</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" exclaimed Connel.</p>

<p>Before their eyes they saw the stabilizer fin melt and
curl under the intense heat of the bomb. There was no
sound or shock wave in the vacuum of space, but they
all shuddered as though an overwhelming force had
swept over them. Within seconds the flash was gone
and the <i>Polaris</i> was drifting in the cold blackness
of space! The only outward damage visible was the
twisted stabilizer, but the boys realized that she must
be a shambles within.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll have to wait a while before we go back
aboard. There might be radioactivity around the hull,"
Roger remarked.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Tom. "The <i>Polaris</i> was still
coasting when we left her. We cut out the drive rockets,
but we didn't brake her. She's probably drifted away
from the radioactivity already."</p>

<p>"Corbett's right," said Connel. "A hot cloud would be
a hundred miles away by now." He pressed down on
the acceleration lever and the jet boat eased toward
the ship. Edging cautiously toward the stern of the
spaceship, they saw the blasted section of the fin already
cooling in the intense cold of outer space.</p>

<p>"Think I'd better call a Solar Guard patrol ship, sir?"
asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Let's wait until we check the damage, Manning,"
replied Connel.</p>

<p>"Yeah," chimed in Astro grimly, "if I can help it, I'm
going to bring the <i>Polaris</i> in." He paused and then
added, "If I have to carry her on my back."</p>

<p>As soon as a quick check with the radiation counter
showed them that the hull was free of radioactivity,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Major Connel and the three cadets re-entered the ship.</p>

<p>While the lack of atmosphere outside had dissipated
the full force of the blast, the effect on the inside of the
ship, where Earth's air pressure was maintained, was
devastating. Whole banks of delicate machinery were
torn from the walls and scattered over the decks. The
precision instruments of the inner hull showed no signs
of leakage, and the oxygen-circulating machinery could
still function on an auxiliary power hookup.</p>

<p>Completing the quick survey of the ship, Major Connel
realized that they would never be able to continue
their flight to Venus and instructed Roger to contact
the nearest Solar Guard patrol ship to pick them up.</p>

<p>"The <i>Polaris</i> will have to be left in space," continued
Connel, "and a maintenance crew will be sent out to see
if she can be repaired. If they decide it isn't worth the
labor, they'll junk her here in space."</p>

<p>The faces of the three cadets fell.</p>

<p>"But there's no real damage on her power deck, sir,"
said Astro. "And the hull is in good shape, except for the
stabilizer fin and some of the stern plates. Why, sometimes
a green Earthworm unit will crack a fin on their
first touchdown."</p>

<p>"And the radar deck can be patched up easy, sir,"
spoke up Roger. "With some new tubes and a few rolls
of wire I could have her back in shape in no time."</p>

<p>"That goes for the control deck, too!" said Tom doggedly.
Then, after a quick glance at his unit mates, he
faced Connel squarely. "I think it goes without saying,
sir, that we'd appreciate it very much if you could recommend
that she be restored instead of junked."</p>

<p>Connel allowed himself a smile in the face of such
obvious love for the ship. "You forget that to repair her
out in space, the parts have to be hauled from Venus.
But I'll see what I can do. Meantime, Roger, see if you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>can't get that patrol ship to give us a lift to Venusport.
Tell the C.O. I'm aboard and on urgent official business."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Roger.</p>

<p>"And," continued the spaceman, noticing the downcast
looks of Tom and Astro, "it wouldn't hurt if you
two started repairing as much as you can. So when the
maintenance crew arrives, they won't find her in such
a mess."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" chorused the two cadets happily.</p>

<p>Connel returned to his quarters and sat down heavily
in the remains of his bunk, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
Somehow, word had gotten out that he was going
to check on the secret organization on Venus and someone
had made a bold and desperate attempt to stop him
before he could get started. It infuriated him to think
that anyone would interrupt official business. As far as
Connel was concerned, nothing came before official
business. And he was doubly furious at the danger to
the three cadets, who had innocently hitched a ride on
what was almost a death ship. Someone was going to
pay, Connel vowed, clenching his huge fists&mdash;and pay
dearly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4" id="CHAPTER_4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>


<p>"<i>Yeeooowww!</i>"</p>

<p>Roaring with jubilation and jumping high in the air
at every other step, Astro raced out of the gigantic maintenance
hangar at the Venusport spaceport and charged
at his two unit mates waiting on the concrete apron.</p>

<p>"Everything's O.K.," he yelled, throwing his arms
around them. "The <i>Polaris</i> is going to be brought in for
full repairs! I just saw the audiograph report from the
maintenance chief!"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger broke into loud cheers and pounded
each other on the back.</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter," gasped Roger, "I feel as though I've
been sitting up with a sick friend!"</p>

<p>"Your friend's going to make a full recovery," asserted
Astro.</p>

<p>"Did you see Major Connel?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Astro. "I think he had a lot to do with it.
I saw him talking to the head maintenance officer."</p>

<p>"Well, now that we've sweated the old girl through
the crisis," asserted Roger, "how's about us concentrating
on our vacation?"</p>

<p>"Great," agreed Tom. "This is your party, Astro. Lead
the way."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>The three cadets left the spaceport in a jet cab and
rode happily into the city of Venusport. As they slid
along the superhighway toward the first and largest of
the Venusian cities, Astro pointed out the sights. Like
slim fingers of glass, the towering Titan crystal buildings
of the city arose before them, reaching above the
misty atmosphere to catch the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Where do we get our safari gear, Astro?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"In the secondhand shops along Spaceman's Row,"
replied the big Venusian. "We can get good equipment
down there at half the price."</p>

<p>The cab turned abruptly off the main highway and
began twisting through a section of the city shunned
by the average Venusian citizen. Spaceman's Row had
a long and unsavory history. For ten square blocks it
was the hide-out and refuge of the underworld of space.
The grimy stores and shadowy buildings supplied the
needs of the countless shadowy figures who lived beyond
the law and moved as silently as ghosts.</p>

<p>Leaving the jet cab, the three cadets walked along
the streets, past the cheaply decorated store fronts and
dingy hallways, until they finally came to a corner shop
showing the universal symbol of the pawnshop: three
golden balls. Tom and Roger looked at Astro who nodded,
and they stepped inside.</p>

<p>The interior of the shop was filthy. Rusted and worn
space gear was piled in heaps along the walls and on
dusty counters. An old-fashioned multiple neon light
fixture cast an eerie blue glow over everything. Roger
grimaced as he looked around. "Are you sure we're in
the right place, Astro?"</p>

<p>Tom winked. Roger had a reputation for being fastidious.</p>

<p>"This is it," nodded Astro. "I know the old geezer that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>runs this place. Nice guy. Name's Spike." He turned to
the back of the shop and bawled, "Hey, Spike! Customers!"</p>

<p>Out of the gloomy darkness a figure emerged slowly.
"Yeah?" The man stepped out into the pale light. He
dragged one foot as he walked. "Whaddaya want?"</p>

<p>Astro looked puzzled. "Where's Spike?" he asked.
"Doesn't Spike Freyer own this place?"</p>

<p>"He died a couple months ago. I bought him out just
before." The crippled man eyed the three cadets warily.
"Wanna buy something?"</p>

<p>Astro looked shocked. "Spike, dead? What happened?"</p>

<p>"How should I know," snarled the little man. "I
bought him out and he died a few weeks later. Now,
you wanna buy something or not?"</p>

<p>"We're looking for jungle gear," said Tom, puzzled by
the man's strange belligerence.</p>

<p>"Jungle gear?" the man's eyes widened. "Going hunting?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," supplied Roger. "We need complete outfits
for three. But you don't look like you have them. Let's
go, fellas." He turned toward the door, anxious to get
out into the open air.</p>

<p>"Just a minute! Just a minute, Cadet," said the proprietor
eagerly. "I've got some fine hunting gear here!
A little used, but you won't mind that! Save you at least
half on anything you'd buy up in the city." He started
toward the back of the store and then paused. "Where
you going hunting?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"So I'll know what kind of gear you need. Light&mdash;heavy&mdash;kind
of guns&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jungle belt in the Eastern Hemisphere," supplied
Astro.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>"Big game?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Tyrannosaurus."</p>

<p>"Tyranno, eh?" nodded the little man. "Well, now,
you'll need heavy stuff for that. I'd say at least three
heavy-duty paralo-ray pistols for side arms, and three
shock rifles. Then you'll need camping equipment, synthetics,
and all the rest." He counted the items off on
grubby little fingers.</p>

<p>"Let's take a look at the blasters," said Tom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-048.png" width="500" height="428" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Right this way," said the man. He turned and limped
to the rear of the shop, followed by the three cadets.
Opening a large cabinet, he pulled out a heavy rifle, a
shock gun that could knock out any living thing at a
range of a thousand yards, and stun the largest animal
at twice the distance.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>"This blaster will knock the scales off any tyranno
that you hit," he said, handing the weapon over to Tom
who expertly broke it down and examined it.</p>

<p>As Tom checked the gun, the proprietor turned to the
other cadets casually.</p>

<p>"Why would three cadets want to go into that section
of the jungle belt?"</p>

<p>"We just told you," said Roger. "We're hunting tyranno."</p>

<p>"Uh, yes, of course." He turned away and pulled three
heavy-duty paralo-ray pistols out of the cabinet. "Now
these ray guns are the finest money can buy. Standard
Solar Guard equipment...."</p>

<p>"Where did you get them?" demanded Roger sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, you know how it is, Cadet." The man laughed.
"One way or another, we get a lot of gear. A man is
discharged from the Solar Guard and he can keep his
equipment, then he gets hard up for a few credits and
so he comes to me."</p>

<p>Tom closed the shock rifle and turned to Astro. "This
gun is clean enough. Think it can stop a tyranno,
Astro?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the big cadet confidently. "Easy."</p>

<p>"O.K.," announced Tom, turning back to the proprietor.
"Give us the rest of the stuff."</p>

<p>"And watch your addition when you make out the
bill," said Roger blandly. "We can add, too."</p>

<p>A half-hour later the three cadets stood in front of the
shop with all the gear they would need and hailed a
jet cab. They stowed their newly purchased equipment
inside and started to climb in as Astro announced,
"Spaceport, driver!"</p>

<p>"Huh?" Roger paused. "Why back there?"</p>

<p>"How do you think we're going to get to the jungle
belt?" asked Astro. "Walk?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, no, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have to rent a jet launch," said Astro. "Or try to
buy a used one that we can sell back again. Pile in,
now!"</p>

<p>As the cab shot away from the curb with the three
cadets, the proprietor of the pawnshop stepped out of
the doorway and watched it disappear, a puzzled frown
on his face. Quickly he re-entered the shop, and limping
to a small locker in the rear, opened it, exposing the
screen of a teleceiver. He flipped on the switch, tuned it
carefully, and in a moment the screen glowed to life.</p>

<p>"Hello, this is the shop," called the little man.
"Lemme speak to Lactu! This is urgent!" As he waited
he stared out through the dirty window to the street
where the cadets had been a moment before and he
smiled thinly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Arriving at the spaceport, Astro led his unit mates to
a privately owned repair hangar and dry dock where
wealthier Venusian citizens kept their space yachts, jet-powered
craft, and small runabouts. Astro opened the
door to the office with a bang, and a young girl, operating
an automatic typewriter, looked up.</p>

<p>"Astro!" she cried. "How wonderful to see you!"</p>

<p>"Hiya, Agnes," replied Astro shyly. The big cadet was
well known and liked at the repair hangar. His early
life had been spent in and around the spaceport. First
just listening to the stories of the older spacemen and
running errands for them, then lending a helping hand
wherever he could, and finally becoming a rigger and
mechanic. This all preceded his years as an enlisted
spaceman and his eventual appointment to Space Academy.
His big heart and honesty, his wild enthusiasm
for any kind of rocket power had won him many
friends.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>"Is Mr. Keene around?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"He's with a customer right now," replied Agnes.
"He'll be out in a minute." Her eyes swept past Astro
to Tom and Roger who were standing in the doorway.
"Who are your friends?"</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me!" mumbled Astro. "These are my unit
mates, Cadet Corbett and Cadet Manning."</p>

<p>Before Tom could acknowledge the introduction,
Roger stepped in front of him and sat on the edge of the
desk. Looking into her eyes, he announced, "Tell you
what, Astro, you and Tom go hunting. I've found all I
could ever want to find right here. Tell me, my little
space pet, are you engaged for dinner tonight?"</p>

<p>Agnes looked back into his eyes innocently. "As a
matter of fact I am." Then, grinning mischievously, she
added, "But don't let that stop you."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't let a tyranno stop me," bragged the blond-haired
cadet. "Tell me who your previous engagement
is with and I'll get rid of him in nothing flat!"</p>

<p>The girl giggled and looked past Roger. He turned to
see a tall, solidly built man in coveralls scowling at him.</p>

<p>"Friend of yours, Agnes?" the newcomer asked.</p>

<p>"Friend of Astro's, Roy," said Agnes. "Cadet Manning,
I'd like you to meet my brother, Roy Keene."</p>

<p>Roger jumped up and stuck out his hand. "Oh&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;how
do you do, sir?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, Cadet," replied Keene gruffly, but with a
slight twinkle in his eye. He turned to Astro and gripped
the big cadet's hand solidly. "Well, Astro, it's good to
see you. How's everything going at Space Academy?"</p>

<p>"Swell, sir," replied Astro, and after introducing Tom
and bringing Keene up to date on his life history, he
explained the purpose of their visit. "We're on summer
leave, sir, and we'd like to go hunting tyrannosaurus.
But what we need most right now is a jet boat. We'd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>like to rent one, or if you've got something cheap, we'd
buy it."</p>

<p>Keene rubbed his chin. "I'm afraid I can't help you,
Astro. There's nothing available in the shop right now.
I'd lend you my Beetle, but one of the boys has it out
on a three-day repair job."</p>

<p>Astro's face fell. "Oh, that's too bad." He turned to
Tom and Roger. "Well, we could drop in from a stratosphere
cruiser and then work our way back to the nearest
colony in three or four weeks."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" exclaimed Keene. "I've got an idea."
He turned and called to a man standing on the other
side of the hangar, studying a radar scanner for private
yachts. "Hey, Rex, mind coming over here a minute."</p>

<p>The man walked over. He was in his late thirties, tall
and broad-shouldered, his hair was almost snow-white,
contrasting sharply with his deeply tanned and handsome
features.</p>

<p>"This is the <i>Polaris</i> unit from Space Academy, Rex,"
said Keene. "Boys, meet Rex Sinclair." After the introductions
were completed, Keene explained the cadets'
situation. Sinclair broke into a smile. "It would be a
pleasure to have you three boys as my guests!"</p>

<p>"Guests!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>Sinclair nodded. "I have a plantation right on the
edge of the jungle belt. Things get pretty dull down
there in the middle of the summer. I'd be honored if
you'd use my home as a base of operations while you
hunt for your tyrannosaurus. As a matter of fact, you'd
be helping me out. Those brutes destroy a lot of my
crops and we have to go after them every three or four
years."</p>

<p>"Well, thanks," said Tom, "but we wouldn't want to
impose. We'd be happy to pay you&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>Sinclair held up his hand. "Wouldn't think of it. Do
you have your gear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Astro. "Arms, synthetics, the works.
Everything but transportation."</p>

<p>"Well, that's sitting out on the spaceport. That black
space yacht on Ramp Three." Sinclair smiled. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's note: original lacked the opening quote mark.">"Get</ins> your
gear aboard and make yourselves at home. I'll be ready
to blast off in half an hour."</p>

<p>Astro turned to Keene. "Thanks a lot, sir. It was swell
of you to set us up this way."</p>

<p>Keene slapped him on the shoulder. "Go on. Have a
good time."</p>

<p>Shaking hands all around and saying quick good-bys,
the three boys hurried out to stow their gear aboard
Sinclair's luxurious space yacht. While Roger and Tom
relaxed in the comfortable main cabin, Astro hurried
below to inspect the power deck.</p>

<p>Roger laughed as the big cadet disappeared down
the hatch. "That guy would rather play with a rocket
tube than do anything else in the universe!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom. "He's a real lucky guy."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Ever meet anyone that didn't love that big hick?"</p>

<p>"Nope," said Roger with a sly grin. "And that goes for
me too! But don't you ever tell him!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Major Connel had been waiting to see the Solar Alliance
Delegate from Venus for three hours. And Major
Connel didn't like to wait for anyone or anything.
He had read every magazine in the lavish outer office
atop the Solar Guard Building in downtown Venusport,
drunk ten glasses of water, and was now wearing a path
in the rug as he paced back and forth in front of the
secretary who watched him shyly.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>The buzzer on the desk finally broke the silence and
the girl answered quickly as Connel stopped and glared
at her expectantly. She listened for a second, then replacing
the receiver, turned to the seething Solar Guard
officer and smiled sweetly. "Delegate James will see you
now, Major."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Connel gruffly, trying hard not to
take his impatience out on the pretty girl. He stepped
toward an apparently solid wall that suddenly slid back
as he passed a light beam and entered the spacious
office of E. Philips James, Venusian Delegate to the
Grand Council of the Solar Alliance.</p>

<p>E. Philips James was a small man, with small hands
that were moving nervously all the time. His head was a
little too large for his narrow body that was clothed in
the latest fashion, and his tiny black mustache was carefully
trimmed. As Connel stalked into the room, James
bounced out of his chair to meet him, smiling warmly.</p>

<p>"Major Connel! How delightful to see you again," he
said, extending a perfumed hand.</p>

<p>"You could have seen me a lot sooner," growled Connel.
"I've been sitting outside for over three hours!"</p>

<p>James lifted one eyebrow and sat down without making
any comment. A true diplomat, E. Philips James
never said anything unless it was absolutely necessary.
And when he spoke, he never really said very much. He
sat back and waited patiently for Connel to cool off and
get to the point of his call.</p>

<p>In typical fashion, Connel jumped to it without any
idle conversational prologue. "I'm here on a security assignment.
I need confidential information."</p>

<p>"Just one moment, Major," said James. He flipped
open his desk intercom and called to his secretary outside.
"Record this conversation, please."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>"Record!" roared Connel. "I just told you this was
secret!"</p>

<p>"It will be secret, Major," assured James softly. "The
record will go into the confidential files of the Alliance
for future reference. A precaution, Major. Standard procedure.
Please go on."</p>

<p>Connel hesitated, and then, shrugging his shoulders,
continued, "I want to know everything you know about
an organization here on Venus known as the Venusian
Nationalists."</p>

<p>James's expression changed slightly. "Specific information,
Major? Or just random bits of gossip?"</p>

<p>"No rocket wash, Mr. James. Information. Everything
you know!"</p>

<p>"I don't know why you've come to me," replied James,
visibly annoyed at the directness of the rough spaceman.
"I know really very little."</p>

<p>"I'm working under direct orders of Commander Walters,"
said Connel grimly, "who is also a delegate to the
Solar Council. His position as head of the Solar Guard
is equal to yours in every respect. This request comes
from his office, not out of my personal curiosity."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, of course, Major," replied James. "Of
course."</p>

<p>The delegate rose and walked over to the window,
seemingly trying to collect his thoughts. After a moment
he turned back. "Major, the organization you
speak of is, so far as I know, an innocent group of Venusian
farmers and frontier people who meet regularly to
exchange information about crops, prices, and the latest
farming methods. You see, Major"&mdash;James's voice took
on a slightly singsong tone, as though he were making
a speech&mdash;"Venus is a young planet, a vast new world,
with Venusport the only large metropolis and cultural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>center. Out in the wilderness, there are great tracts of
cultivated land that supply food to the planets of the
Solar Alliance and her satellites. We are becoming the
breadbasket of the universe, you might say." James
smiled at Connel, who did not return the smile.</p>

<p>"Great distances separate these plantations," continued
James. "Life is hard and lonely for the Venusian
plantation owner. The Venusian Nationalists are, to my
knowledge, no more than a group of landowners who
have gotten together and formed a club, a fraternity. It's
true they speak the Venusian dialect, these groups have
taken names from the old Venusian explorers, but I
hardly think it is worth while investigating."</p>

<p>"Do they have a headquarters?" Connel asked. "A
central meeting place?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know, they don't. But Al Sharkey, the
owner of the largest plantation on Venus, is the president
of the organization. He's a very amiable fellow.
Why don't you talk to him?"</p>

<p>"Al Sharkey, eh?" Connel made a mental note of the
name.</p>

<p>"And there's Rex Sinclair, a rather stubborn individualist
who wrote to me recently complaining that he
was being pressured into joining the organization."</p>

<p>"What kind of pressure?" asked Connel sharply.</p>

<p>James held up his hand. "Don't get me wrong, Major.
There was no violence." The delegate suddenly became
very businesslike. "I'm afraid that's all the information
I can give you, Major." He offered his hand. "So nice to
see you again. Please don't hesitate to call on me again
for any assistance you feel we can give you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. James," said Connel gruffly and left
the office, a frown creasing his forehead. Being a
straightforward person himself, Major Connel could not
understand why anyone would hesitate about answering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>a direct question. He didn't for a moment consider
the delegate anything but an intelligent man. It was
the rocket wash that went with being a diplomat that
annoyed the ramrod spaceman. He shrugged it off. Perhaps
he would find out something from Al Sharkey or
the other plantation owner, Rex Sinclair.</p>

<p>When he crossed the slidewalk and waited at the
curb for a jet cab, Connel suddenly paused and looked
around. He felt a strange excitement in the air&mdash;a kind
of tension. The faces of passing pedestrians seemed
strained, intense, their eyes were glowing, as though
they all were in on some huge secret. He saw groups of
men and women sitting in open sidewalk caf&eacute;s, leaning
over the table to talk to each other, their voices low and
guarded. Connel shivered. He didn't like it. Something
was happening on Venus and he had to find out what it
was before it was too late.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_5" id="CHAPTER_5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>


<p>"Wow!" exclaimed Roger.</p>

<p>"Jumping Jupiter!" commented Tom.</p>

<p>"Blast my jets!" roared Astro.</p>

<p>Rex Sinclair smiled as he maneuvered the sleek black
space yacht in a tight circle a thousand feet above the
Titan crystal roof of his luxurious home in the heart of
the wild Venusian jungle.</p>

<p>"She's built out of Venusian teak," said Sinclair. "Everything
but the roof. I wanted to keep the feeling of
the jungle around me, so I used the trees right out of
the jungle there." He pointed to the sea of dense tropical
growth that surrounded the house and cleared land.</p>

<p>The ship nosed up for a thousand yards and then
eased back, smoothly braked, to a concrete ramp a
thousand yards from the house. The touchdown was as
gentle as a falling leaf, and when Sinclair opened the
air lock, a tall man in worn but clean fatigues was waiting
for them.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Mr. Sinclair," he called, a smile on his lined,
weather-beaten face. "Have a good trip?"</p>

<p>"Fine trip, George," replied Sinclair, climbing out of
the ship. "I want you to meet some friends of mine.
Space Cadets Tom Corbett, Roger Manning, and Astro.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>They're going to stay with us during their summer leave
while they hunt for tyranno. Boys, this is my foreman,
George Hill."</p>

<p>The boys shook hands with the thick-set, muscular
man, who smiled broadly. "Glad to meet you, boys. Always
wanted to talk to someone from the Academy.
Wanted to go there myself but couldn't pass the physical.
Bad eyes."</p>

<p>Reaching into the ship, he began lifting out their
equipment. "You chaps go on up to the house now," he
said. "I'll take care of your gear."</p>

<p>With Sinclair leading the way, the boys slowly
walked up a flagstone path toward the house, and they
had their first chance to see a Venusian plantation home
at close range.</p>

<p>The Sinclair house stood in the middle of a clearing
more than five thousand yards square. At the edges, like
a solid wall of green vegetation, the Venusian jungle
rose more than two hundred feet. It was noon and the
heat was stifling. They were twenty-six million miles
closer to the sun, and on the equator of the misty planet.
While Astro, George, and Sinclair didn't seem to mind
the temperature, Tom and Roger were finding it unbearable.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine what it'll be like in the house with
that crystal roof!" whispered Roger.</p>

<p>"I'll bet," replied Tom. "But as soon as the sun drops
out of the zenith, it should cool off some."</p>

<p>When the group stepped up onto the porch, two
house servants met them and took their gear. Then Sinclair
and the foreman ushered the cadets inside. They
were surprised to feel a distinct drop in temperature.</p>

<p>"Your cooling unit must be pretty large, Mr. Sinclair,"
commented Tom, looking up at the crystal roof where
the sun was clearly visible.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>Sinclair smiled. "That's special crystal, mined on Titan
at a depth of ten thousand feet. It's tinted, and shuts
out the heat and glare of the sun."</p>

<p>George then left to lay out their gear for their first
hunt the next morning, and Sinclair took them on a
tour of the house. They walked through long corridors
looking into all the rooms, eventually winding up in the
kitchen, and the three boys marveled at the simplicity
yet absolute perfection of the place. Every modern convenience
was at hand for the occupant's comfort. When
the sun had dropped a little, they all put on sunglasses
with glareproof eye shields and walked around the
plantation. Sinclair showed them his prize-winning
stock and the vast fields of crops. Aside from the main
house, there were only four other buildings in the clearing.
They visited the smallest, a cowshed.</p>

<p>"Where do your field hands live, Mr. Sinclair?" asked
Tom, as they walked through the modern, spotless,
milking room.</p>

<p>"I don't have any," replied the planter. "Do most of
the work with machinery, and George and the houseboys
do what has to be done by hand."</p>

<p>As they left the shed and started back toward the
main house they came abreast of a small wooden structure.
Thinking they were headed there, Roger started
to open the door.</p>

<p>"Close that door!" snapped Sinclair. Roger jerked
back. Astro and Tom looked at the planter, startled by
the sharpness in his voice.</p>

<p>Sinclair smiled and explained, "We keep some experiments
on different kinds of plants in there at special low
temperatures. You might have let in hot air and ruined
something."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," said Roger. "I didn't know."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>"Forget it," replied the planter. "Well, let's get back
to the house. We're having an early dinner. You boys
have to get started at four o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"Four o'clock!" exclaimed Roger.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"We have to go deep into the thicket," Astro explained,
using the local term for the jungle, "so that at
high noon we can make camp and take a break. You
can't move out there at noon. It gets so hot you'd fall
on your face after fifteen minutes of fighting the creepers."</p>

<p>"Everything stops at noon," added Sinclair. "Even the
tyrannosaurus. You have to do your traveling in the cool
of the day, early and late. Six hours or so will take you
far enough away from the plantation to find tracks, if
there are any."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. Sinclair," asked Roger suddenly, "is this
the whole plantation?" He spread his hands in a wide
arc, taking in the clearing to the edge of the jungle.</p>

<p>Sinclair grinned. "Roger, it'd take a man two weeks
to go from one corner of my property to another. This
is just where I live. Three years ago I had five hundred
square miles under cultivation."</p>

<p>Back in the house, they found George setting the table
on the porch and his wife busy in the kitchen. Mrs.
Hill was a stout woman, with a pleasant face and a
ready smile. With very little ceremony, the cadets, Sinclair,
George, and his wife sat down to eat. The food
was simple fare, but the sure touch of Mrs. Hill's cooking
and the free use of delicate Venusian jungle spices
added exotic flavor, new but immensely satisfying to
the three hungry boys, a satisfaction they demonstrated
by cleaning their plates quickly and coming back for
second helpings. Astro, of course, was not happy until
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>he had polished off his fourth round. Mrs. Hill beamed
with pleasure at their unspoken compliment to her
cooking.</p>

<p>After the meal, Mrs. Hill stacked the dishes and put
them into a small carrier concealed in the wall. Pressing
a button, near the opening, she explained, "That dingus
takes them to the sink, washes them, dries them, and
puts everything in its right place. That's the kind of
modern living I like!"</p>

<p>As the sun dropped behind the wall of the jungle and
the sky darkened, they all relaxed. Sinclair and George
smoked contentedly, Mrs. Hill brought out some needle
point, and the three cadets rested in comfortable contour
chairs. They chatted idly, stopping only to listen
to the wild calls of birds and animals out in the jungle
as George, or Sinclair, identified them all. George told
of his experiences on tyrannosaurus hunts, and Astro
described his method of hunting as a boy.</p>

<p>"I was a big kid," he explained. "And since the only
way of earning a living was by working, I found I could
combine business with pleasure. I used to hitch rides
over the belt and parachute in to hunt for baby tyrannos."
He grinned and added, "When I think back, I
wonder how I ever stayed in one piece."</p>

<p>"Land sakes!" exclaimed Mrs. Hill. "It's a wonder
you weren't eaten alive! Those tyrannos are horrible
things."</p>

<p>"I was almost a meal once," confessed Astro sheepishly,
and at the urging of the others he described the
incident that had cured him of hunting alone in the
jungles of Venus with only a low-powered shock blaster.</p>

<p>"If I didn't get it at the base of the brain where the
nerve centers aren't so well protected with the first
shot, I was in trouble," he said. "I took a lot of chances,
but was careful not to tangle with a mama or papa tyrannosaurus.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>I'd stalk the young ones. I'd wait for him
to feed and then let him have it. If I was lucky, I'd get
him with one shot, but most of the time I'd just stun
him and have to finish him off with a second blast. Then
I'd skin him, take the hams and shoulders, and get out
of there fast before the wild dogs got wind of the blood.
I'd usually hunt pretty close to a settlement where I
could get the meat frozen. After that, I'd just have to
call a couple of the big restaurants in Venusport and
get the best price. I used to make as much as fifty credits
on one kill."</p>

<p>"How would you get the meat to Venusport?" asked
Roger, who, for all his braggadocio, was awed by his
unit mate's calm bravery and skill as a hunter.</p>

<p>"The restaurant that bought it would send a jet boat
out for it and I'd ride back with it. After a while the
restaurant owners got to know me and would give me
regular orders. I was trying to fill a special order on
that last hunt."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Tom, equally impressed
with Astro's life as a boy hunter.</p>

<p>"I had just about finished hunting in a section near
a little settlement on the other side of Venus," began
the big cadet, "but I thought there might be one more
five-hundred-pound baby around, so I dropped in."
Astro paused and grinned. "I didn't find a baby, I found
his mother! She must have weighed twenty-five or
thirty tons. Biggest tyranno I've ever seen. She spotted
me the same time I saw her and I didn't even stop to
fire. I never could have dented her hide. I started running
and she came after me. I made it to a cave and
went as far back inside as I could. She stuck her head
in after me, and by the craters of Luna, she was only
about three feet away, with me backed up against a
wall. She tried to get farther in, opened her mouth, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>snapped and roared like twenty rocket cruisers going
off at once."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">
<img src="images/ill-064.png" width="393" height="500" alt="&quot;She tried to get farther into the cave.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;She tried to get farther into the cave.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Tom gulped and Roger's eyes widened.</p>

<p>"I figured there was only one thing to do," continued
Astro. "Use the blaster, even though it couldn't do much
damage. I let her have one right in the eye!" Astro
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>shook his head and laughed. "You should have seen her
pull her head out of that cave! I couldn't sleep for
months after that. I used to dream that she was sticking
her head in my window, always getting closer."</p>

<p>"Did the blaster do any damage at all?" asked Sinclair.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," said Astro. "I was close enough for the
heat charge from the muzzle to get her on the side
of the head. Nothing fatal, but she's probably still out
there in the jungle more ugly than ever with half a
face."</p>

<p>The group fell silent, each thinking of how he would
have reacted under similar conditions; each silently
thankful that it hadn't happened to him. Finally Mrs.
Hill rose and said good night, and George excused himself
to take a last look at the stock. Remembering their
early call for the next morning, the cadets said good
night to Sinclair and retired to their comfortable rooms.
In bed at last, each boy stretched full length on his bed
and in no time was sound asleep.</p>

<p>It was still dark, an hour and a half before the sun
would burst over the top of the jungle, when Sinclair
went to the cadets' room to rouse them. He found them
already up and dressed in their jungle garb. Each boy
was wearing skin-tight trousers and jerseys made of
double strength space-suit cloth and colored a dark
moldy green. A hunter dressed in this manner and
standing still could not be seen at twenty paces. The
snug fit of the suit was protection against thorns and
snags that could find no hold on the hard, smooth-surfaced
material.</p>

<p>After a hearty breakfast the three cadets collected
their gear, the paralo-ray pistols, the shock rifles, and
the small shoulder packs of synthetic food and camping
equipment. Each boy also carried a two-foot jungle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>knife with a compass inlaid in the handle. A helmet of
clear plastic with a small mesh-covered opening in the
face covered each boy's head. Dressed as they were,
they could walk through the worst part of the jungles
and not get so much as a scratch.</p>

<p>"Well," commented Sinclair, looking them over, "I
guess you boys have everything. I'd hate to be the tyranno
that crosses your path!"</p>

<p>The boys grinned. "Thanks for everything, sir," said
Tom. "You've been a lot of help."</p>

<p>"Think nothing of it, Tom. Just bring back a pair of
tyranno scalps!"</p>

<p>"Where are Mr. and Mrs. Hill?" asked Astro. "We'd
like to say good-by to them."</p>

<p>"They left before you got up," replied Sinclair.
"They're taking a few days off for a visit to Venusport."</p>

<p>The boys pulled on their jungle boots. Knee-length
and paper-thin, they were nonetheless unpenetrable
even if the boys should step on one of the needle-sharp
ground thorns.</p>

<p>They waved a last good-by to their host, standing on
the steps of the big house, and moved across the clearing
to the edge of the jungle wall.</p>

<p>As the cadets approached the thick tangle of vines,
the calls and rustling noises from the many crawling
things hidden in the forbidding thicket slowly died
down. They walked along the edge of the tangle of
jungle creepers until they found an opening and stepped
through.</p>

<span class="caption">They were completely surrounded by the jungle</span>
</div>

<p>After walking only ten feet they were completely
surrounded by the jungle and could not even see the
clearing they had just left. It was dark, the network of
vines, the thick tree trunks and rank growing vegetation
shutting out the sun, leaving the interior of the
jungle strangely plunged in gloom. Astro moved ahead,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>followed by Roger, with Tom bringing up the rear.
They followed the path they had entered, as far as it
went, and then began cutting their way through the
underbrush, stopping only to cut notches in the trees to
mark their passage.</p>

<p>Their long-bladed knives slicing through vines and
brush easily, Tom, Roger, and Astro hacked their way
deeper and deeper into the mysterious and suffocating
green world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_6" id="CHAPTER_6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>


<p>"I guess that's the Sharkey place over there," mumbled
Major Connel to himself, banking his jet launch over
the green jungles and pointing the speedy little craft's
nose toward the clearing in the distance. The Solar
Guard officer wrenched the scout around violently in
his approach. He was still boiling over the Venusian
Delegate's indifference toward his mission.</p>

<p>The launch skimmed the jungle treetops and glided
to a perfect stop near the largest of a group of farm
buildings. Cutting the motors, Connel sat and waited
for someone to appear. He sat there for ten minutes but
no one came out to greet him. Finally he climbed out
of the launch and stood by the hatch, peering intently
at the buildings around him, his eyes squinting against
the glare of the fiery sun overhead. The plantation
seemed deserted. Reaching back into the launch and
pulling out a paralo-ray gun, he strapped its reassuring
bulk to his side and stepped toward the building that
was obviously the main house. Nothing else moved in
the hot noon sun.</p>

<p>As he strode purposefully toward the house, eyes
alert for any sign of life, he thought for a moment everyone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>might be taking a midday nap. Many of the Venusian
colonists adapted the age-old custom of the tropics
to escape the intense heat of midday. But he dismissed
the thought immediately, realizing that his approach
in the jet would have awakened the deepest of sleepers.</p>

<p>Entering the house, he stopped in the spacious front
hall and called:</p>

<p>"Hello! Anybody home? Halloo!"</p>

<p>The only answer was the echo of his own voice, vibrating
through the large rooms.</p>

<p>"Funny," muttered the spaceman. "Why is this place
deserted?"</p>

<p>He walked slowly through the house, opening doors
and looking into all the rooms, searching the whole
place thoroughly before returning to the clearing. Going
to the nearest of the outbuildings, he opened one of
the wide doors and stared into the gloomy interior. With
his experienced eye he saw immediately that the building
had been used to house a large jet craft. There was
the slightly pungent odor of jet fuel, and on the floor
the tire marks of a dolly used to roll the craft out to the
launching strip. He followed the tracks outside and
around to the side of the building where he saw the
dolly. It was empty.</p>

<p>Shaking his head grimly, Connel made a quick tour
of the remaining buildings. They were all deserted but
the last one, which seemed to be built a little more
sturdily than the others. Unlike the others, it was
locked. He looked for a window and discovered that the
walls were solid. There were no openings except the
locked door. He hesitated in front of the door, looking
down at the ground for a sign of what might have been
stored in the building. The surrounding area revealed
no tracks. He pulled out a thick-bladed pocketknife and
stepped to the lock, then suddenly stopped and grinned.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>"Great," he said to himself. "A Solar Guard officer
about to break into private property without a warrant.
Fine thing to have known back at the Academy!"</p>

<p>He turned abruptly and strode back to the scout.
Climbing into the craft, he picked up the audioscriber
microphone and recorded a brief message. Removing
the threadlike tape from the machine, he returned to
the house and left it on the spool of the audioscribe-replay
machine near the front door.</p>

<p>A few moments later the eerie silence of the Sharkey
plantation was once again shattered by the hissing roar
of jets as the launch took off and climbed rapidly over
the jungle. Air-borne, Connel glanced briefly at a chart,
changed course, and sent the launch hurtling at full
speed across the jungle toward the Sinclair plantation.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"How far do you think we've come?" asked Tom
sleepily.</p>

<p>Astro yawned and stretched before answering. "I'd
say about fifteen miles, Tom."</p>

<p>"Seems more like a hundred and fifteen," moaned
Roger who was sprawled on the ground. "I ache all over.
Start at the top of my head and work down, and you
won't find one square inch that isn't sore."</p>

<p>Tom grinned. He was tired himself, but the three-day
march through the jungle had been three of the most
exciting days in his life. Coming from a large city where
he had to travel two hours by monorail to get to open
green country, the curly-haired cadet found this passage
through the wildest jungle in the solar system new
and fascinating. He had seen flowers of every color in
the spectrum, some as large as himself; giant shrubs
with leaves so fine that they looked like spider webs;
Venusian teakwood trees fifty to a hundred feet thick
at the base with some twisted into strange spirals as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>their trunks, shaded by another larger tree, sought a
clear avenue to the sun. There were bushes that grew
thorns three inches long, hard as steel and thin as needles;
jungle creepers, vines two and three feet thick,
twisting around tree trunks and strangling them. He
saw animals too, all double the size of anything on
Earth because of the lighter Venusian gravity; insects
the size of rats, rats the size of dogs, and wild dogs the
size of ponies. Up in the trees, small anthropoids, cousins
to the monkeys of Earth, scampered from limb to
limb, screaming at the invaders of their jungle home.
Smooth-furred animals that looked like deer, their horns
curling overhead, scampered about the cadets like puppies,
nuzzling them, nipping at their heels playfully,
and barking as though in laughter when Astro roared
at them for getting in the way.</p>

<p>But there were dangerous creatures in the jungle too;
the beautiful but deadly poisonous brush snakes that
lurked unseen in the varicolored foliage, striking out at
anything that passed; animals resembling chipmunks
with enlarged razor-sharp fangs, whose craving for raw
meat was so great that they would attack an animal ten
times its size; lizards the size of elephants with scales
like armor plate that rooted in swampy ground for their
food, but which would attack any intruder, charging
with amazing speed, their three horns poised; and, finally,
there were the monsters of Venus&mdash;giant beasts
whose weights were measured in tons, ruled over by
the most horrible of them all&mdash;the tyrannosaurus.</p>

<p>Fights to death between the jungle creatures were
common sights for the boys during their march. They
saw a weird soundless fight between a forty-foot snake
and a giant vulture with talons nearly two feet across
and a beak resembling a mammoth nutcracker. The
vulture won, methodically cutting the reptile's body
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>into sections, its beak slicing through the snake as easily
as a knife going through butter.</p>

<p>More than once Astro spotted a dangerous creature,
and telling Roger and Tom to stand back, he would
level his shock rifle and blast it.</p>

<p>So far they had seen nothing of their prey&mdash;the tyrannosaurus.
Tracks around the steaming swamps were
as close as they had come. Once, late in the evening of
the second day they caught a fleeting glimpse of a
plant-eating brontosaurus lumbering through the brush.</p>

<p>All three of the boys had found it difficult to sleep in
the jungle. The first two nights they had taken turns at
staying on guard and tending the campfire. Nothing had
bothered them, and on the third night out, they decided
the fire would be enough to scare off the jungle animals.
It was risky, but the continual fight through the jungle
underbrush had tired the three boys to the bone and
the few hours they stood guard were sorely missed the
next day, so they decided to chance it.</p>

<p>Roger was already asleep. Astro had just finished
checking his rifle to be ready for instant fire, when Tom
threw the last log on the campfire and crawled into his
sleeping bag.</p>

<p>"Think it'll be all right, Astro?" asked Tom. "I'm not
anxious to wake up inside one of these critter's stomachs."</p>

<p>"Most of them have never seen fire, Tom," Astro said
reassuringly. "It scares them. Besides, we're getting
close to the big stuff now. You might see a tyranno or a
big bronto any time. And if they come along, you'll
hear 'em, believe me. They're about as quiet as a squadron
of cruisers on battle emergency blasting off from
the Academy in the middle of the night!"</p>

<p>"O.K.," replied Tom. "You're the hunter in this crew."
Suddenly he laughed. "You know I really got a bang out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>of the way Roger jumped back from that waddling
ground bird yesterday."</p>

<p>Astro grinned. "Yeah, the one thing in this place that's
as ferocious as a kitten and he pulls his ray gun like an
ancient cowboy!"</p>

<p>A very tired voice spoke up from the other sleeping
bag. "Is that so! Well, when you two brave men came
face to face with that baby lizard on a tree root, you
were ready to finish your leave in Atom City!" Roger
unzipped the end of the bag, stuck his blond head out,
and gave his unit mates a sour look. "Sack in, will you?
Your rocket wash is keeping me awake!"</p>

<p>Laughing, Astro and Tom nodded good night to each
other and closed their sleeping bags. The jungle was
still, the only movement being the leaping tongues of
flame from the campfire.</p>

<p>An hour later it began to rain, a light drizzle at first
that increased until it reached the steady pounding of
a tropical downpour. Tom awoke first, opening the flap
of his sleeping bag only to get his face full of slimy water
that spilled in. Spluttering and coughing he sat up
and saw that the campfire was out and the campsite
was already six inches deep in water.</p>

<p>"Roger, Astro!" he called and slapped the nearest
sleeping bag. Astro opened the flap a little and peered
out sleepily. Instantly he rolled out of the bag and
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Wake Roger up!" he snapped. "We've got to get out
of here!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Roger mumbled through the
bag, not opening it. "Why the excitement over a little
rain?"</p>

<p>"The fire's out, hotshot," said Astro. "It's as dark as
the inside of a cow's number-four belly. We've got to
move!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why?" asked Tom, not understanding the big cadet's
sudden nervous excitement. "What's the matter
with staying right where we are? Why go trooping
around in the dark?"</p>

<p>"We can't light a fire anywhere," added Roger, finally
sticking his head out of his sleeping bag.</p>

<p>"We've got to get on high ground!" said Astro, hurriedly
packing the camping equipment. "We're in a
hollow here. The rain really comes down on Venus, and
in another hour this place will be a pond!"</p>

<p>Sensing the urgency in Astro's voice, Roger began
packing up his equipment and in a few moments the
three boys had their gear slung over their shoulders and
were slogging through water already knee-deep.</p>

<p>"I still don't see why we have to go tracking through
the jungle in the middle of the night," grumbled Roger.
"We could climb up a tree and wait out the storm."</p>

<p>"You'd have to wait long after the rain stops," replied
Astro. "There is one thing in this place nothing ever
gets enough of, and that's water. Animals know it and
hang around all the water holes. If a small animal tries
to get a drink, he more than likely winds up in something's
stomach. When it rains like this, hollows fill up
like the one we just left, and everything within running,
hopping, and crawling distance heads for it to get a
bellyful of water. In another hour our camp will be like
something out of a nightmare, with every animal in the
jungle coming down for a drink and starting to fight
one another."</p>

<p>"Then if we stayed there&mdash;" Roger stopped.</p>

<p>"We'd be in the middle of it," said Astro grimly. "We
wouldn't last two minutes."</p>

<p>Walking single file, with Astro in the lead, followed
by Roger and then Tom, they stumbled through the
pitch-black darkness. Astro refused to shine a light, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>fear of being attacked by a desperate animal, more eager
for water than afraid of the light. They carried
their shock blasters cocked and ready to fire. The rain
continued, increasing in fury until they were enveloped
in a nearly solid wall of water. In a little while the floor
of the jungle became one continuous mudhole, with
each step taking them ankle-deep into the sucking mud.
Their climb was uphill, and the water from above increased,
washing down around them in torrents. More
than once one of the cadets fell, gasping for breath, into
the dirty water, only to be jerked back to more solid
footing by the other two. Stumbling, their hands groping
wildly in the dark, they pushed forward.</p>

<p>They were reaching higher ground when Astro
stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>The boys stood still, the rain pounding down on their
plastic headgear, holding rifles ready and straining their
ears for some sound other than the drumming of rain.</p>

<p>"I don't hear anything," said Roger.</p>

<p>"<i>Shhh!</i>" hissed Astro.</p>

<p>They waited, and then from a distance they heard
the faint crashing of underbrush. Gradually it became
more distinct until there was no mistaking its source.
A large monster was moving through the jungle near
them!</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Tom, trying to keep his voice
calm.</p>

<p>"A big one," said Astro. "A real big one. And I think
it's heading this way!"</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" gasped Roger. "What do we
do?"</p>

<p>"We either run, or stay here and try to blast it."</p>

<p>"Whatever you say, Astro," said Roger. "You're the
boss."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>"Same here," said Tom. "Call it."</p>

<p>Astro did not answer right away. He strained his ears,
listening to the movements of the advancing monster,
trying to ascertain the exact direction the beast was
taking. The noise became more violent, the crashing
more sharply defined as small trees were crushed to the
ground.</p>

<p>"If only I knew exactly what it is!" said Astro desperately.
"If it's a tyranno, it walks on its hind legs and
has its head way up in the trees, and could pass within
ten feet of us and not see us. But if it's a bronto, it has a
long snakelike neck that he pokes all around and he
wouldn't miss us at a hundred feet!"</p>

<p>"Make up your mind quick, big boy," said Roger. "If
that thing gets any closer, I'm opening up with this
blaster. He might eat me, but I'll sure make his teeth
rattle first!"</p>

<p>The ground began to shake as the approaching monster
came nearer. Astro remained still, ears straining for
some sound to indicate exactly what was crashing down
on them.</p>

<p>Above them, the shrill scream of an anthropoid suddenly
pierced the dark night as its tree home was sent
crashing to the ground. There was a growing roar and
the crashing stopped momentarily.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here," said Astro tensely. "That's a
tyranno, but he's down on all fours now, looking for
that monkey! Keep together and make as little noise
as you can. No talking. Keep your blasters and emergency
lights ready. If he discovers us, you shine the
light on his face Roger, and Tom and I will shoot.
O.K.?"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger agreed.</p>

<p>"All right," said Astro, "let's go&mdash;and spaceman's
luck!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_7" id="CHAPTER_7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>


<p>"What can I do for you, Officer?"</p>

<p>Connel heaved his bulk out of the jet launch and
looked hard at the man standing in front of him. "You
Rex Sinclair?"</p>

<p>Sinclair nodded. "That's right."</p>

<p>Connel offered his hand. "Major Connel, Solar
Guard."</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you," replied the planter, gripping the
spaceman's hand. "Have something to cool you off."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Connel. "I can use it. Whew! Must be
at least one twenty in the shade."</p>

<p>Sinclair chuckled. "This way, Major."</p>

<p>They didn't say anything more until Connel was resting
comfortably in a deep chair, admiring the crystal
roof of Sinclair's house. After a pleasant exchange about
crops and problems of farming on Venus, the gruff
spaceman squared his back and stared straight at his
host. "Mr. James, the Solar Delegate, told me you've resisted
pressure to join the Venusian Nationalists."</p>

<p>Sinclair's expression changed slightly. His eyebrows
lifting quizzically. "Why&mdash;yes, that's true."</p>

<p>"I'd like you to tell me what you know about the organization."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>"I see," mused Sinclair. "Is that an order?" he added,
chuckling.</p>

<p>"That's a request. I'd like to learn as much about the
Nationalists as possible."</p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>Connel paused and then said casually, "A spot check.
The Solar Guard likes to keep its eyes open for trouble."</p>

<p>"Trouble?" exclaimed Sinclair. "You're not serious!"</p>

<p>Connel nodded his head. "It's probably nothing but
a club. However, I'd like to get some facts on it."</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to anyone else?" asked Sinclair.</p>

<p>"I just came from the Sharkey plantation. It's deserted.
Not a soul around. I'll drop back by there before
I return to Venusport." Connel paused and looked
squarely at Sinclair. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I don't know much about them, Major," replied the
planter. "It always seemed to me nothing more than a
group of planters getting together&mdash;"</p>

<p>Connel cut him off. "Possibly, but why didn't you
join?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aren't all your friends in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I just don't have time. I have a big place,
and there's only me and my foreman and housekeeper
now. All the field hands left some time ago."</p>

<p>"Where'd they go?"</p>

<p>"Venusport, I guess. Can't get people to farm these
days."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Sinclair," declared Connel, "let's lay
our cards on the table. I know how you must feel talking
about your friends, but this is really important. Vitally
important to every citizen in the Solar Alliance.
Suppose the Nationalists were really a tight organization
with a purpose&mdash;a purpose of making Venus independent
of the Solar Alliance. If they succeeded, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Venus did break away, Mercury might follow, then
Mars&mdash;the whole system fall apart&mdash;break up into independent
states. And when that happens, there's trouble&mdash;customs
barriers, jealousies, individual armies and
navies, and then, ultimately, a space war. It's more than
just friendship, Sinclair, it's the smallest crack in the
solid front of the Solar Alliance, but it's a crack that <i>can</i>
be opened further if we don't stop it now."</p>

<p>Sinclair was impressed. "Very well, Major, I'll tell
you everything I know about them. And you're right,
it is hard to talk about your friends. I've grown up here
in the Venusian jungle. I helped my father clear this
land where the house is built. Most of the men in the
Nationalists are friends of mine, but"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"you're
right, I can't allow this to happen to the Solar
Alliance."</p>

<p>"Allow what to happen?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"Just what you said, about Venus becoming an independent
state."</p>

<p>"Tell me all you know," said Connel.</p>

<p>"The group began to form about three years ago. Al
Sharkey came over here one night and said a group of
the planters were getting together every so often to exchange
information about crops and farming conditions.
I went a few times, we all did, on this part of Venus.
At first it was fun. We even had picnics and barn
dances every three or four weeks. Then one night someone
suggested we come dressed in old costumes&mdash;the
type worn by our forefathers who founded Venus."</p>

<p>Connel nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, one thing led to another," continued Sinclair.
"They started talking about the great history of our
planet, and complaining about paying taxes to support
the Solar Alliance. Instead of opening up new colonies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>like the one out on Pluto, we should develop our
own planet. We stopped dancing, the women stopped
coming, and then one night we elected a president. Al
Sharkey. The first thing he did was order all members
to attend meetings in the dress of our forefathers. He
gave the organization a name, the Venusian Nationalists.
Right after that, I stopped going. I got tired of listening
to speeches about the wonderful planet we live
on, and how terrible it was to be governed by men on
Earth, millions of miles away."</p>

<p>"Didn't they consider that they had equal representation
in the Solar Alliance Chamber?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"No, Major. There wasn't anything you could say to
any of them. If you tried to reason with them, they
called you a&mdash;a&mdash;" Sinclair stopped and turned away.</p>

<p>"What did they call you?" demanded Connel, getting
madder by the minute.</p>

<p>"Anyone that disagreed with them was called an
Earthling."</p>

<p>"And you disagreed?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"I quit," said Sinclair stoutly. "And right after that,
I started losing livestock. I found them dead in the
pens, poisoned. And some of my crops were burned."</p>

<p>"Did you protest to the Solar Guard?"</p>

<p>"Of course, but there wasn't any proof any one of my
neighbors had done it. They don't bother me any more,
but they don't speak to me either. It's as though I had
a horrible disease. There hasn't been a guest in this
house in nearly two years. Three space cadets are the
first visitors here since I quit the organization."</p>

<p>"Space Cadets?" Connel looked at the planter quizzically.</p>

<p>"Yes, nice young chaps. Corbett, Manning, and a big
fellow named Astro. They're out in the jungle now hunting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>for tyrannosaurus. I met them through a friend in
Venusport and invited them to use my house as a base
of operations. Do you know them?"</p>

<p>Connel nodded. "Very well. Finest cadet unit at the
Academy. How long have they been in the jungle?"</p>

<p>"About four and a half days now."</p>

<p>"Hope they get themselves a tyranno. But at the
same time"&mdash;Connel couldn't help chuckling&mdash;"if they
do, Space Academy will never hear the end of it!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the hot wilting silence around the house
was shattered by a thunderous roar. Connel jumped up,
followed Sinclair to the window, and stared out over
the clearing. They saw what appeared to be a well-organized
squadron of jet boats come in for a landing
with near military precision. The doors opened quickly
and men poured out onto the dusty field. They were
dressed alike in coveralls with short quarter-length
space boots and round plastic crash helmets. Each man
carried a paralo-ray gun strapped to his hips. The uniforms
were a brilliant green, with a white band across
the chest. The men formed ranks, waited for a command
from a man dressed in darker green, and then
marched up toward the house.</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" roared Connel. "Who are
they?"</p>

<p>"The Nationalists!" cried Sinclair. "They threatened
to burn down my house and destroy my farm if I wrote
that letter to the delegate. They've come to carry out
their threat!"</p>

<p>Connel pulled the paralo-ray gun from his hip and
gripped it firmly. "Do you want those men in your
house?" he asked Sinclair.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, of course not!"</p>

<p>"Then you have Solar Guard protection."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>"How&mdash;?" Sinclair asked. "There are no Solar Guardsmen
around here!"</p>

<p>"What in blazes do you think I am, man!" roared
Connel as he lunged for the door and stepped out onto
the porch. The men were within a hundred feet of the
porch when they saw Connel. The Solar Guard officer
spread his legs and stuck out his jaw, his paralo-ray gun
leveled. "The first one of you tin soldiers that puts a
foot on these steps gets frozen stiffer than a snowball
on Pluto! Now stand where you are, state your business,
and then <i>blast off</i>!"</p>

<p>"Halt!" The leader of the column of men held up his
hand. Connel saw that the plastic helmets were frosted
over, except for a clear band across the eye level. All of
the faces were hidden. The leader stepped forward, his
hand on his paralo-ray gun. "Greetings, Major Connel."</p>

<p>Connel snorted. "If you'd take off that Halloween
mask, I might know who I'm talking to!"</p>

<p>"My name is Hilmarc."</p>

<p>"Hilmarc?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am the leader of this detachment."</p>

<p>"Leader, huh?" grunted Connel. "Leader of what? A
bunch of little tin soldiers?"</p>

<p>"You shall see, Major." Hilmarc's voice was low and
threatening.</p>

<p>"I'm going to count to five," announced Connel
grimly, lifting his paralo-ray gun, "and if you and your
playmates aren't back in your ships, I start blasting."</p>

<p>"That would be unwise," replied Hilmarc. "Your one
gun against all of ours."</p>

<p>Connel grinned. "I know. It's going to be a whale of
a fight, isn't it?" Then, without pause, he shouted, "<i>One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five!</i>"</p>

<p>He opened fire, squeezing the trigger rapidly. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>first row of green-clad men were immediately frozen.
Dropping to one knee, the spaceman again opened fire,
and men in the second row stiffened as they tried to return
the fire.</p>

<p>"Fire! Cut him down!" roared Hilmarc frantically.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-084.png" width="500" height="430" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The men broke ranks and the area in front of Sinclair's
house crackled with paralo-ray gunfire. Darting
behind a chair, Connel dropped to the floor, his gun
growing hot under the continuous discharge of paralyzing
energy. In a matter of moments the Solar Guard
officer had frozen nearly half of the attacking troop,
their bodies scattered in various positions. Suddenly his
gun spit fire and began to smoke. The energy charge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>was exhausted. Connel jumped to his feet and snapped
to attention. He knew from experience that if being hit
was inevitable, the best way to receive the charge was
by standing at attention, taking the strain off the heart.
He faced the clearing and a dozen shots of paralyzing
energy hit him simultaneously. He became rigid and
the short furious battle was over.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-085.png" width="500" height="430" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>One of the green-clad men released Hilmarc from
the effects of Connel's ninth shot and he stepped forward
to stare straight into Connel's eyes. "I know you
can hear me, Major. I want to compliment you on your
shooting. But your brave resistance now is as futile as
the resistance of the entire Solar Guard in the near future."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Hilmarc smiled arrogantly and stepped back.
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I will attend to the business
I came here for&mdash;to take care of a weakling and an informer!"
He turned and shouted to his men. "You have
your orders! Get Sinclair and then burn everything in
sight."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Astro, Tom," gasped Roger. "I&mdash;I can't go on."</p>

<p>The blond-haired cadet fell headlong to the ground,
almost burying himself in the mud. Tom and Astro
turned without a word, and gripping Roger under each
arm, helped him to his feet. Behind them, the thunder
of the stalking tyrannosaurus came closer, and they
forced themselves to greater effort. For two days they
had been running before the monster. It was a wild
flight through a wild jungle that offered them little protection.
And while their fears were centered on the
brute behind them, their sleepy, weary eyes sought out
other dangers that lay ahead. More than once they
stopped to blast a hungry, frightened beast that barred
their path, leaving it for the tyrannosaurus and giving
themselves a momentary respite in their flight.</p>

<p>Astro led the way, tirelessly slashing at the vines and
creepers with his jungle knife, opening the path for
Roger and Tom. The Venusian cadet was sure that they
were near the clearing around the Sinclair plantation.
Since early morning he had seen the trail markers they
had left when they started into the jungle. The cadets
knew that if they didn't reach the clearing soon they
would have to stand and fight the terrible thing that
trailed them. During the first wild night, they had
stumbled into a sinkhole, and as Tom wallowed helplessly
in the clinging, suffocating mud, Astro and Roger
stood and fought the giant beast. The shock rifles
cracked against the armorlike hide of the monster, momentarily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>stunning him, but in the darkness and rain,
they were unable to get a clear head shot. When Tom
finally pulled himself out of the mudhole, they struggled
onward through the jungle, with only one shot left
in each blaster.</p>

<p>"How much farther, Astro?" asked Tom, his voice
weak with fatigue. "I'm starting to fold too."</p>

<p>"Not too far now, Tom," the big cadet assured him.
"We should be hitting the clearing soon now." He
turned and looked back. "If we could only get a clear
shot at that brute's head!"</p>

<p>"Hang on, Roger," said Tom. "Just a little more now."</p>

<p>Roger didn't answer, merely bobbing his head in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Behind them, the crashing thunderous steps seemed
to be getting closer and Astro drove himself harder,
slashing at the vines and tangled underbrush, sometimes
just bursting through by sheer driving strength.
But the heavy-footed creature still stalked them ponderously.</p>

<p>Suddenly Astro stopped and sniffed the air. "Smoke!"
he cried. "We're almost there!"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger smiled wanly and they pushed on. A
moment later the giant cadet pointed through the underbrush.
"There! I see the clearing! And&mdash;by the stars&mdash;there's
a fire! The house is burning!"</p>

<p>Forgetting the danger behind them, the three boys
raced toward the clearing. Just before they emerged
from the jungle, they stopped and stood openmouthed
with astonishment, staring at the scene before them.</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" gasped Astro. "Look!"</p>

<p>The outbuildings of the plantation were burning furiously,
sending up thick columns of smoke. The wind
blew the dense fumes toward them and they began to
cough and gag. Through the smoke they saw a strange
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>array of jet craft in the clearing. Then suddenly their
attention was jerked back to another danger. The tyrannosaurus
was nearly upon them.</p>

<p>"Run!" roared Astro. He broke for the clearing, followed
by Roger and Tom. Once in the open, the boys
ran several hundred yards to the nearest jet craft, and
safely in the hatch, turned to see the monster come to
the edge of the clearing and stop. They saw the brute
clearly for the first time.</p>

<p>It stood up on its hind legs, standing almost a hundred
feet high. It moved its flat, triangular-shaped head
in a slow arc, peering out over the clearing. The smoke
billowed around it. It snorted several times in fear and
anger. Astro looked at it, wide-eyed, and finally spoke
in awed tones. "By the rings of Saturn, it is!"</p>

<p>"Is what?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"The same tyranno I blasted when I was a kid, the
one that trapped me in the cave!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" snorted Roger. "How can you tell?"</p>

<p>"There on the head, the scars&mdash;and that eye. That's
the mark of a blaster!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be a rocket-headed Earthworm!" said Tom.</p>

<p>The smoke thickened at the moment, and when it
cleared again, the great beast was gone. "I guess the
smoke chased him away," said Astro. "Smoke!" He
whirled around. With the threat of the tyrannosaurus
gone, they could face the strange happenings around
the clearing.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Tom. He started for the burning
buildings in back of the house.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a group of the green-clad men
came around the side of the house. Astro grabbed Tom
by the arm and pulled him back.</p>

<p>"What's going on here? All these ships, buildings
burning, and those men dressed in green. What is it?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>The three boys huddled behind the jet and studied
the scene.</p>

<p>"I don't get it," said Tom. "Who are those men? They
almost look as if they're soldiers of some kind, but I
don't recognize the uniform."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's the fire department," suggested Roger.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" roared Tom suddenly. "There on
the porch! Major Connel!"</p>

<p>"Omigosh!" said Astro. "It is, but what's the matter
with him? Why is he standing there like that?"</p>

<p>"He's been paralo-rayed!" exclaimed Roger. "See how
still he is! Whatever these jokers in uniforms are, they're
not friendly!" He raised his shock rifle. "This last shot
in my blaster should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Roger," said Tom, "don't go off half-cocked.
We can't do much with just three shots. We'd
better take over one of these ships. There must be guns
aboard."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Astro. "How about that big one over
there?" He pointed to the largest of the assembled
crafts.</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Tom. "Sneak around this side and make
a dash for it."</p>

<p>Gripping their rifles, they slipped around the stern
of the small ship, and keeping a wary eye on the milling
men around the front of the building, they dashed toward
the bigger ship.</p>

<p>On the porch of the main house, Major Connel, every
muscle in his body paralyzed, saw the three cadets dart
across the field and his heart skipped a beat. Immediately
before him, two of the green-clad men were holding
Sinclair while Hilmarc addressed him arrogantly.</p>

<p>"This is just the beginning, Sinclair. Don't try to cross
us again. Neither you nor anyone else can stop us!" He
whirled around and faced Connel. "And as for you and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>your Solar Guard, Major Connel, you can tell them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hilmarc's tirade was suddenly interrupted by a shrill
whistle and the glare of a red flare overhead. There was
a chorus of shouts as the men ducked for cover.</p>

<p>A voice, Connel recognized as Tom's, boomed out
over the loud-speaker of the large jet ship near the edge
of the clearing. "Now hear this! You are covered by an
atomic mortar. Drop your guns and raise your hands!"</p>

<p>The men stared at the ship, confused, but Hilmarc
issued a curt command. "Return to the ships!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but he'll blast us," whined one of the men.
"He'll kill us all."</p>

<p>"You fool!" roared Hilmarc. "It must be a friend of
Connel's or Sinclair's. He won't dare fire an atomic shell
near this house, for fear of killing his friends! Now get
aboard your ships and blast off!"</p>

<p>From their ship, Tom, Roger, and Astro saw the men
scatter across the field, and realizing their bluff had
failed, they opened fire with the paralo-ray guns. But
their range was too far. In a few moments the clearing
around the Sinclair home was alive with the coughing
roar of the jets blasting off.</p>

<p>As soon as they were alone, Sinclair snatched up an
abandoned ray gun and released the major from the
charge. Connel immediately jumped for another gun.
But then, as the jets started to take off, he saw that it
would be useless to pursue the invaders. Thankful
that the cadets had arrived in time, he trotted across
the clearing to meet them as they climbed wearily from
the remaining jet ship.</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna," he roared good-naturedly,
"you three space-brained idiots had me scared! I
thought you would really let go with that mortar!"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger grinned, relieved to find the spaceman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>unhurt, while Astro looked off at the disappearing
fleet of ships.</p>

<p>"What's happened, sir?" asked Tom. "What's it all
about?"</p>

<p>"Haven't time to explain now," said Connel. "I just
want you three to know you got back here in time to
save the rest of this man's property." He turned toward
Sinclair, who was just approaching. "Did you recognize
any of them?" he asked the planter.</p>

<p>Sinclair shook his head. "I thought I did&mdash;by their
voices, I mean. But I couldn't see anyone through that
frosted headgear they were wearing."</p>

<p>"Well, they left a ship. We'll find out who that belongs
to," said Connel. "All right, Corbett, Manning,
Astro. Stand by to blast off!"</p>

<p>"Blast off?" exclaimed Roger. "But we're on leave,
sir!"</p>

<p>"Not any more, you're not!" snapped Connel. "You're
recalled as of now! Get this ship ready to blast off for
Venusport in five minutes!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_8" id="CHAPTER_8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>


<p>"Are you sure they went south, Astro?"</p>

<p>Major Connel was examining a map of the Southern
Hemisphere of Venus. The three cadets were grouped
around him in the small control room of the jet ship.</p>

<p>"I think so, sir," replied Astro. "I watched them circle
and then climb. There would be no reason to climb
unless they were going over the mountains."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Tom?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. The map doesn't show anything
but jungle for about a thousand square miles. Unless
there's a secret base somewhere between here and
there"&mdash;he placed his fingers on the map where the
Sharkey and Sinclair plantations were marked&mdash;"I don't
see where they could have gone."</p>

<p>"Well, that must be the answer, then," sighed the
gruff spaceman. "Our alert to the patrol ships in this
area narrows it down. Nothing was spotted in the air.
And they couldn't have blasted off into space. All their
ships were low-flying stuff."</p>

<p>Blasting off from the Sinclair plantation immediately,
the three cadets and the major had hoped to find the
operations base of the green-clad invaders, but the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>ships had disappeared. The ship they had captured
proved to be a freighter with no name and all identifying
marks removed. They had asked the Solar Guard
ship registry in Venusport to check on the vessel's title
but so far had received no answer.</p>

<p>Now blasting back to Venusport at full speed, Connel
told the boys the real nature of his mission to Venus.
The boys were shocked, unable to believe that anyone,
or any group of persons, would dare to buck the authority
of the Solar Guard. Yet they had seen with their
own eyes a demonstration of the strength of the Nationalists.
Roger had sent a top-secret teleceiver message to
Commander Walters at Space Academy, requesting an
immediate conference with Connel, and had received
confirmation within a half-hour.</p>

<p>"I think Captain Strong will be along too," said Roger
to Tom after Connel had retired to a compartment with
a recorder to transcribe a report of the affair at Sinclair's.
"The message said we were to prepare a full
report for consideration by Commander Walters, Professor
Sykes, and Captain Strong."</p>

<p>"Boy," said the curly-haired cadet, "this thing is too
big for me to swallow. Imagine a bunch of dopes dressing
up in uniforms and burning a guy's buildings because
he wrote a letter to his delegate!"</p>

<p>"I'd hate to be a member of that organization when
Commander Walters gets through with them," said
Roger in a slow drawl. "And particularly the guy that
ordered Connel blasted with that ray gun. Ten shots at
once! Wow! That guy must have nerves made of steel!"</p>

<p>Within an hour the jet freighter was circling Venusport
and was given priority clearance for an immediate
landing. Immediately upon landing, the ship swarmed
with Solar Guardsmen, grim-faced men assigned to
guard it, while technicians checked the ship for identification.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>The three boys were still wearing the jungle
garb when they presented themselves to Major Connel
with the request for a little sleep.</p>

<p>"Take an aspirin!" roared Connel. "We've got important
work to do!"</p>

<p>"But, sir," said Roger, his eyes half-closed, "we're
dead on our feet! We've been out in the jungle for three
days and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Manning," interrupted the spaceman, "everything
you saw during that business back at Sinclair's might be
valuable. I'm sorry, but I'll have to insist that you talk
to the Solar Guard security officers first. As tired as you
are, you might forget something after a heavy sleep."</p>

<p>There was little else the boys could do but follow the
burly officer out of the ship to a well-guarded jet cab
which took them through the streets of Venusport to
the Solar Guard headquarters.</p>

<p>They rode the elevator to the conference room in silence,
each boy feeling at any moment that he would
collapse from exhaustion. In the long corridor they
passed tough-looking enlisted guardsmen who were
heavily armed, and before being allowed into the conference
room, they were scrutinized by a burly officer.
Finally inside, they were allowed to sit down in soft
chairs and were given hot cups of tea to drink while
precise, careful interrogators took down the story of
their first meeting with the Venusian Nationalists. They
were forced to repeat details many times, in the hope
that something new might be added. Groggy after
nearly two hours of this, the boys felt sure that the time
had come for them to be allowed to get some sleep, but
after the last question from the interrogators, they were
ushered into the presence of Commander Walters, Major
Connel, Professor Sykes, Captain Strong, and several
recording secretaries. Before the conference began,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>Delegate E. Philips James arrived with his personal secretary.
He offered his excuses for being late and took his
place at the long table. Tom shot a glance at the secretary.
The man looked vaguely familiar to him. The cadet
tried to place him, but he was so tired that he
could not think.</p>

<p>"Major Connel," began Commander Walters abruptly,
"what do you consider the best possible move for the
Solar Guard to make? Under the present circumstances,
do you think we should undertake a full-scale investigation?
We talked to Al Sharkey, and while he admits
being head of an organization known as the Venusian
Nationalists, he denies any knowledge of any attack
on Sinclair such as you describe. And he claims to
have been in Venusport when the incident happened."</p>

<p>Connel thought a moment. "I don't know about
Sharkey, but I don't think a public investigation should
be made yet. I think it would arouse a lot of speculation
and achieve no results."</p>

<p>"Then you think we should move against them merely
on the basis of this encounter at the Sinclair plantation,"
asked E. Philips James in his smoothest manner.</p>

<p>Connel shook his head. "I think our best bet is to locate
their base. If we can nail them with solid evidence,
we'll have a good case to present before the Grand
Council of the Solar Alliance."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Major." James smiled. Behind him,
his secretary was busy transcribing the conversational
exchange on his audioscriber.</p>

<p>"What would you require to locate the base?" asked
Walters.</p>

<p>"I haven't worked out the details yet," said Connel,
"but a small expedition into the jungle would be better
than sending a regiment of guardsmen, or a fleet of
ships."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>"Do you have any idea where the base might be?"
Sykes suddenly spoke up. "Most of those men were supposed
to be planters who know the jungle well. Isn't it
possible that they might have their base well hidden
and a small party, such as you suggest, could cover too
little ground?"</p>

<p>Connel turned to Astro. "Astro, do you know that section
of the belt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Astro. "I hunted all over that area
when I was a boy." The big cadet went on to explain
how he had become so familiar with the jungle, and described
briefly their experience with the tyrannosaurus.
All of the men at the table were impressed by his knowledge
of jungle lore.</p>

<p>"I gather you plan to take these cadets on your expedition,
Major," commented James.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. They work well together and have already
been in the jungle," answered Connel.</p>

<p>"What do you three boys think of the idea?" asked
Walters. "I don't have to remind you that you'll be up
against two kinds of danger: the jungle itself, and the
Nationalists."</p>

<p>"We understand, sir," replied Tom, without even
waiting for his unit mates' quick nods.</p>

<p>"There's another factor," Captain Strong broke in.
"You'll be giving up your leave. There won't be any extra
time off. Should this mission be completed before
the next term at the Academy begins, fine. But if not,
you'll have to return to work immediately."</p>

<p>"We understand that too, sir," said Tom. "We're willing
to do anything we can. And if I might offer a personal
opinion"&mdash;he glanced at Astro and Roger&mdash;"I
think the <i>Polaris</i> unit appreciates the seriousness of the
situation and we agree with the major. A small party,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>especially ours, since we're already established as hunters,
would be less suspect than a larger one."</p>

<p>"I think we all agree that the <i>Polaris</i> unit is qualified
for the mission, Corbett," said Walters, who saw
through Tom's eagerness to be assigned to go with the
major.</p>

<p>The meeting broke up soon afterward. Connel remained
with Strong and Walters to work out the details
of the mission and to draft a top-secret report to the
Grand Council of the Solar Alliance.</p>

<p>The three weary cadets were quartered in the finest
hotel in Venusport and had just stumbled into bed
when the room teleceiver signal buzzed. Tom shuffled
over to the screen near the table where the remains of a
huge supper gave mute evidence of their hunger.
Switching on the machine, he saw Strong's face come
into focus.</p>

<p>"I hope you boys aren't too comfortable," announced
Strong. "I'm afraid the sleep you're so hungry for will
have to wait. This is an emergency!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" groaned Roger. "I can't understand why
emergencies come up every time I try to pound the pillow!"</p>

<p>Astro fell back onto his bed with the look of a martyred
saint and groaned.</p>

<p>"What is it, sir?" asked Tom, who was as tired as the
others. Nonetheless he felt the urgency in Strong's
voice.</p>

<p>"You blast off in half an hour," said the Solar Guard
captain. "The <i>Polaris</i> has been refitted and you're to
check her over before returning to Sinclair's. Everything
has been prepared for you. Get dressed and you'll find
a jet cab waiting for you in front of the hotel. I had
hoped to see you again before you left, but I've been ordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>back to the Academy with Commander Walters.
We've got to report to the Solar Council, personally."</p>

<p>"O.K., sir," said Tom, then smiled and added, "We're
sorry your fishing was interrupted."</p>

<p>"I wasn't catching anything, anyway." Strong
laughed. "I've got to go. See you back at the Academy.
Spaceman's luck!"</p>

<p>"Same to you, sir," replied Tom. The screen blurred
and the image faded as the connection was broken.
Tom turned to face his sleepy-eyed unit mates. "Well, I
guess we'd better take another aspirin. It looks like a
hard night!"</p>

<p>Hastily donning fresh jungle gear supplied the night
before in anticipation of the mission, the three cadets
trouped wearily out of their rooms and rode down to
the lobby in the vacuum elevator. They walked across
the deserted lobby as though in a trance and outside to
the quiet street. A jet cab stood at the curb, the driver
watching them. He whistled sharply and waved at
them. "Hey, cadets! Over here!"</p>

<p>Still in a fog, the three cadets climbed into the back
seat, flopping into the soft cushions with audible groans
as the cab shot away from the hotel and sped into the
main highway which led to the spaceport.</p>

<p>The traffic was light and the cab zoomed along at a
smooth, fast clip, lulling the boys into a fitful doze. But
they were rudely awakened when the car spun into a
small country lane and the driver slammed on the
brakes. He whirled around and grinned at them over a
paralo-ray pistol. "Sorry, boys, the ride ends here. Now
climb out and start stripping."</p>

<p>The three sleepy cadets came alive instantly. Without
a word they moved in three different directions simultaneously.
Tom dived for one door, Astro the other,
while Roger flopped to the floor. The driver fired, missing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>all of them, and before he could fire again he was
jerked out of his seat and held in a viselike grip by Astro.
Tom quickly wrenched the paralo-ray gun from his
hand.</p>

<p>"All right, you little space crawler," growled Astro,
"start talking!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-099.png" width="500" height="429" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Take it easy, Astro," said Tom. "How do you expect
him to talk when you've got him around the Adam's
apple!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, you big ape," said Roger in a slow drawl.
"Find out what he has to say before you twist his head
off!"</p>

<p>Astro released the man, pushing him against the cab
door and pinning him there.</p>

<p>"Now let's have it," he growled. "What's this all
about?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>"I didn't mean any harm," whined the cab driver. "A
guy calls me and says for me to meet three Space Cadets."</p>

<p>"What guy?" snapped Tom.</p>

<p>"A guy I once knew when I was working the fields in
the jungle belt. I worked on a plantation as a digger."</p>

<p>"What's his name?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't know his name. He's just a guy. He calls me
and says it's worth a hundred credits to pick up three
Space Cadets from the hotel and hold 'em for an hour.
I figured the best way to hold you would be to make
you take your clothes off."</p>

<p>"What did he look like?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"A little guy, with a bald head and a limp. That's all
I know&mdash;honest."</p>

<p>"A limp, eh?" asked Tom. "A little fellow?"</p>

<p>"How little?" asked Astro, getting the drift of Tom's
question.</p>

<p>"Real little. About five feet maybe, not much more'n
that!"</p>

<p>The three boys looked at each other and nodded.</p>

<p>"The guy we bought our jungle gear from in the
pawnshop!" exclaimed Astro.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Tom. "It sure sounds like him. But why
would he want to stop us? And more important, who
told him that Captain Strong was sending a cab for us?"</p>

<p>They turned back to the cab driver for further explanation,
but the man was now actually crying with fright.</p>

<p>"We won't get anything more out of this little creep,"
said Astro. "Let's just turn him over to the Solar Guard
at the spaceport. They'll know how to handle him."</p>

<p>"Right," Tom agreed. "We've lost enough time as
it is."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;please!" moaned the cabman. "Lemme go!
Take the cab. Drive it to the spaceport and just leave it,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>but please don't turn me over to the Solar Guard. If I'm
seen with them, I'll be&mdash;" Suddenly the man darted to
one side, eluded Astro's lunge, and scampered away. In
a moment he was swallowed up in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Boy," breathed Astro, "he was sure scared of something!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom. "And I'm beginning to get a little
scared myself!"</p>

<p>The cadets climbed into the cab and roared off toward
the spaceport, each boy with the feeling that he
was sitting on a smoldering volcano that was suddenly
starting to erupt around him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_9" id="CHAPTER_9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>


<p>"Rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i> to Solar Guard Venusport! Request
emergency relay circuit to Commander Walters
en route Earth!"</p>

<p>On the radar bridge of the <i>Polaris</i>, Roger Manning
spoke quickly into the teleceiver microphone. Just a few
minutes before the giant spaceship had blasted off from
Venusport, heading for the Sinclair plantation, Major
Connel had ordered Roger to get in touch with Walters
to report the latest security leak. On the control deck
the major paced back and forth restlessly as Tom guided
the <i>Polaris</i> on its short flight.</p>

<p>"I'll find the spy in the Solar Guard if I have to tear
Venusport apart piece by piece!" fumed Connel.</p>

<p>"What about that jet freighter we took away from the
Nationalists, sir?" asked Tom. "Did you ever find out
where it came from?"</p>

<p>Connel nodded. "It was an old bucket on the Southern
Colonial run. She was reported lost last year. Somehow
those jokers got hold of her and armed her to the
teeth."</p>

<p>"You think maybe the crew could have mutinied,
sir?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>"It's highly possible, Corbett," answered Connel, and
glanced around. "If they have any other ships of that
size, the <i>Polaris</i> will be able to handle them."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Tom smiled. "The repair crew did a good
job on her." The cadet paused. "Do you suppose one of
the Nationalists planted that bomb on her fin?"</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," replied Connel. "And it seems to tie
in with a rather strange thing that happened in the Venusian
Delegate's office the day before it happened."</p>

<p>"What was that, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Three priority orders for seats aboard a Venusport&mdash;Atom
City express were stolen. Before a check could be
made, the ship had made its run and the people using
the priorities were gone. They must have been the ones
that bumped you off your seats."</p>

<p>"How do you think that ties in with the bomb on the
<i>Polaris</i>, sir?"</p>

<p>"We're trying to figure that out now," said Connel.
"If only we knew what they looked like it would help.
The girl at the ticket office doesn't remember them and
neither does the ship's stewardess."</p>

<p>"But we saw them, sir!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>"You what!" roared Connel.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We were standing there at the ticket counter
when they called for their tickets."</p>

<p>"Do you think you'd recognize them again?"</p>

<p>"I'll say!" asserted Tom. "And I'm sure Astro and
Roger would, too. We were so mad, we could have
blasted them on the spot."</p>

<p>Connel turned to the intercom and shouted, "Manning,
haven't you got that circuit through yet?"</p>

<p>"Working on it, sir." Roger's voice was smooth and
unruffled over the intercom. "I'm in contact with the
commander's ship now. They're calling him to the radar
bridge now."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom suddenly jumped out of his seat as though stung.
"Say! I saw one of the fellows again too!"</p>

<p>Connel whirled quickly to face the young cadet.
"Where?" he demanded. "Where did you see him?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm trying to remember." Tom began pacing the
deck, snapping his fingers impatiently. "It was sometime
during the past few days&mdash;I know it was!"</p>

<p>"In Venusport?" demanded Connel, following Tom
around the deck.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before or after your trip into the jungle?"</p>

<p>"Uhh&mdash;before, I think," Tom replied hesitantly. "No.
No. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'it'.">It</ins> was after we came back."</p>

<p>"Well, out with it, Corbett!" exploded the major.
"When? Where? You didn't do that much visiting! You
were too tired to move!"</p>

<p>"That's just it, sir," said Tom, shaking his head. "I
was so tired everything was a blur. Faces are all mixed
up. I&mdash;I&mdash;" The boy stopped and put his hands to his
head as though trying to squeeze the one vital face out
of his hazy memory.</p>

<p>Connel kept after him like a hungry, stalking animal.
"Where, Corbett? When?" he shouted. "You've got to
remember. This is important! Think, blast you!"</p>

<p>"I'm trying, sir," replied the cadet. "But it just won't
come to me."</p>

<p>The buzz of the intercom suddenly sounded and
Connel reluctantly left Tom to answer it. Roger's voice
crackled over the speaker. "I have Commander Walters
now, sir. Feeding him down to the control-deck teleceiver."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," replied Connel and turned to Tom.
"Come on, Corbett. I want you to report to the commander
personally."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom, walking slowly to the teleceiver.
"I'm sorry I can't remember where I saw that
man."</p>

<p>"Forget it," Connel said gruffly. "It'll come to you
again sometime." He paused and then added as gently
as he could, "Sorry I blasted you like that."</p>

<p>When Commander Walters' face appeared on the
teleceiver screen, Connel reported the incident of the
cab driver and the news that Tom, Roger, and Astro
had seen the three men who had taken the priorities on
the <i>Venus Lark</i>.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," said Walters. "I'll have a recorder
take down the descriptions."</p>

<p>Connel motioned to Tom, who stepped before the
screen. When he saw Walters nod, he gave a complete
description of the three men he had seen in the Atom
City spaceport.</p>

<p>"Let's see, now," said Walters, after Tom had concluded
his report. "The man who asked for the tickets
was young, about twenty-two, dressed in Venusian
clothing, dark, six feet tall, weighed about one hundred
and fifty pounds. Right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom.</p>

<p>Connel suddenly stepped before the screen to interject,
"And Corbett saw him in Venusport again sometime
during the last two days."</p>

<p>"Really? Where?"</p>

<p>Connel glanced at Tom and then replied hurriedly,
"Well, he can't be sure, sir. We rushed him around
pretty fast and he saw a lot of people. But at least we
know he's in Venusport somewhere."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Walters. "That's something to work
on, at least. And you have nothing more to add to the
descriptions of the other two, Corbett?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not anything particular, sir," said Tom. "They were
dressed in Venusian-type clothes also, but we didn't get
a close look at them."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Walters. "Proceed with your mission,
Major. I'll have an alert sent out for the cab driver,
and I'll have the owner of the pawnshop picked up.
There must be someone on the Solar Delegate's staff
who stole those priorities. We'll start searching there
first, and if we come up with anyone who can't explain
his absence from Venusport at the time the priorities
were used, and fits Corbett's description, we'll contact
you. End transmission!"</p>

<p>"End transmission!" repeated Connel. The screen
blanked out and Roger's voice came over the intercom
immediately. "We'll be over Sinclair's in three minutes,"
he called. "Stand by."</p>

<p>Tom turned to the controls and in exactly two minutes
and fifty seconds the clearing surrounding Sinclair's
home and the burned outbuildings came into
view. Working effortlessly, with almost casual teamwork,
the three cadets brought the giant spaceship to
rest in the middle of the clearing. As the power was cut,
the cadets saw George and Mrs. Hill jumping into a jet
car and speeding out to greet them.</p>

<p>After Tom introduced Connel to the couple, the major
questioned them closely about their absence during
the attack by the shock troops.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sinclair often gives us time off for a trip into
Venusport," explained Hill. "It <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'get's'.">gets</ins> pretty lonely out
here."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Sinclair in now?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"No, he isn't," replied the plantation foreman. "He's
on his weekly trip around the outer fields. I don't expect
him back for another day or two."</p>

<p>"For goodness sakes," exclaimed Mrs. Hill, "you can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ask your questions just as easily and a darn sight more
comfortably in the house! Come on. Let's get out of the
sun."</p>

<p>The small group climbed into the jet car and roared
off across the clearing toward the house. The lone building
left standing by the Nationalists looked strange
amid the charred ruins of the other buildings. In the
house, the three cadets busied themselves with home-baked
apple pie which the housekeeper had brought
out, while Connel was telling George of the attack on
the plantation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p>"I've known about them all along, of course," said the
foreman. "But I never paid any attention to them. I just
quit, like Mr. Sinclair, when they started all that tomfoolery
about wearing uniforms and stuff."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well," said Connel, accepting a wedge of pie at Mrs.
Hill's insistence, "now they've made the wrong move.
Burning Sinclair's property and attacking an officer of
the Solar Guard is going too far."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" asked George.</p>

<p>"I'm not at liberty to say, Mr. Hill," replied Connel.
"But I can tell you this. When any person, or group of
persons, tries to dictate to the Alliance, the Solar Guard
steps in and puts a stop to it!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence of the jungle clearing was shattered
by the roar of a single jet craft coming in for a
landing. Without looking out the window, George
smiled and said, "There's Mr. Sinclair now! I know the
sound of his jets."</p>

<p>The group crowded out onto the front porch while
George took the jet car and drove off to pick up his employer.
A few moments later Sinclair was seated before
Connel, wiping his sweating brow and accepting a cool
drink from Mrs. Hill.</p>

<p>"I was on my way to the north boundary when I saw
your ship landing," explained Sinclair. "At first I
thought it might be those devils coming back, but then
I saw the Solar Guard insigne on the ship and figured
it might be you." He looked at Connel closely. "Anything
new, Major?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Connel. "But you can rest assured
that you won't be bothered by them again."</p>

<p>Sinclair paused, eying the major speculatively. "You
know, as soon as you left, I went over to talk to Al
Sharkey. I was plenty mad and really blasted him, but
he swears that he was in Venusport at the time and
doesn't know a thing about the raid."</p>

<p>Connel nodded. "That's true. We checked on him.
But while he might not have been in on the raid itself,
there's nothing that says he didn't order it done!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>"I doubt it," said Sinclair, with a queer apologetic
note in his voice. "I'm inclined to believe that it was
nothing more than a bunch of the younger, more hotheaded
kids in the organization. As a matter of fact,
Sharkey told me he was quitting as president. Seems
you fellows in Venusport scared him plenty. Not only
that, but I heard him calling up the other planters telling
them what happened and every one of them is chipping
in to rebuild my plantation."</p>

<p>Connel looked at the planter steely-eyed. "So you
think it was done by a bunch of kids, huh?"</p>

<p>Sinclair nodded. "Wouldn't be surprised if they're
not scared too!"</p>

<p>"Well, you are entitled to your opinion, Mr. Sinclair.
And if the other planters are going to rebuild your
buildings, that's fine and charitable of them." Suddenly
Connel's voice became harsh. "That does not, however,
erase the fact that a group of uniformed men, armed
with paralo-ray guns and with ships equipped with
blasters, attacked you! Atomic blasters, Mr. Sinclair,
are not bought at the local credit exchange. They are
made exclusively for the Solar Guard! That bunch of
hotheaded kids, as you call them, are capable of attacking
any community&mdash;even ships of the Solar Guard itself!
That is a threat to the peace of the solar system
and must be stopped!"</p>

<p>Sinclair nodded quickly. "Oh, I agree, Major, I agree.
I'm just saying that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Connel stopped him. "I understand, Mr. Sinclair.
You're a peaceful man and want to keep your life peaceful.
But my job is to ensure that peace. As long as a
group of militant toughs like we had here are on the
loose, you won't have peace. You'll have pieces!"</p>

<p>Tom, Roger, and Astro, sitting quietly and listening,
felt like standing up and cheering as the major finished.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>"I know you can't tell me what you're going to do,
Major Connel," said the planter, "but I hope that you'll
allow me to help in any way I can."</p>

<p>Connel hesitated before answering. "Thank you, Mr.
Sinclair. But I'm not here officially now." And then he
added, "Nor in regard to the Nationalists."</p>

<p>Sinclair's eyes lit up slightly. "Oh?"</p>

<p>"No. As you know, the cadets had quite a time with a
tyrannosaurus. They wounded it and it might still be
dangerous. That is, more dangerous than normally. I've
got orders to track him down and finish him off."</p>

<p>"But I thought you said you were going to put a stop
to this business with the Nationalists," said the planter.</p>

<p>"I said the Solar Guard would, Sinclair."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," mumbled Sinclair, "the Solar Guard. Of
course."</p>

<p>Connel got up abruptly. "I would appreciate it if you
would look after our ship, though," he said. "I don't
think we'll be longer than a week. Shouldn't be hard to
track a tyrannosaurus, especially if it's wounded."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have all the equipment you need,"
said Sinclair.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," replied Connel. Then, thanking
Mrs. Hill for the refreshments, the burly spaceman and
the three cadets said good-by and left the house.</p>

<p>An hour later, ready to strike off into the jungle, the
Solar Guard officer took four of the latest model shock
rifles out of the arms locker of the <i>Polaris</i> and gave one
to each boy with extra ammunition. "Never go after a
giant with a popgun," he said. "It's a wonder you didn't
kill yourselves with those old blasters you used, let
alone kill a tyranno."</p>

<p>The three cadets examined the rifles closely and with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"These are the latest Solar Guard issue," said Connel.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>"When you pull that trigger, you release a force three
times greater than anything put into a rifle before."</p>

<p>Then, checking the <i>Polaris</i> and cutting all power,
Connel removed the master switch and hid it. "That's
so no one will get any bright ideas while we're gone,"
he explained as the boys watched curiously.</p>

<p>"You think someone might try to steal her, sir?" asked
Tom.</p>

<p>"You never can tell, Corbett," answered Connel noncommittally.</p>

<p>Once again the three boys moved across the clearing
toward the jungle wall. Astro took the lead as before,
followed by Roger and Tom, and Connel brought up
the rear. They moved directly to the spot where they
had last seen the tyrannosaurus, found the trampled
underbrush and massive tracks, and moved purposefully
into the dank, suffocating green world.</p>

<p>The trail was plain to see. Where the boys once had
to hack their way through the thick underbrush, the
monster had created a path for them. The three cadets
felt better about being back in the jungle with more reliable
equipment and joked about what they would do
to the tyrannosaurus when they saw it again.</p>

<p>"I thought you were supposed to be the home-grown
Venusian hick that could manage in the jungle like that
fairy-tale character, Tarzan," Roger teased Astro.</p>

<p>"Listen, you sleepwalking space Romeo," growled
Astro, "I know more about this jungle than you could
learn in ten years. And I'm not foolish enough to battle
with a tyranno with the odds on his side. I ran for a
good reason!"</p>

<p>"Boy, did you run!" taunted Roger. "You were as fast
as the <i>Polaris</i> on emergency thrust!"</p>

<p>"Knock off that rocket wash!" roared Connel. "The
Nationalists might have security patrols in this area.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>They could hear you talking and blast you before you
could bat an eyelash! Now keep quiet and stay alert!"</p>

<p>The three cadets quieted down after that, walking
carefully, stepping around dead brush that might betray
their presence. After working their way along the
tyrannosaurus's trail for several hours, Connel called a
halt, and after a quick look at his compass, motioned for
them to cut away from the monster's tracks.</p>

<p>"We'll start working around in a circle," he said. "One
day east, one south, west, and north. Then we'll move
in closer to the heart of the circle, and repeat the same
procedure. That should cover a lot of ground in eight
days. If anything's moving around out here, besides
what should be here, we'll find it. From now on, we'll
have a scout. Astro, you know the jungle, you take the
point, about five hundred yards ahead. If you see anything,
signs of a patrol or any danger from the jungle,
fall back and report. Don't try to do anything yourself.
Four guns in a good position are better than one popping
off by itself."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," said Astro. With a quick nod to Tom
and Roger, he moved off through the jungle. In ten feet
he was invisible. In thirty seconds his footsteps were
lost in the thousands of jungle sounds around them.</p>

<p>"I'll take the lead now," said Connel. "Corbett, you
bring up the rear. All right, move out!"</p>

<p>From above, in the leafy roof covering the jungle;
from the side, in the thick tangle of vines; and from below,
in the thorny underbrush, the eyes of living things,
jungle things, followed the movements of the three
spacemen, perhaps wondering if these new beasts were
a threat to their lives.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_10" id="CHAPTER_10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>


<p>"Hal-loo-ooo!"</p>

<p>Astro's voice boomed out over the tops of the trees,
where the birds fluttered in sudden fright. It echoed
through the darkness around him, where smaller creatures
crawled and slithered into the protection of their
holes. The voice of the big cadet was loud, but it was
not loud enough for his mates to hear.</p>

<p>Astro was lost.</p>

<p>He couldn't understand how it had happened. Over
and over during the past six hours he had retraced his
steps mentally, trying to visualize the trail, trying to locate
the telltale marks he had made with his jungle
knife, and so find Major Connel, Tom, and Roger. It
was dark now and the big cadet had to face the dangerous
jungle alone. He laughed ironically. Connel had
given him the point because he knew the jungle! And
now he was lost.</p>

<p>Astro was a little frightened too. It was his frank realization
of trouble that made him afraid. He knew what
was in the jungle, and though he had been there alone
before, he had never been in it as deeply as this, nor
had he ever been lost in the nightmarish place after
sundown.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<p>While he was desperately anxious to find his unit
mates, he had not fired his rifle. The threat of exposing
his position to a possible Nationalist patrol prevented
him from signaling with the blaster or even from building
a fire. During the last hours of the day, when the
suspicion that he was lost became a concrete fact, the
big cadet had been reluctant even to yell. Now, with
pitch-black night closing around him, he dared to call,
hoping it would be heard and recognized by his friends,
or if not, considered the howl of a jungle beast by an
enemy patrol should one be near.</p>

<p>He stood with his back against the rough bark of a
teakwood tree to protect his rear and to face out toward
the pitch-black night. More than once the big cadet felt
the sudden ripple of a crawling thing moving around
him, across his toes or down the tree trunk. There was a
sudden thrashing in the underbrush near by and he
brought the shock rifle up quickly, ears tuned for the
growl, or scream, or hiss of an attacking beast.</p>

<p>The luminous dial of his watch showed it to be three
thirty in the morning, two and a half hours to go before
the sun would drive the fearful darkness away. He had
been calling every five minutes. And every time he
shouted, the movements in the darkness around him increased.</p>

<p>"Hal-loo-ooo!"</p>

<p>He waited, turning his head from one side to the
other, intent on the sounds that came from a distance;
the answering call of the waddling ground bird that
had confused him at first until he recognized it; the
shrill scream of the tiny swamp hog; the distant chattering
of the monkeylike creatures in the treetops. But
there was no sound from a human throat.</p>

<p>Astro called again and again. The seconds dragged
by into minutes, the minutes into an hour, and then two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>hours, and finally, as every muscle in his body ached
from standing backed up to the tree all night and holding
his rifle on alert, the gray murky dawn broke over
the jungle and he began to see the green of the jungle
around him. When the sun at last broke over the Venusian
horizon, the night's frost on the leaves and bushes
danced and glittered like jewels.</p>

<p>He washed his face in a near-by pool, careful not to
drink any of the water. He opened a can of synthetic
food, and after eating his fill, cleared away the brush
down to the naked black soil and banking it high on all
sides he stretched full length on the ground. He dared
not sleep. Hungry animals were moving about freely
now. A paralo-ray gun and the rifle, both cocked and
ready to fire, were held in his hands. He relaxed as completely
as he could, idly watching the mother of a brood
of the anthropoids scamper through the branches of
the trees overhead, bringing her squalling young their
breakfast. An hour later, refreshed, he started through
the jungle again, eyes open for signs of recent activity,
human activity, for the big cadet wanted to return to
his comrades.</p>

<p>Stopping occasionally to climb a tree, Astro searched
the sky above the treetops for smoke that would mark a
campsite. He felt that sure if there was any, he would
find Roger, Tom, and Connel, since a Nationalist patrol
wouldn't advertise its presence in the jungle. But there
were no smoke signs. The top of the jungle stretched
green and still as far as he could see, steaming under
the burning rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Astro knew that it would be impossible to spend another
night like the first in the jungle, so after searching
through the forest until three in the afternoon, he
stopped, opened another can of synthetic food, and ate.
He was used to being alone now. The first wave of fear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>had left him and he was beginning to remember things
he knew as a young boy; jungle signs that warned him
of dangers, the quick identification of the animal cries,
and the knowledge of the habits of the jungle creatures.</p>

<p>After eating, he took his jungle knife and hacked at a
long, tough vine, yanking it down from its lofty tangle.
He started weaving it into a tight oblong basket and
two hours later, just before the sun dropped into the
jungle for the night, he was finished. He had a seven-foot
bag woven tightly and pulled together with a small
opening at one end. Just before the sky darkened, the
big cadet crawled into this makeshift sleeping bag,
pulled the opening closed with a tight draw cord, and
in thirty seconds was asleep. Nothing would be able to
bite through the tough vine matting, and the chances of
a larger beast accidentally stepping on him were small.
Nevertheless, Astro had pulled the bag close to a huge
tree and placed it deep between the swollen roots.</p>

<p>He awoke with a start. The ground was shaking violently.
He was sweating profusely and judged that it
must be late in the morning with the sun beating directly
on him. Carefully he opened the end of the makeshift
sleeping bag and peered out. He gasped and
reached for his shock rifle, bringing it up into firing position.
The sight that confronted him was at once horrifying
and fascinating. A hundred yards away, a giant
snake, easily a hundred feet long and five feet thick,
was wrapped around a raging tyrannosaurus. The monsters
were in a fight to death. Astro shuddered and
pulled back into the bag, keeping the blaster aimed at
the two struggling beasts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/ill-117.png" width="307" height="500" alt="Astro kept his blaster aimed at the monsters" title="" />
<span class="caption">Astro kept his blaster aimed at the monsters</span>
</div>

<p>The big cadet deduced that the snake must have
been surprised in its feeding by the tyrannosaurus, and
was trying to defend itself. There wasn't a living thing
in the jungle that would deliberately attack a tyrannosaurus.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Only man, with his intelligence and deadly
weapons, could win over the brute force and cunning of
the jungle giant. And even that had failed with this
monster. Astro quickly saw it was the same beast that
had chased the three cadets out of the jungle!</p>

<p>With three coils wrapped around the tyrannosaurus's
body, the snake was trying to wrap a fourth around its
neck and strangle it, but the monster was too wily.
Rearing back, it suddenly fell to the ground, its weight
crushing the three coils around its middle. The snake
jerked spasmodically, stunned, as the tyrannosaurus
scrambled up again. The ground trembled and branches
were ripped from near-by trees. All around the jungle
had been leveled. Everything fell before the thrashing
monsters.</p>

<p>Recovering, the snake's head darted in again, trying
to circle the tyrannosaurus's head and complete the last
and fatal coil, but the giant beast lunged, its massive
jaws snapping, and the snake drew back. Suddenly its
tail lashed out and circled the left legs of the tyrannosaurus.
Astro could see the beast straining against the
sudden pressure, at the same time alert for the swooping
head of the snake. The pressure on the leg was too
great, and the beast fell to the ground, giving the snake
a momentary advantage. Its head darted in again, but
the tyrannosaurus drew its head into its narrow shoulders,
then shot out again as the snake missed. Astro saw
the snake quiver and jerk back as the tyrannosaurus
clamped its jaws closed and bit a chunk out of the
green, scaly body.</p>

<p>The snake had enough. It wanted to get away, to slip
to the top of the tallest tree in the forest, out of reach of
the tyrannosaurus, and wait for the wound to heal or
for death to come. It unwound in a maddened convulsive
movement and slithered toward the tree where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>Astro lay. But the monster was after it, immediately
grabbing it by the tail and jerking it back. The snake
was forced to turn and fight back.</p>

<p>Astro knew that if the snake could get away it would
head for the teakwood above his head, the highest tree
around, and the tyrannosaurus would stamp the ground
around its base into powder. He had to move!</p>

<p>A hundred feet to the left was a wild thicket of
ground thorns, their needlelike tips bristling. Even the
snake would stay away from them. It was his only
chance should the snake get loose from the tyrannosaurus
again. Making up his mind quickly, the cadet
opened the end of the sleeping bag and shoved his
weapons out before him. Then hugging the ground, he
dashed across the clearing. This gave the tyrannosaurus
its final advantage. The snake pulled back, momentarily
attracted by Astro's move, and the tyrannosaurus
struck, catching the snake just behind the head in a
grip of death.</p>

<p>The thorns ripped at Astro's tight-fitting jungle dress,
tearing into his flesh as he dove into the thicket. But
once inside the cadet lay still, pointing his rifle at the
tyrannosaurus who was methodically finishing off the
giant snake. In a few seconds the snake was dead and
the tyrannosaurus began to feast.</p>

<p>Astro stayed in the thicket, watching the monster devour
nearly all of the dead reptile foe and then rise up
and move off through the jungle. Astro knew that in no
time the scavengers of the jungle would be swarming
over the remains of the snake. Once again he had to
move.</p>

<p>Getting out of the thicket was painful. From every
direction the thorns jabbed at him, and but for the
toughness of his jungle suit, Astro would have been
ripped to shreds. After easing his way back into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>clearing, the cadet pulled out the remains of his jungle
pack. He then saw that his suit was torn to ribbons, and
the many slashes on his chest and arms were bleeding
profusely. The scent of the blood would attract the carnivorous
creatures, so he stripped off the bloody jungle
suit, dropping it back in the thicket, and hurried away.
A short time later he came to a water hole where he
sponged himself off and applied medication from his
emergency kit to the scratches. Finished, he took stock.
The night's sleep had refreshed him, and except for the
loss of his protective clothing, he was in good shape. He
shouldered the pack, strapped the paralo-ray gun to his
hips, and gripping the rifle tightly, he moved off
through the jungle once more. He decided to follow the
tyrannosaurus. The beast would leave a path for him,
saving him the effort of hacking his way through the
vines and creepers, and should an enemy patrol be out,
it would stay away from the tyrannosaurus. Finally, he
knew Tom, Roger, and Connel would go after the beast
if they saw it.</p>

<p>The sun shone down on the half-naked giant moving
through the jungle, a new white-skinned animal who
was braver than the rest, a creature who dared to trail
the king of the jungle.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"It's all my fault!" said Connel disgustedly. "I should
have been able to read his trail signs."</p>

<p>Tom did not answer. He pulled the straps of his jungle
pack tighter and slung it over his shoulder. Roger
stood to one side, watching Major Connel. Both boys
sensed what was coming.</p>

<p>"Well, this is the last day we can spend searching for
him," said Connel. "We've already lost two days."</p>

<p>Roger glanced at Tom and said casually, "It wouldn't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>hurt to keep our eyes open for signs of him, would it,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Now listen, boys," said Connel firmly, "I know how
you feel about Astro. I have to admit I have a liking for
the lad myself. But we've been sent out here to locate
the base of operations of the Nationalists. The best way
to do that is to work around the jungle in a given area.
We haven't done that so far. We've put all our time and
effort into a random search for Astro. We can't signal
him, build a fire, shoot off a blaster&mdash;or use any of the
simple communication devices. We have to work under
cover, for fear of giving away our presence here in the
jungle." He slung his gear over his shoulder and added,
"We'll continue our search for Astro until noon and
then we simply will have to abandon it. And stop worrying
about him. He's a big strong lad and he's been in
this jungle alone before. I have every confidence that
he can make his way back to Sinclair's plantation
safely."</p>

<p>The Solar Guard officer paused and looked at the two
downcast cadets before him. "None of that sulking
business!" he growled. "You're cadets on an urgent mission.
Now move out. I'll take the point first and you
bring up the rear, Corbett." Without another word, the
burly spaceman turned and moved off through the jungle.</p>

<p>Roger hung back to talk to Tom. "What do you think,
Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom shook his head before answering. "He's right,
Roger. We're on a job. It's the same here in the jungle
as it is in space. We know that something is liable to
happen to any one of us at any time. And the mission
always comes first."</p>

<p>Roger nodded. "Sure, that's the way it is in the book.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>But this is real. That big hick might be hurt&mdash;or
trapped. Maybe he needs our help!"</p>

<p>"I know how you feel, Roger," replied Tom. "I want
to take off and hunt for Astro myself, but Connel needs
us. Don't forget that bunch of guys in uniforms back at
Sinclair's. Commander Walters and the others don't
hold conferences like that one back in Venusport for
the fun of it. This is serious."</p>

<p>Roger shrugged and started off after Connel, Tom
following slowly behind. Their march through the jungle
was made in silence, each hoping for a miracle. But
as the sun grew higher and the deadline hour of noon
approached, they steeled themselves to the fact that
they might never see the Venusian cadet again. A short
time later, when Tom was taking his turn at cutting the
trail through the brush, he broke through into a clearing.
He stopped and called out, "Major! Roger! Quick!"</p>

<p>Connel and the blond-haired cadet rushed forward,
stopping beside Tom to stare in amazement. Before
them, a large area of the jungle was pounded down and
lying amidst the tangle of giant creepers and uprooted
bushes was the remains of a giant snake.</p>

<p>"By the rings of Saturn!" gasped Connel, walking forward
to inspect the clearing. Tom and Roger followed,
breaking to the side, their rifles at ready. The two boys
had become jungle-wise quickly and knew that death
lurked behind the wall of green surrounding the cleared
area.</p>

<p>"It must have been some fight!" Connel pointed to
the tracks of the tyrannosaurus. "The tyranno must
have stumbled on the snake while it was feeding," said
Connel. "Otherwise it would have lit out for that tree
over there." He pointed to the giant teakwood that Astro
had slept under. The three spacemen saw the makeshift
sleeping bag at the same time.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>"Major! Look!" cried Tom and raced to the base of
the tree.</p>

<p>"It's Astro's, all right," said Connel, examining the
woven bag. "I wonder if he was here when those two
things were going after each other."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Roger in a choked whisper, "he was."
He pointed to the ragged remains of Astro's jungle suit
dangling on the near-by thornbush. The blood was stiff
on the material.</p>

<p>The three Earthmen stared at the suit, each too horrified
to speak.</p>

<p>Connel's face was set in hard lines as he finally found
his voice and growled, "Our search is over. Let's get
back to our job."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_11" id="CHAPTER_11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>


<p>It was not until late the same afternoon that Astro, following
the trail of the tyrannosaurus, realized that the
giant beast was seriously hurt. At first the traces of
blood on the ground and underbrush were slight, but
gradually the blood spots became more profuse and the
trail was covered with huge blotches of red. The Venusian
cadet grew more cautious. The tyrannosaurus
would be ten times as dangerous now. And it might be
close by, lying in the jungle, licking its wounds.</p>

<p>As the sun began to sink in the western Venusian sky,
Astro began to think about the coming night. He would
have to hole up. He couldn't chance stumbling into the
beast in the dark. But it would also mean taking time to
make another sleeping bag. Suddenly he saw a movement
in the brush to his left. He dropped to the ground
and aimed the shock rifle in that direction, eyes probing
the green tangle for further movement.</p>

<p>"Make one move and you'll die!" a harsh voice cut
through the jungle. Astro remained still, his eyes darting
to left and right, trying to locate the owner of the
voice.</p>

<p>"Throw down your gun and stand up with your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>hands over your head!" came another voice, this one
immediately behind him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">

<span class="caption">His eyes probed the jungle for further movement</span>
</div>

<p>A patrol! Astro swore at himself for blindly walking
into a trap and dropped his gun. He stood up and raised
his hands over his head, turning slowly.</p>

<p>"Don't turn around! Stand still!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>Astro stopped.</p>

<p>He could hear the rustle of movement in the underbrush
behind him and then someone called, "Circle
around to the right. Spread out and see if there are any
others!"</p>

<p>Off to the side, he could hear the crashing of footsteps
moving away in the jungle.</p>

<p>"All right," continued the unknown voice, "drop that
paralo-ray pistol to the ground. But no smart tricks. We
can see you and you can't see us, so take it easy and do
as we say."</p>

<p>Astro lowered his hands and unbuckled the gun belt,
letting it fall to the ground. There was a sudden burst
of movement behind him and powerful arms gripped
his wrists. Within seconds his hands were tied quickly
and expertly, and he was spun around to face his captors.</p>

<p>There were ten men, all dressed in the same green
uniforms and plastic headgear he had seen at the Sinclair
plantation. They stood in a semicircle around him,
their guns leveled at his naked chest. The leader of the
party nudged the nearest man and commented, "Never
thought I'd see any animal like this in the jungle!" The
other men laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" the leader demanded. "What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"My name is Astro," replied the big cadet boldly.
"I'm a Space Cadet, <i>Polaris</i> unit, Space Academy,
U.S.A. I'm here in the jungle with the rest of my unit
hunting tyrannosaurus."</p>

<p>"Tyranno, eh?" queried the man. "How long have
you been trailing this one?"</p>

<p>"Just today. I saw him fight a big snake and lost my
jungle gear in a thicket where I was hiding. I was separated
from my space buddies two days ago."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>"Say, Helia," suddenly called one of the other men,
"he sounds like a Venusian."</p>

<p>"Is that true?" asked the leader. "Are you from Venus?"</p>

<p>Astro nodded. "Venusport."</p>

<p>"Then why are you in Space Academy?"</p>

<p>"I want to be a spaceman."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go to school on Venus, instead of
Earth. We have good space schools here."</p>

<p>"I want a commission in the Solar Guard. You can
only get that through the Academy," replied Astro
stoutly.</p>

<p>"Solar Guard!" snorted the leader, and then turned to
the nearest man, speaking rapidly in a strange tongue.</p>

<p>For a moment the language confused Astro, then he
recognized it as the ancient Venusian dialect. He understood
it and started to answer, but then, on second
thought, he decided not to reveal his knowledge of the
language.</p>

<p>The leader turned back to Astro and asked a question.</p>

<p>Astro shook his head and said, "If you're talking to
me, you have to speak English. I know that's the Venusian
dialect you're speaking, but I never learned it."</p>

<p>The leader's fist shot out and crashed against Astro's
jaw. The big cadet rocked back with the punch and
then he lunged forward, straining against his bonds.</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;!" he exploded angrily.</p>

<p>"That was for not being a true Venusian!" snapped
the leader. "Every son of Venus should understand his
mother tongue!"</p>

<p>Astro bit his lip and fell silent.</p>

<p>The leader turned away, and shouting a command,
started off through the jungle. Astro knew that the patrol
had been ordered to move out, but he stood still,
waiting for them to push him. They did. A hard jab in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>his naked side with the butt of a gun sent him stumbling
forward in the center of the patrol.</p>

<p>Well, there was one consolation, he thought grimly.
At least he wouldn't have to spend the night out in the
jungle alone again!</p>

<p>Astro had expected a long march, but to his surprise,
he was pushed along a well-worn jungle trail for only
three hundred yards in from the tyrannosaurus's track.
Finally they stopped before a huge teakwood tree. The
leader pounded his rifle butt on the trunk three times.</p>

<p>Mystified, Astro watched a small section of the trunk
open to reveal a modern vacuum-tube elevator shaft.
He was pushed inside with the men of the patrol and
the tree-trunk door was closed. The leader pushed a
lever and the car dropped so suddenly that Astro nearly
lost his balance. He judged that they must have fallen
two hundred feet when the car stopped and another
door opened. He was pushed out into a high-vaulted
tunnel with cement walls.</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" snapped the leader.</p>

<p>The big cadet moved along the tunnel, followed by
the patrol, turning from one tunnel into another, all of
them slanting downhill. Astro guessed that he was being
taken to some subterranean cave. He asked his captors
where they were taking him.</p>

<p>"Don't talk!" snapped one of the men at his side.</p>

<p>"This jungle will be swarming with Solar Guardsmen
once they discover I'm lost," said Astro. "Who are you
and what are you holding me prisoner for?" The big
cadet decided it would be better to feign ignorance of
the existence of the rebel organization.</p>

<p>"Let the Solar Guard come!" snapped the leader.
"They'll find something they never expected."</p>

<p>"But what do you want with <i>me</i>?" asked the cadet.</p>

<p>"You'll know soon enough!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>They had been walking for nearly an hour and the
tunnels still slanted downward but more sharply now.
Turning into a much larger tunnel than any of the rest,
Astro noticed a huge door on one side. Through its
crystal-covered ports he saw racks of illegal heat blasters
and paralo-ray guns. A man stepped out of the door,
and raising his hand in a form of salute, called out a few
words in the Venusian tongue. Astro recognized it as a
greeting, "Long live Venusians!" and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'surpressed'.">suppressed</ins> a smile.</p>

<p>One by one, the men of the patrol handed over their
rifles and ray guns, while the man in the armory
checked off their names. Then they all removed their
knee-length jungle boots and traded their plastic helmets
for others of the same design but of a lighter material.
Each man turned his back while switching helmets,
obviously to avoid being recognized by any of the
others, since the new helmet was also frosted except for
a slit at eye level. Wearing the lighter headgear and
common street shoes, the men continued their march
through the tunnel. They passed into a still larger tunnel,
and for the first time, Astro could see daylight. As
they drew nearer to the mouth of the tunnel, the cadet
could see outside, and the scene before him made him
gasp for breath.</p>

<p>A full twenty miles long and fifteen miles wide, a
canyon stretched before him. And it seemed to the big
cadet that every square inch of the canyon floor was occupied
by buildings and spaceships. Hundreds of green-clad
men were moving around the ships and buildings.</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" gasped Astro as the patrol
paused in the mouth of the tunnel. "What&mdash;what is
this?"</p>

<p>"The first city of Venus. True Venus. Built by Venusians
with Venusian materials only!" said the leader
proudly. "There's the answer to your Solar Guard!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't understand," said Astro. "What are you going
to do?"</p>

<p>"You'll see." The man chuckled. "You'll see. Move
on!"</p>

<p>As they trooped out of the tunnel and down into the
canyon they passed groups of men working on the
many ships. The cadet recognized what they were doing
at once. The unmistakable outlines of gun ports
were being cut into the sides of several bulky space
freighters. Elsewhere, the steady pounding of metal and
grinding of machinery told the cadet that machine
shops were going at full blast. He noticed a difference
between the men of the patrol and the workers. Neither
spoke to the other. In fact, Astro saw that it was rarely
that a worker even glanced at them as they passed by.</p>

<p>Up ahead, Astro saw a huge building, wide and
sprawling but only a few stories high. It was nearly
dark now and lights began to wink on in the many windows.
He guessed that he was being taken to the building
and was not surprised when the leader pulled him
by the arm, guiding him toward a small side door.
There was a curious look about the building and the
cadet couldn't figure out what it was. Glancing quickly
at the wall as he passed through the door, he nearly
burst out laughing. The building was made of wood!
He guessed that the rebels were using materials at hand
rather than importing anything from outside planets.
And since Venus was largely a planet of jungles and
vegetation, with few large mineral deposits, wood
would be the easiest thing to use.</p>

<p>The inside of the building was handsomely decorated
and designed. He saw walls covered with carvings, depicting
old legends about the first colonists. He shook
his head. "Boy," he thought, "they sure go for the Venusian
stuff in a big way!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>"All right!" snapped the leader. "Stop here!"</p>

<p>Astro stood before a huge double door that had been
polished to a brilliant luster. The cadet waited for the
leader to enter, but the Nationalist stood perfectly still,
eyes straight ahead. Suddenly the doors swung open,
revealing a huge chamber, at least a hundred and fifty
feet long. At the far end a man dressed in white with a
green band across his chest sat in a beautifully carved
chair. Arrayed on either side of him were fifty or more
men dressed in various shades of green. The man in
white lifted his hand and the patrol leader stepped forward,
pushing Astro before him. They walked across
the polished floor and stopped ten feet away from the
man in white, the patrol leader bowing deeply. Astro
glanced at the men standing at either side of the man in
white. The bulge of paralo-ray pistols was plainly visible
beneath their flowing robes.</p>

<p>The man in white lifted his hand in the salute Astro
had seen before. Then the patrol leader straightened up
and began to speak rapidly in the Venusian dialect.
Translating easily, Astro heard him report his capture.
When he concluded, the man in white looked at Astro
closely and spoke three words. Astro shook his head.</p>

<p>"He does not speak our mother tongue, Lactu," volunteered
the patrol leader.</p>

<p>The man in white nodded. "How is it," he said in
English, "that you are a native-born Venusian and do
not speak the language of your planet?"</p>

<p>"I was an orphan. I had very little formal education,"
said Astro. "And as long as we're asking questions
around here, how about my asking a few? Who in space
are you? What's the idea of holding me a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"One question at a time, please, brother Venusian,"
said the man in white. "And when you address me, my
name is Lactu."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<p>"Lactu what?" asked Astro belligerently.</p>

<p>"Your own name should tell you that we on Venus
only have one name."</p>

<p>"Never mind that rocket wash!" barked Astro. "When
do I get out of here?"</p>

<p>"You will never leave here as you came," said Lactu
quietly.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" demanded the cadet.</p>

<p>"You have discovered the existence of our base. Ordinarily
you would have been burned to a crisp and left
in the jungle. Fortunately, you are a Venusian by birth,
and therefore have the right to join our organization."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means," said Lactu, "that you will take an oath to
fight until death if necessary to free the planet Venus
and the Venusian citizens from the slavery of the Solar
Alliance and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Awright, buster!" roared Astro. "I've had enough of
that rocket wash! I took an oath of allegiance to the
Solar Guard and the Solar Alliance, to uphold the cause
of peace throughout the universe and defend the liberties
of the planets. Your idea is to destroy peace and
make slaves out of the people of Venus&mdash;like these dummies
you've got here!" Astro gestured contemptuously
at the men standing on both sides of Lactu. "I don't
want any part of you, so start blasting!" continued the
big cadet, his voice booming out in the big room. "But
make it good, 'cause I'm tough!"</p>

<p>There was a murmur among the men and several put
their hands on the butts of their paralo-ray guns. Even
the calm expression in Lactu's eyes changed.</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of us, are you?" he asked in a low,
almost surprised tone of voice.</p>

<p>"You, nor anything that crawls in the jungle like
you!" shouted Astro. "If you're not happy with the way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>things are run on Venus, why don't you take your beef
to the Solar Alliance?"</p>

<p>"We prefer to do it our way!" snapped one of the men
near Lactu. "And as for you, a few lashes with a Venusian
wet whip will teach you to keep a civil tongue!"</p>

<p>Astro turned around slowly, looking at each of the
men individually. "I promise you," he said slowly, "the
first man who lays a whip on me will die."</p>

<p>"And who, pray, will do the killing?" snorted a short,
stout figure in the darkest of the green uniforms. "You?
Hardly!"</p>

<p>"If it isn't me"&mdash;Astro turned to face the man&mdash;"it
will be any one of a thousand Space Cadets."</p>

<p>"You have a lot of confidence in yourself and your
friends," said Lactu. "Death apparently doesn't frighten
you."</p>

<p>"No more than it does any man of honor," said the
cadet. "I've faced death before. As for my friends"&mdash;Astro
shrugged and grinned&mdash;"touch me and wait for
what happens. And by the stars, mister, you can depend
on it happening!"</p>

<p>"Enough of this, Lactu!" said a man near the end of
the group. "We have important business to conduct.
Take this foolish boy out and do away with him!"</p>

<p>Lactu waved his hand gently. "Observe, gentlemen,
here is the true spirit of Venus. This boy is not an
Earthman, nor a Martian. He is a Venusian&mdash;a proud
Venusian who has drifted with the tides of space and
taken life where he found it. Tell me honestly, gentlemen,
what would you have thought of Astro, a Venusian,
if he had acted any differently than he has? If he
had taken an oath he does not believe and groveled at
our feet? No, gentlemen, to kill this proud, freeborn Venusian
would be a crime. Tell me, Astro, do you have
any skills?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<p>"I can handle nuclear materials in any form."</p>

<p>"We are wasting time, Lactu!" exclaimed one of the
men suddenly. "Settle with this upstart later. Now let
us take a vote on the issue before us. The ship is waiting
to blast off for Mercury. Do we ask for her assistance,
or not?"</p>

<p>There was a loud murmur among the assembled men,
and Lactu held up his hand. "Very well, we will vote.
All in favor of asking the people of Mercury to join our
movement against the Alliance will say aye!"</p>

<p>"Aye," chorused the men.</p>

<p>"Against?"</p>

<p>Lactu looked around, but there was no reply.</p>

<p>Lactu turned back to Astro. "Well, Venusian, this is
your last chance to join forces with us and to fight for
your mother planet."</p>

<p>"Go blast your jets!" snapped Astro. Immediately
Lactu's eyes became hard steely points.</p>

<p>"That was your last chance!" he said. "Take him out
and kill him!"</p>

<p>The door suddenly burst open and a green-clad
trooper raced across the bare floor, bowing hastily before
Lactu. "Forgive this interruption, Lactu," he said
breathlessly. "There are men in the jungle headed for
the canyon rim. Three of them!"</p>

<p>Lactu turned to Astro. "Your friends, no doubt!" He
snapped an order. "Capture them and bring them to
me. And as for you, Astro, we are in need of capable
men to build war heads for our space torpedoes. To ensure
the safety of your friends, I would advise your
working for us. If not, your friends will die before another
night falls."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_12" id="CHAPTER_12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>


<p>"You're right, Tom," said Major Connel. "They must be
around here somewhere. Start looking. If they're not
here, it may mean he's still alive."</p>

<p>It was Tom who had thought of looking for Astro's
weapons. Refusing to believe that his unit mate had
been killed, the curly-haired cadet was examining the
torn jungle suit when the idea occurred to him.</p>

<p>Quickly Roger, Connel, and Tom spread out over the
trampled area, searching the underbrush for Astro's
paralo-ray pistol or shock rifle. Connel examined the
underbrush and vines closely for scorch marks made by
the blaster. Finding none, he rejoined the boys.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," replied Roger.</p>

<p>"Can't find them, Major," said Tom.</p>

<p>Connel smacked his fists together and spoke excitedly.
"I'm sure Astro wouldn't be caught unawares by a
couple of things like a snake or a tyrannosaurus without
putting up a fight. If he was attacked suddenly, he
would have fired at least one shot, and if it went wild,
it would have burned the vines and brush around here.
You didn't find his weapons, and there are no scorched
areas. I'll stake my life on it, Astro's alive!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>Roger's and Tom's faces brightened. They knew Connel
had no proof, but they were willing to believe anything
that would keep their hopes for their giant unit
mate alive.</p>

<p>"Now," said Connel, "assuming he is not dead, and
that he is somewhere in the jungle, we have to figure
out what he would do."</p>

<p>Roger was thoughtful a moment. "How long would
he last without his jungle suit, sir?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>Tom's eyes lit up. "If he's alive, sir, then he's probably
following a path or trail that would keep him away
from heavy underbrush," he said.</p>

<p>Connel thought a moment. "There's only one trail
away from here." He turned and pointed to the trail
made by the tyrannosaurus. "That one."</p>

<p>The three spacemen stared at the wide path left by
the huge beast. Connel hesitated. "It's due north," he
said finally. "We've come a full day west and should be
making a turn north. We'll follow the tyrannosaurus's
trail for a full day."</p>

<p>Roger and Tom grinned. They knew Connel was
making every effort to find Astro, while still keeping his
mission in mind.</p>

<p>The three spacemen moved along the trail quickly,
eyes alert for any sign Astro might have left. Connel
saw the great bloodstains left by the tyrannosaurus and
cautioned the two cadets. "This tyranno is wounded
pretty badly. It might be heading back for its lair, but
it might not make it, and stop along the way. Be careful
and keep your eyes open for any sign that he might
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Connel was stopped by Tom's sudden cry. "Major!
Look!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>Connel turned and stared. A thousand yards ahead of
them on the broken trail they saw the monstrous bulk
of a tyrannosaurus emerge from the gloom.</p>

<p>"By the rings of Saturn," breathed Connel, "that's the
one!"</p>

<p>The great beast spotted the three Earthmen at the
same instant. It raised itself on its hind legs, and shaking
its massive head in anger, started to charge down
its own trail toward them.</p>

<p>"Disperse!" cried Connel. "Take cover!"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger darted to one side of the trail while
Connel dived for the other. Taking cover behind a tree,
the boys turned and pointed their rifles down the trail.
They saw that the tyrannosaurus had already covered
half the distance between them.</p>

<p>"Aim for the legs!" shouted Connel, from his place of
concealment. "Don't try for a head shot! He's moving
too fast! Give it to him in the legs. Try to cut him
down!"</p>

<p>Roger and Tom lay flat on the ground and trained
their rifles on the approaching beast.</p>

<p>"I'll take the right leg," said Roger. "You take the left,
Tom."</p>

<p>"On target!" replied Tom, squinting through the
sight.</p>

<p>"Ready!" Connel's voice roared across the trail.</p>

<p>Only a hundred and fifty feet away the tyrannosaurus,
hearing Connel's voice, suddenly stopped. Its head
weaved back and forth as though it suspected a trap.</p>

<p>"Fire!" roared Connel.</p>

<p>Tom and Roger fired together, but at the same moment
the monster lunged toward Connel's position.
Both shots missed, the energy charges merely scorching
its sides.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-138.png" width="500" height="425" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The tyrannosaurus roared with anger and turned toward
the boys, head down and the claws of its short
forelegs extended.</p>

<p>At that moment Connel opened fire, aiming for the
monster's vulnerable neck. But it was well protected
behind its shoulders and the spaceman only succeeded
in drawing the beast's attention back to himself.</p>

<p>At this instant Tom and Roger opened fire again,
sending violent shock charges into the beast's hide.
Caught in the withering cross fire, it turned blindly on
the boys and charged at them. The two cadets fired
coolly, rapidly, unable to miss the great bulk. The air
became acrid with the sharp odor of ionized air. Maddened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>now beyond the limits of its endurance, hit
at least twenty times and wild with pain, the great
king of the Venusian jungle bore down on the two
cadets.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-139.png" width="500" height="429" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Roger and Tom saw that their fire was not going to
stop the tyrannosaurus's charge. They were pouring a
nearly steady stream of fire into the monster now, while
on the other side of the trail Connel was doing the
same, raking the monstrous hulk from the forelegs to
the hindquarters.</p>

<p>The boys jumped back, Tom still facing the beast
and firing his rifle from the waist. But Roger stumbled
in the tangle of the underbrush and fell backward,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>dropping his rifle. The beast's head swooped low, jaws
open.</p>

<p>Seeing Roger's danger, Tom jumped downward again
without hesitation and fired point-blank at the beast's
scaly head, only ten feet away.</p>

<p>The monster roared in sudden agony and pulled
back, jerking his head up against a thick branch of the
tree overhead. The limb tore loose under the impact
and fell crashing to the ground on top of Roger.</p>

<p>From behind, Connel stepped closer to the tyrannosaurus
and fired from a twenty-five-foot range. It wavered
and stumbled back, obviously mortally wounded.
From both sides Tom and Connel poured their weapons'
power into the giant beast. Blinded, near death,
the monster wavered uncertainly. Bellowing in fear and
pain, it turned and lumbered back down the trail.</p>

<p>Connel and Tom watched it until they were certain it
could not attack them without warning again, and then
they hurried to Roger. The heavy tree limb had landed
across his back, pinning him to the ground.</p>

<p>"Roger!" yelled Tom. "Roger, are you all right?"</p>

<p>The blond-haired cadet didn't answer. Grabbing a
stout branch lying on the ground near by, Connel and
Tom worked it beneath the limb which lay across Roger's
body and pried it up.</p>

<p>"I've got it," said Connel, holding the weight of the
limb on his shoulder. "Pull him out!"</p>

<p>Tom quickly pulled the unconscious cadet clear and
laid him on the ground. Dropping the limb, Connel
bent down to examine the boy. He ran his fingers along
Roger's spine, feeling the bones one by one through the
skin-tight jungle suit. Finally he straightened and shook
his head. "I can't tell anything," he said. "We'll have to
take him back to Sinclair's right away." He stood up.
"I'll make a stretcher for him. Meanwhile, you go after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>that tyranno and finish him off. He's pretty far gone,
but you never can tell."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied Tom. He picked up his rifle
and reloaded it, checking it carefully. He repeated the
precaution with Roger's blaster.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," urged Connel, already reaching for a
suitable branch. "Time means everything now."</p>

<p>"Be right back, sir," replied Tom. And as he walked
away, he looked back at the unconscious form of his
unit mate. He could not help reflecting on the bitter
fact that already two members of the expedition were
in danger, and they were no closer to their goal of finding
the Nationalists' hidden base.</p>

<p>Moving carefully, one of the two rifles slung over his
shoulder, the other in his hand ready for use, Tom followed
the trail of the tyrannosaurus. Two thousand
yards farther along he saw a place where the monster
had fallen and then struggled back to its feet to stagger
on. Rounding a turn in the trail, Tom stopped abruptly.
Before him, not a hundred feet away, the beast lay
sprawled on the ground. The area all around was devoid
of any vegetation. It was trampled down to the
black soil. Tom deduced that it was the beast's lair. He
pressed forward cautiously until he was a scant thirty
feet away, and crouched between the roots of a huge
tree where he would be protected should the monster
be able to rise and fight again.</p>

<p>Sighting carefully on the base of the monster's neck,
he squeezed the trigger of the shock rifle. A full energy
charge hit the tyrannosaurus in its most vulnerable
spot. It jerked under the sudden blast, involuntarily
tried to rise to its feet, and then fell back, the ground
shaking under the impact of its thirty tons. Then, after
one convulsive kick with its hind legs that uprooted a
near-by tree, the beast stiffened and lay still.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom waited, watching the beast for signs of life.
After five minutes he stepped forward cautiously, his
rifle ready. He circled the tyrannosaurus slowly. The
great bulk towered above him, and the cadet's eyes
widened in amazement at the size of the fallen giant.
Stopping at its head, which was as wide as he was tall,
Tom looked at the jaws and teeth that had torn so many
foes into bloody bits, and shook his head. He had come
to the jungle to kill just such a beast. But with Astro
missing and Roger unconscious the thrill of victory was
somehow missing. He turned and headed back down
the trail.</p>

<p>Connel had finished the litter by the time Tom returned,
and the officer was leaning over the blond-haired
cadet, examining his back again.</p>

<p>"We'd better move out right away, Tom," said Connel.
"I still can't tell what's wrong. It may be serious,
and then it may be nothing more than just shock. But
we can't take a chance."</p>

<p>Tom nodded. "Very well, sir." He adjusted his shoulder
pack, slung both rifles over his shoulder, and
started to pick up his end of the litter when suddenly
the jungle silence was shattered by a deafening roar.
Connel jumped to his feet!</p>

<p>"Corbett!" he cried. "That's a rocket ship blasting
off!"</p>

<p>"It sure sounded like it, sir," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"And I'll stake my life it's not more than a half mile
away!"</p>

<p>The two men jumped out into the trail and scanned
the sky. The unmistakable roar of a spaceship echoed
through the jungle. The ship was accelerating, and the
reverberations of the rocket exhaust rolled over the
treetops. Suddenly a flash of gleaming metal streaked
across the sky and Connel roared.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>"We've found it, Corbett!" He slapped the cadet on
the back. "The Nationalists' base! We've found it!"</p>

<p>Tom nodded, a half-smile on his face. "We sure have,
Major." He hesitated a moment. "You know, sir, if
Roger is really badly hurt we might not make it back to
Sinclair's in time, so&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

<p>"I know what you're thinking, Tom," said the officer,
"and I agree. But one of us has to go back with the information."</p>

<p>"You go, sir," said Tom. "I'll take Roger and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't carry him alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can make it somehow," protested Tom.</p>

<p>Connel shook his head. "I'll help you."</p>

<p>"You mean, you're going to allow yourself to be captured
too?" spluttered Tom.</p>

<p>"Not quite." Connel smiled. "But a good intelligence
agent gets as much information as he can. And he gets
correct information! I'll help you get him to the base
and you can take him on in for medical attention. I'll
get back to Sinclair's later."</p>

<p>Tom tried to protest, but the burly spaceman had
turned away.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_13" id="CHAPTER_13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>


<p>"Stand where you are!"</p>

<p>Tom and Major Connel stiffened and looked around,
the unconscious form of Roger stretched between them
on the litter. From the jungle around them, green-clad
Nationalists suddenly emerged, brandishing their guns.</p>

<p>"Put Roger down," muttered Connel quietly. "Don't
try anything."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," replied Tom, and they lowered the
litter to the ground gently.</p>

<p>"Raise your hands!" came the second command from
a man who appeared directly in front of them.</p>

<p>Standing squarely in front of them, the little man
said something in the Venusian dialect and waited, but
Connel and Tom remained silent.</p>

<p>"I guess you don't speak the Venusian tongue," he
sneered. "So I'll have to use the disgusting language of
Earth!" He looked down at the unconscious form of
Roger. "What happened to him?"</p>

<p>"He was injured in a fight with a tyrannosaurus," replied
Connel. "May I remind you that you and these
men are holding guns on an officer of the Solar Guard.
Such a crime is punishable by two years on a prison
asteroid!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>"You'll be the one to go to prison, my stout friend!"
The man laughed. "A little work in the shops will take
some of that waistline off you!"</p>

<p>"Are you taking us prisoner?"</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I see." Connel seemed to consider for a moment.
"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am Drifi, squad officer of the jungle patrol."</p>

<p>"Connel, Senior Officer, Solar Guard," acknowledged
Connel. "If we are being held prisoner, I wish to make
a request."</p>

<p>"Prisoners don't make requests," said Drifi, and then
added suspiciously, "What is it?"</p>

<p>"See that this man"&mdash;Connel indicated Roger&mdash;"is
given medical attention at once."</p>

<p>Drifi eyed the major cautiously.</p>

<p>"I make this request as one officer to another," said
Connel. "A point of honor between opponents."</p>

<p>Drifi's eyes gleamed visibly at the word <i>officer</i>, and
Tom almost grinned at Connel's subtle flattery.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;and you," snapped Drifi at the green-clad men
around them, "see that this man is taken to the medical
center immediately!" Two men jumped to pick up the
litter.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Connel. "Now will you be so kind
as to tell me what this is all about?"</p>

<p>"You'll find out soon enough. We have a special way
of treating spies."</p>

<p>"Spies!" roared Connel. The officer sounded so indignant
that Tom was almost fooled by his tone. "We're
hunters! One of our party is lost here in the jungle. We
were searching for him when we were attacked by a
tyrannosaurus. During the fight, this man was injured.
We're not spies!"</p>

<p>Drifi shrugged his shoulders, and barking a command
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>to his men, turned into the jungle. Connel and
Tom were forced to follow.</p>

<p>They were taken to the giant teakwood that Astro
had seen, and Tom and Connel watched silently as the
door opened, revealing the vacuum tube. The men
crowded into the car and it dropped to the lower level.</p>

<p>Following the same twisting turns in the tunnels,
Tom and Connel were brought to the armory and saw
the men surrender their weapons and change their helmets
and shoes. They tried desperately to get a look at
the faces of the men around them while the headgear
was being changed, but, as before, the men were careful
to keep their faces averted.</p>

<p>Continuing down the tunnel, Connel tried to speak
to Drifi again. "I would appreciate it greatly, sir," he
said in his most formal military manner, "if you could
give me any news about the other man of our party.
Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>Drifi did not answer. He marched stiffly ahead, not
even bothering to look at Connel.</p>

<p>As they neared the exit, Connel drifted imperceptibly
closer to Tom and whispered out of the side of his
mouth, "Keep your eyes open for ships. Count as many
as you can. How many are armed, their size, and so on.
Look for ammunition dumps. Check radar and communications
installations. Get as much information as
you can, in case only one of us can escape."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," whispered Tom. "Do you think they might
have Astro?"</p>

<p>"It's a good guess. We were following the tyrannosaurus's
trail when they caught us, and I'm pretty
sure Astro had been doing the same thing."</p>

<p>"Stop that talking!" snapped Drifi, suddenly whirling
on them. "You," he shouted at one of the guards, "get
up here and keep them apart!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>A guard stepped quickly between Tom and Connel,
and the conversation ended.</p>

<p>At the exit Connel and Tom stopped involuntarily
at the sight before them. Astro had entered the canyon
near twilight, but the two spacemen got a view of the
Nationalists' base under the full noon sun. Connel
gasped and muttered a space oath. Tom turned halfway
to his superior and was starting to speak when both
were shoved rudely ahead. "Keep moving," a guard
growled.</p>

<p>As they walked, their eyes flicked over the canyon,
alert for details. Tom counted the ships arrayed neatly
on the spaceport some distance away, then counted
others outside repair shops with men scurrying over
them like so many ants. Near the center of the canyon
the bare trunk of a giant teakwood soared skyward, a
gigantic communications tower. Tom scanned the revolving
antenna, and from its shape and size deduced
the power and type of radar being used at the base. He
admitted to himself that the Nationalists had the latest
and best. Connel was busy too, noting buildings of
identical design scattered around the canyon floor that
were too small to be spaceship hangars or storage depots.
He guessed that they were housings for vacuum-tube
elevator shafts that led to underground caves.</p>

<p>The canyon echoed with the splutter of arc welders,
the slow banging of iron workers, the cough and hissing
of jet sleds, the roar of activity that meant deadly danger
to the Solar Alliance. Connel noticed as he moved
across the canyon floor that the workers were in good
spirits. The morale of the rebels, thought the space
officer, was good! Too good!</p>

<p>At a momentary halt in their march, when Drifi
stopped to speak with a sentry, Tom and Connel found
an opportunity to speak again.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>"I've counted a dozen big converted freighters on the
blast ramps, sir," whispered Tom hurriedly. "Three more
being repaired, nearly finished, and there are about
fifty smaller ships, all heavily armed."</p>

<p>"That checks with my count, Tom," replied Connel
hurriedly. "What do you make of the radar?"</p>

<p>"At least as good as we have!"</p>

<p>"I thought so, too! If a Solar Guard squadron tried to
attack this base now, they'd be spotted and blasted out
of space!"</p>

<p>"What about stores, sir?" asked Tom. "I didn't see
anything like a supply depot."</p>

<p>Connel told him of the small buildings which he believed
housed the elevator shafts to underground storerooms.
"Only one thing is missing!" he concluded.</p>

<p>"What's that, sir?"</p>

<p>"The nuclear chambers where they produce ammunition
for their fleet."</p>

<p>"It must be underground too, sir," said Tom. "There
isn't a building in the canyon that's made of concrete
and steel."</p>

<p>"Right. Either that, or it's back up there in the cliffs
in one of those tunnels!" The officer snorted. "By the
stars, Corbett, this place is an atom bomb ready to go
off in the lap of the Solar Alliance."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do, sir?" asked Tom. "So far,
it looks as if it's going to be tough to get out again."</p>

<p>"We'll have to wait for a break, Tom," sighed Connel.</p>

<p>"I hope they've taken good care of Roger," said the
cadet in a low voice. "And I hope they've got Astro."</p>

<p>"Watch it," warned Connel. "Drifi's coming back. Remember,
if we're separated and you do manage to escape,
get back to Sinclair's. Contact Commander Walters
and tell him everything that's happened. The code
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>name for direct emergency contact through Solar Guard
communications center in Venusport is Juggernaut!"</p>

<p>"Juggernaut!" repeated Tom in a whisper. "Very well,
sir. But I sure hope we aren't separated."</p>

<p>"Well have to take what comes. <i>Sh!</i> Here he comes."</p>

<p>"All right, let's go," said the patrol leader.</p>

<p>They continued across the canyon until they
reached a four-story wooden structure without windows.
Drifi opened a small door and motioned them inside.</p>

<p>"What is this?" Connel demanded.</p>

<p>"This is where you'll stay until Lactu sends for you.
Right now, he is in conference with the Division Leaders."</p>

<p>"Divisions of what? Ships? Men?" asked Connel offhandedly,
trying not to show any more than idle curiosity.</p>

<p>"You'll find out when the Solar Guard comes looking
for a fight," said Drifi. "Now get in there!"</p>

<p>Tom and Connel were shoved inside and the door
closed behind them. It was pitch black, and they
couldn't see an inch in front of their faces. But both
Tom and Connel knew instantly that they were not
alone.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Come on. Gimme that wrench!" barked Astro. The
little man beside him handed up the wrench and leaned
over the side of the engine casing to watch Astro pull
the nut tight. "Now get over there and throw on the
switch," snapped the big cadet.</p>

<p>The little man scurried over to one side of the vast
machine shop and flipped on the wall switch. There
was an audible hum of power and then slowly the machine
Astro had just worked on began to speed up, soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>revving up to ten thousand revolutions per minute.</p>

<p>"Is it fixed?" demanded the shop foreman, coming up
beside Astro.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she's fixed. But I don't work on another job
until you give me another helper. That asteroid head
you gave me doesn't know a&mdash;" Astro stopped. Something
out beyond the double doors caught his eye. It
was the sight of Tom and Connel entering the wooden
building.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?" demanded the foreman.</p>

<p>"Huh? What? Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;well, he's O.K., I guess,"
Astro stammered. "It's just that he's a little green, that's
all."</p>

<p>"Well, get to work on that heater in chamber number
one. It's burned a bearing. Change it, and hurry up
about it!"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;sure!" The big cadet grinned.</p>

<p>"Say, what's the matter with you?" asked the foreman,
staring at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I'm O.K.," replied Astro quickly.</p>

<p>The foreman continued to stare at Astro as the big
cadet turned to his assistant nonchalantly. "Come on,
genius, get that box of tools over to the heater!" he
shouted. As he turned away, the foreman nodded to the
green-clad guard, who followed closely behind Astro,
his hand on the butt of his paralo-ray gun.</p>

<p>Seeing the little assistant struggling with the heavy
box, Astro stopped and picked it out of his arms with
one hand. Grinning, he held it straight out and then
slowly brought it around in a complete circle over his
head, still holding it with only one hand. The guard's
eyes widened behind his plastic helmet at this show of
strength.</p>

<p>"You're very strong, Astro," he said, "but you are altogether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>too contemptuous of a fellow Venusian." He
nodded to the small assistant.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Astro. His grin hardened and he
leaned forward slightly, balancing on the balls of his
feet. "That goes for you and every other green space
monkey in this place. Drop that ray gun and I'll tie you
up in a knot!"</p>

<p>Frightened, the guard pulled the paralo-ray gun out
of its holster, but Astro quickly stepped in and sank his
fist deep into the guard's stomach. The man dropped
like a stone. Astro grinned and turned his back to walk
toward the heater. He heard the other workers begin
to chatter excitedly, but he didn't pay any attention to
them.</p>

<p>"Astro! Astro!" His little assistant ran up beside him.
"You hit a division guard!"</p>

<p>"I did, huh?" replied the big cadet in an innocent
tone. "What kind of a division?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? Venus has been divided into areas
called divisions. Each division has a chief, and every
Venusian citizen in that division is under his personal
jurisdiction."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh," said Astro vaguely. He climbed up on to
the machine and began taking off the outer casing.</p>

<p>"The best men in the division are made the Division
Chief's personal guards."</p>

<p>"What happens to the second and third and fourth
best men?"</p>

<p>"Well, they're given jobs here according to their
knowledge and capacities."</p>

<p>"What was your job before you came here?"</p>

<p>"I was a field worker on my chief's plantation."</p>

<p>"Why did you join?" asked Astro. "Did you think it
better to have Venusians ruling Venus, instead of belonging
to the Solar Alliance?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p>"I didn't think about it at all," admitted the little
man. "Besides, I didn't join. I was recruited. My chief
just put me on a ship and here I am."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it, now that you're here?"
asked Astro. He began running his fingers along a few
of the valves, apparently paying no attention to the
guard who was just now staggering to his feet.</p>

<p>The little assistant paused and considered Astro's
question. Finally he replied weakly, "I don't know. It's
all right, I guess. It's better here in the shops than in
the caves where the others go."</p>

<p>"Others? What others?"</p>

<p>"Those that don't like it," replied the man. "They're
sent to the caves."</p>

<p>"What caves?"</p>

<p>"Up in the cliff. The tunnels&mdash;" He suddenly stopped
when an angry shout echoed in the machine shop. The
guard Astro had hit rushed up. He turned to several
workmen near by. "Take this blabbering idiot to the
caves!" he ordered angrily.</p>

<p>Astro slowly climbed down from the machine and
faced the guard menacingly. As the guard's finger tightened
on the trigger of his paralo-ray gun, the foreman
suddenly rushed up and knocked the gun out of his
hand. "You fool! You stiffen this man and we'll be held
up in production for hours!"</p>

<p>"So what!" sneered the guard.</p>

<p>"Lactu and your Division Chief will tell you so what!"
barked the foreman. He turned to Astro. "And as for
you, if you try anything like that again, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't do a thing," said Astro casually. "I'm the
best man you've got and you know it. Lactu knows it
too. So don't threaten me and keep these green space
jerks away from me! I'll fix your machines, because I
want to, not because you can make me!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>The foreman eyed the big cadet curiously. "Because
you want to? You've changed your tune since you first
came here."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Astro. "Maybe I like what I see around
here. It all depends."</p>

<p>"Well, make up your mind later," barked the foreman.
"Now get that machine fixed!"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Astro simply, turning back to the machine
and starting to whistle. Strangely enough, he was
happy. He was a prisoner, but he felt better than he
had in days. Just knowing that Tom and Major Connel
were right across the canyon gave him a surge of confidence.
Working over the machine quickly, surely, the
big cadet began to formulate a plan. Now was the time!
They were together again. Now was the time to escape!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_14" id="CHAPTER_14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>


<p>"Put your back against the door, Tom!" snapped Connel.
"Quickly!"</p>

<p>Tom felt the powerful grip of the Solar Guard officer's
fingers on his arm as he was pulled backward. He
closed his eyes, then opened them, hoping to pierce the
darkness, but he saw nothing. Beside him, he could
sense the tenseness in Connel's body.</p>

<p>There was a rustle of movement to the right of them.</p>

<p>"Careful, Tom," cautioned Connel. "To your right!"</p>

<p>"I hear it, sir," said Tom, turning toward the noise
and bracing himself.</p>

<p>"My name is Connel," the burly spaceman suddenly
spoke up in loud tones. "I'm an official in the Solar
Guard! Whoever you are, speak up! Identify yourself."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence and then a voice
spoke harshly in the darkness.</p>

<p>"How do we know you're a Solar Guard officer? How
do we know you're not a spy?"</p>

<p>"Do you have any kind of light?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have a light. But we are not going to give
away our positions. We know how to move in here. You
don't."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then how do you expect me to prove it?"</p>

<p>"The burden of proof lies with you."</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of me?" asked Connel after a
pause.</p>

<p>"We know there is an officer in the Solar Guard
named Connel."</p>

<p>"I am that officer," asserted Connel. "I was sent into
the jungle to find this base, but one of our party was
injured and we were captured by a patrol."</p>

<p>Tom and Connel heard voices whispering in the darkness
and then a loud order.</p>

<p>"Lie down on the floor, both of you!"</p>

<p>The two spacemen hesitated and then got down flat
on their backs.</p>

<p>"Close your eyes and lie still. One of us here knows
what Connel looks like. I hope for your sake that you're
telling the truth. If you're not&mdash;" The voice stopped but
the threat was plain.</p>

<p>"Do as they say, Tom," said Connel.</p>

<p>The cadet closed his eyes and he heard the shuffle of
feet around them. Suddenly there was a flash of light on
his face but he kept his eyes tightly closed. The light
moved away, but he could tell that it was still burning.</p>

<p>"It's Connel, I think," said a high-pitched voice directly
over them.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Pretty sure. I met him once in Atom City at a scientific
meeting. He was making a speech with a Professor
Sykes."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Connel, hearing the remark. "I
was there."</p>

<p>"Do you remember meeting a man from Venus wearing
a long red robe?" asked the high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>Connel hesitated. "No," he said. "I only remember
talking to three men. Two were from Venus and one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>was from Mars. But neither of the two from Venus wore
a red robe. They wore purple&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's right," acknowledged the voice. "This is Connel."</p>

<p>"Open your eyes," said the first voice.</p>

<p>Connel and Tom opened their eyes and in the light
of a small hand torch they saw two gaunt faces before
them. The tallest of the men stuck out a bony hand.
"My name is Carson." They recognized his voice as the
one that had spoken first. "And this is Bill Jensen," he
added.</p>

<p>"This is Tom Corbett, Space Cadet," said Connel. He
glanced around the room, and in the weak reflected
light of the torch, saw almost fifty men crouched against
the walls, each of them holding a crude weapon.</p>

<p>"You'll understand our caution, Major," said Carson.
"Once before we had a plan to escape and a spy was
sent in. As you see, we didn't escape."</p>

<p>"Neither did the spy," commented Jensen grimly.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"The oldest prisoner has been here for three years,"
replied Carson. And as the other men began to gather
around them, Connel and Tom saw that they were
hardly more than walking skeletons. Their cheeks were
hollow, eyes sunk in their sockets, and they wore little
more than rags.</p>

<p>"And there's no way to escape?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Three guards with blasters are stationed on the
other side of that door," said Carson. "There is no other
entrance or exit. We tried a tunnel, but it caved in and
after that they put in a wooden floor." He stamped on
it. "Teak. Hard as steel. We couldn't cut through."</p>

<p>"But why are you being held prisoners?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"All of us joined the Nationalists believing it was just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>a sort of good-neighbor club, where we could get together
and exchange ideas for our own improvement.
And when we found out what Lactu and the Division
Chiefs were really up to, we tried to quit. As you see,
we couldn't. We knew too much."</p>

<p>"Blasted rebels!" muttered Connel. "The Solar Guard
will cool them off!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's too late," said Carson. "They're preparing
to strike now. I've been expecting it for some
time. They have enough ships and arms to wipe out the
entire Solar Guard garrison here on Venus in one attack!"
He shook his head. "After that, with Solar Guard
ships and complete control of the planet&mdash;" He paused
and sighed. "It will mean a long, bloody space war."</p>

<p>Tom and Connel plied the prisoners with questions
and soon began to get a complete picture of the scope
of the Nationalist movement.</p>

<p>"Lactu and his commanders should be sent to a prison
asteroid for life," said Carson, "for what they have done
to former Nationalists."</p>

<p>"Hundreds of unsuspecting Venusians have been
brought here under the guise of helping to free Venus.
But when they come and recognize what Lactu really
intends to do, they want to quit. But it's too late, and
they're sent to the caves."</p>

<p>Tom looked at the gaunt man fearfully. There was
something in his voice that sent a chill down his spine.</p>

<p>"They are driven like cattle into the canyon walls,"
continued Carson. "There they are forced to dig the
huge underground vaults for storage dumps. They are
beaten and whipped and starved."</p>

<p>"Why aren't you in the caves then?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"Some of us were," replied Carson. "But each of us
here owns land and it is necessary to keep us alive to
send back directives to our bankers and foremen to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>give aid in one form or another to Sharkey and the Division
Chiefs."</p>

<p>"I see," said Connel. "If you were to die, then your
property would be out of their reach."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Carson.</p>

<p>"Is Sharkey the real leader of the movement?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe so. But then, no one knows. That's
the idea of the frosted helmets. If you don't know who a
man is, you can liquidate him without conscience. He
may be your closest friend, but you would never know
it."</p>

<p>"The blasted space crawlers!" growled Connel. "Well,
they'll pay!"</p>

<p>"You have a plan?" asked Carson eagerly.</p>

<p>"No," said Connel slowly, "but at least we all have
more of a chance now."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Carson.</p>

<p>"The Solar Guard sent us here to find this base. If we
don't return, or send some sort of message back within
a reasonable time, this jungle will be swarming with
guardsmen!"</p>

<p>Carson looked a little disappointed. "We shall see,"
he said.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There were three things on Astro's mind as twilight
darkened into night over the canyon. One, he had to
find out why Roger wasn't with Tom and Connel when
they were taken into the building; two, he had to figure
out a way to contact Tom and Connel; and finally, he
had to escape himself, or help Tom and Connel escape.</p>

<p>The big cadet finished the last job in the machine
shop. It had taken very little time, but the big cadet had
lingered over it, trying to find answers to his three problems.
Around him, the workers were leaving their
benches and lathes, to be replaced by still others. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>twelve-hour shift was being used by the Nationalists
in their frantic preparations for an attack on the Venusport
garrison of the Solar Guard. Astro finally dropped
the last wrench into the tool kit and straightened up.
He stretched leisurely and glanced over at his guard.
The man was still rubbing his stomach where Astro had
hit him, and he watched the big cadet with a murderous
gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>"All finished," said Astro. "Where and when do I
eat?"</p>

<p>"If I had my way, you wouldn't," sneered the guard.</p>

<p>"Either I knock off and eat," said Astro confidently,
"or I call the foreman and you talk to Lactu."</p>

<p>"Feeling pretty big, aren't you?" growled the guard.
"I haven't forgotten that punch in the stomach."</p>

<p>"Why, I hardly touched you," said Astro in mock surprise.</p>

<p>The guard glared at him, muttered an oath, and
turned away. Astro could see that he was boiling, almost
out of his mind with helpless, frustrated anger,
and suddenly the young cadet realized how he would
be able to move about the base freely. Grinning, he
walked arrogantly in front of the guard and out of the
shop into the dark Venusian night. It was very warm
and many of the workers had stripped down to their
trousers. He passed the open doorway of a large tool
shop and glanced inside. It was empty. The men had
apparently gone to eat. He suddenly stopped, turned
to the guard, and growled, "If you want to settle our
differences now, we can step inside."</p>

<p>The guard hesitated and glared at Astro. "When I
settle with you, big boy, you'll know about it."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with right now?" asked Astro.
"Yellow?" He turned and walked into the tool shop
without looking back. The guard rushed after him. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>the big cadet had carefully gauged the distance between
them, and when he heard the rushing steps of
the guard immediately behind him, he suddenly spun
around, swinging a roundhouse right, catching the
guard in the pit of the stomach again. The man stopped
dead in his tracks. His eyes bulged and glazed, and he
dropped to the floor like a stone. Astro pulled the man
to the corner of the empty shop, removed the plastic
helmet, and then tied and gagged him. He pulled the
helmet over his own head, nearly tearing one ear off,
grabbed the gun and stepped back outside. He stood in
front of the door and glanced up and down the area
between the buildings. Fifty feet away a group of men
were working over a tube casing, but they didn't even
look up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-160.png" width="500" height="429" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Staying in the shadows, he walked down the lane,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>moving carefully. The plastic helmet would keep him
from being recognized right away, but to complete his
plan, he needed one of the green uniforms of the
guards.</p>

<p>Deciding it would be too risky to walk around the
base, he crouched behind a huge crate of machinery at
the head of the lane. Sentries were constantly patrolling
the area and he was certain that one would pass by
soon. He only hoped the man would be big enough.
Fifteen minutes later the cadet heard footsteps in a
slow measured tread. He peered around the edge of
the crate and silently breathed a thankful prayer. It was
a green-clad guard, and luckily, almost as big as he
was.</p>

<p>Crouching in the shadow of the crate, Astro tensed
for the attack. It had to be quick and it had to be silent.
He couldn't club the guard because of his helmet. He
would have to get him around the throat to choke off
any outcry.</p>

<p>The slow steps came nearer and the big cadet raised
himself on the balls of his feet, ready to spring. When
the guard's shadow fell across him, Astro leaped forward
like a striking tiger.</p>

<p>The guard didn't have a chance. Astro's arm coiled
around his throat and the cry of alarm that welled up
within him died down in a choking gasp. Within seconds
he was unconscious and the big cadet had dragged
him behind the crate. He stripped him of his uniform,
bound and gagged him with his own rags, and crammed
him into the crate. Then, protected by the helmet and
green uniform and carrying the blaster, the cadet
stepped out confidently and strode down the lane.</p>

<p>He went directly to the building he had seen Tom
and Connel enter, and walked boldly up to the guard
lounging in front of the door.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>"You're relieved," said Astro in the Venusian dialect.
"They want you up in the caves." The cadet had no
idea where the caves were, but he knew that they
couldn't be near by and it would be some time before
an alarm could be sounded.</p>

<p>"The caves?" asked the guard. "Who said so?"</p>

<p>"The chief. He wants you to identify somebody."</p>

<p>"Me? Identify someone? I don't understand." The
guard was puzzled. "What section of the caves?"</p>

<p>"The new section," said Astro quickly, figuring there
must be a new and an old section because he had heard
a guard refer to the old one.</p>

<p>"Up by the jungle tunnels?"</p>

<p>Astro nodded.</p>

<p>"Must be more of those Solar Guardsmen," said the
guard, relaxing. "We have two of them in here, another
in the hospital, and one of them working in the machine
shop."</p>

<p>Hospital! Astro gulped. That would be Roger. But he
dared not ask too many questions. "What's going to
happen to them?" he asked casually.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the guard, "but I wish we'd
hurry up and attack Venusport. I'm getting tired of
living out here in the jungle."</p>

<p>"Me too," said Astro. "Well, you'd better get going."</p>

<p>The guard nodded and started to walk away. Suddenly
Astro stiffened. Two other guards were rounding
the corner of the building. He called to the departing
guard quickly. "Who's on duty with you tonight?"</p>

<p>"Maron and Teril," replied the guard, and then strode
off into the darkness.</p>

<p>"So long," said Astro, turning to face the two men
walking toward him. He would have to get rid of them.</p>

<p>"Hello, Maron, Teril," he called casually. "Everything
quiet?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," replied the shorter of the two, as they stopped
in front of Astro, "no trouble tonight."</p>

<p>"Well, there's trouble now!" growled Astro. He
brought up the blaster and cocked it. "Make one wrong
move, and you're dead little space birds! Get over there
and open that door!"</p>

<p>Stunned, both men turned to the door without a protest
and Astro took their guns. "Open up!" he growled.</p>

<p>The men slid the heavy bar back and pushed the door
open.</p>

<p>"Get inside!" ordered Astro. The two men stumbled
inside. Astro stepped to the door. "Tom! Major!"</p>

<p>There was a cry of joy from the blackness within and
Astro recognized Tom.</p>

<p>"Astro!" roared Connel, rushing up. "What in the
stars&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Can't talk now," said Astro. "Here. Take these blasters
and then tie these two up. Close the door, but leave
it open a crack. We can talk while I stay outside and
keep watch. If there isn't a guard out here, it might
mean trouble."</p>

<p>"Right," said Connel. He took the blasters, tossing
one over to Tom. "Blast it, I never felt anything so good
in my life!" He closed the door, leaving it open an inch.</p>

<p>"Why is Roger in the hospital?" asked Astro quickly.</p>

<p>Connel told him of the fight with the tyrannosaurus
and Roger's injury, ending with their capture by the
patrol.</p>

<p>"You know what's going on here, Major?" asked
Astro.</p>

<p>"I sure do," said Connel. "And the sooner we blast
them, the happier I'll be."</p>

<p>"One of us will have to escape and get back to the
<i>Polaris</i> to contact Commander Walters," said Astro.
"But they've got radar here as good as ours. That has to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>be put out of commission or they can blast any attacking
fleet."</p>

<p>"You're right," said Connel grimly, and turned back
into the room. "Tom!" he called.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom, coming up to the door.</p>

<p>"Since Astro and I speak Venusian&mdash;" said Connel,
and then added when Tom gasped, "Yes, I speak it
fluently, but I kept it a secret. That means you're the
one to go. Astro and I will have more of a chance here.
You escape and return to the <i>Polaris</i>. Contact Commander
Walters. Tell him everything that's happened.
We'll give you thirty-six hours to make it. At exactly
noon, day after tomorrow, we'll knock out their radar."</p>

<p>"But how, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Never mind. We'll figure out something. Just get
back to the <i>Polaris</i> and tell the Solar Guard to attack at
noon, day after tomorrow. If you don't and the fleet attacks
earlier, or later, they'll be wiped out."</p>

<p>"What about you, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"If you get back in time, we'll be all right. If not,
then this is good-by. We'll hold out as long as we can,
but that can't be forever. We're fighting smart, determined
men, Tom. And it's a fight to the finish. Now
hurry up and get into one of those uniforms."</p>

<p>While Tom turned back inside to put on the uniform,
Connel returned to Astro outside the door. "Think we
can do it, Astro?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why not, sir," replied the big cadet.</p>

<p>A moment later Tom returned, dressed in one of the
guard's green uniform and wearing a helmet. Carson
was with him, similarly clad. "Astro better show me the
way out of the base," said Tom. "Carson will stand
guard until he gets back."</p>

<p>"Good idea," said Connel. Tom and Carson slipped
out the door.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>"All set, Astro?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Yeah, there's only one thing wrong," replied the big
cadet.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"I don't know the way out of the base."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_15" id="CHAPTER_15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>


<p>"I can tell you the way out of the base."</p>

<p>Adjusting the plastic helmet over his head, Carson
stepped up close to Astro and Tom and spoke confidently.
"It's very simple."</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Tom. "I thought we'd have to go
fumbling around."</p>

<p>Carson pointed through the darkness. "Follow this
lane straight down until you come to a large repair
lock. There's a space freighter on the maintenance cradle
outside. You can't miss it. Turn left and follow a
trail to the base of the canyon wall. There are jungle
creepers and vines growing up the side and you can
climb them easily."</p>

<p>Tom nodded and repeated the directions, then turned
to Astro. "Maybe you'd better stay here, Astro. I can
make it alone."</p>

<p>"No." Connel spoke sharply from the doorway. "Astro
speaks Venusian. If you're stopped, he can speak for
you. You'd give yourself away."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said Tom. "I guess that is best.
Ready to go, Astro?"</p>

<p>"Ready," replied the big cadet.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Major," said Tom, reaching into the doorway
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>to shake hands with Connel. "I'll try my best."</p>

<p>"It's a matter of life and death, Tom." Connel's voice
was low and husky. "Not our lives, or the lives of a few
people, but the life and death of the Solar Alliance."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir." Tom turned to Astro and the two
cadets marched off quickly.</p>

<p>They had no difficulty finding the giant ship on the
cradles outside the repair shop and quickly turned toward
the base of the cliff. Twenty minutes later they
had left the center of activity and were close to the
canyon wall. They were congratulating themselves on
their luck in not being stopped or questioned when
suddenly they saw a guard ahead of them on sentry
duty.</p>

<p>"Ill take care of him," whispered Astro. "You hide
here in the shadows, and when I whistle, you start
climbing. Then I'll cover you from there until you get
to the top. Got it?"</p>

<p>"Right!" The two cadets shook hands briefly. Each
knew that there was no need to speak of their feelings.
"Take care of Roger," said Tom. "We don't know how
badly he's been injured."</p>

<p>"I'll see to him," said Astro. "Watch me now and wait
for my whistle." He turned away and then paused to
call back softly, "Spaceman's luck, Tom."</p>

<p>"Same to you, Astro," replied Tom, and then crouched
tensely in the shadows.</p>

<p>The big cadet walked casually toward the sentry,
who spotted him immediately and brought his gun up
sharply, calling a challenge in the Venusian tongue.</p>

<p>"A friend," replied Astro in the same dialect.</p>

<p>The sentry lowered the gun slightly. "What are you
doing out here?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Just taking a walk," said Astro. "Looking for something."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>"What?" asked the sentry.</p>

<p>"Trying to make a connection."</p>

<p>"A connection? What kind of connection?"</p>

<p>"This kind!" said Astro suddenly, chopping the side
of his hand down on the sentry's neck, between the
helmet and his uniform collar.</p>

<p>The sentry fell to the ground like a poleaxed steer
and lay still. Astro grinned, then turned and went whistling
off into the darkness. Twenty feet away Tom heard
the signal and hurried to the base of the cliff. He
grabbed a thick vine and pulled himself upward, hand
over hand. Halfway up he found a small ledge and
stopped to rest. Below him, he could see Astro hurrying
back toward the center of the base. The dim lights and
the distant hum of activity assured him that so far his
escape was unnoticed. He resumed his climb, and fifteen
minutes later the curly-haired cadet stood on the
canyon rim. After another short rest he turned and
plunged into the jungle.</p>

<p>Tom knew that as long as he kept the planet of
Earth over his right shoulder, while keeping the distant
star of Regulus ahead of him, he was traveling in the
right direction to Sinclair's plantation. He stopped to
check his bearings often, occasionally having to climb
a tree to see over the top of the jungle. He ignored the
threat of an attack by a jungle beast. For some reason
it did not present the danger it had when he had first
entered the jungle, seemingly years before. Under pressure,
the cadet had become skilled in jungle lore and
moved with amazing speed. He kept the blaster ready
to fire at the slightest movement, but fortunately during
the first night he encountered nothing more dangerous
than a few furry deerlike animals that scampered
behind him off the trail.</p>

<p>Morning broke across the jungle in a sudden burst of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>sunlight. The air was clear and surprisingly cool, and
Tom felt that he could make the Sinclair plantation by
nightfall if he continued pushing full speed ahead.</p>

<p>He stopped once for a quick meal of the last of the
synthetics that he had stuffed in his pocket from his
shoulder pack, and then continued in a steady, ground-eating
pace through the jungle. Late in the afternoon
he began to recognize signs of recent trail blazing, and
once he cut across the path Astro had made. He wondered
if the trail was one Astro had cut while he was
lost, or previously. He finally decided to go ahead on
his own, since he had managed to come this far without
the aid of any guide markers.</p>

<p>As the darkening shadows of night began to spread
over the jungle the young cadet began to worry. He
had been allowed thirty-six hours to make it back to
the <i>Polaris</i>, communicate with Commander Walters,
and tell him the position of the base, and Tom had to
allow time for the Solar Guard fleet to assemble and
blast off, so that it would arrive at the base at exactly
noon on the next day. He had to reach the Sinclair plantation
before nightfall or the fleet would never make it.</p>

<p>Suddenly to his left he heard a noisy crashing of
underbrush and the roar of a large beast. Tom hesitated.
He could hide; he could fight; or he could break
to his right and try to escape. The beast growled menacingly.
It had picked up his scent. Tom was sure it
was a large beast on the prowl for food, and he decided
that he could not waste time hiding, or risk being injured
in a battle with the jungle prowler. He quickly
broke to his right and raced through the jungle. Behind
him, the beast picked up the chase, the ground trembling
with its approach. It began to gain on him. Tom
was suddenly conscious of having lost his bearings. He
might be running away from the clearing!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p>Still he ran on, legs aching and lungs burning. He
charged through the underbrush that threatened any
moment to trip him. When he was almost at the point
of complete exhaustion, and ready to turn and face the
beast behind him, he saw something that renewed his
spirit and sent new strength through his body. Ahead
through the vines and creepers, the slender nose of the
<i>Polaris</i> was outlined against the twilight sky.</p>

<p>Disregarding the beast behind him, he plunged
through the last few feet of jungle undergrowth and
raced into the clearing around the Sinclair home. Behind
him, the beast suddenly stopped growling, and
when Tom reached the air lock of the <i>Polaris</i>, he saw
that the beast had turned back, reluctant to come out
of the protection of the jungle.</p>

<p>Tom pulled the air-lock port open and was about to
step inside when he heard a harsh voice coming from
the shadow of the port stabilizer.</p>

<p>"Just stop right where you are!"</p>

<p>Tom jerked around. Rex Sinclair stepped out of the
shadow, a paralo-ray gun in his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sinclair!" cried Tom, suddenly relieved. "Boy,
am I glad to see you!" He jumped to the ground. "Don't
you recognize me? Cadet Corbett!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/ill-171.png" width="310" height="500" alt="&quot;Mr. Sinclair!&quot; cried Tom, suddenly relieved" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Mr. Sinclair!&quot; cried Tom, suddenly relieved</span>
</div>

<p>"Yes, I recognize you," snarled Sinclair. "Get away
from that air lock or I'll blast you!"</p>

<p>Tom's face expressed the confusion he felt. "But, Mr.
Sinclair, you're making a mistake. I've got to get aboard
and warn&mdash;" He stopped. "What's the idea of holding a
paralo ray on me?"</p>

<p>"You're not warning anybody!" Sinclair waved the
gun menacingly. "Now get over to the house and walk
slowly with your hands in the air or I'll freeze you
solid!"</p>

<p>Stunned by this sudden turn of events, Tom turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>away from the air lock. "So you're one of them, too,"
said Tom. "No wonder we were caught in the jungle.
You knew we were looking for the base."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," snapped Sinclair. "Get into the
house and make it quick!"</p>

<p>The young cadet walked slowly toward the house. He
saw the charred remains of the burned outbuildings
and nodded. "So it was all an act, eh? You had your
buildings burned to throw us off the track. Small price
to pay to remain in the confidence of the Solar Guard."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" growled Sinclair.</p>

<p>"You might be able to shut me up, but it'll take a lot
more than a bunch of rabble rousers to shut up the
Solar Guard!"</p>

<p>"We'll see," snapped Sinclair.</p>

<p>They reached the house and Tom climbed the steps
slowly, hoping the planter would come close enough
for a sudden attack, but he was too careful. They
moved into the living room and Tom stopped in surprise.
George Hill and his wife were tied hand and foot
to two straight-backed chairs.</p>

<p>Tom gasped. "George! Mrs. Hill!"</p>

<p>George Hill strained against his bonds and mumbled
something through the gag in his mouth, but Tom
couldn't understand what he was trying to say. Mrs.
Hill just looked at the planter with wide, frightened
eyes. The cadet whirled around angrily. "Why, you
dirty little space rat!"</p>

<p>Sinclair didn't hesitate. He squeezed the trigger of
his paralo-ray gun and Tom stiffened into rigidity.</p>

<p>The planter dropped the ray gun into a chair and
leisurely began to tie the hands and feet of the immobilized
cadet.</p>

<p>"Since you can hear me, Corbett," said Sinclair, "and
since you are powerless to do anything about what I'm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>about to tell you, I'm going to give you a full explanation.
I owe it to you. You've really worked for it."</p>

<p>Unable to move a muscle, Tom nevertheless could
hear the planter clearly. He mentally chided himself at
his stupidity in allowing himself to be captured so easily.</p>

<p>Sinclair continued, "My original invitation to you and
your friends, to use my home as a base for your hunting
operations was sincere. I had no idea you were in any
way connected with the investigation the Solar Guard
was planning to make into the Nationalist movement."</p>

<p>Tom was completely bound now, and the planter
stepped back, picked up the ray gun, and flipping on
the neutralizer, released the cadet from the effects
of the ray charge. Tom shuddered involuntarily, his
nerves and muscles quivering as life suddenly flowed
into them again. He twisted at the bonds on his wrists,
and to his amazement found them slightly loose. He was
sure he could work his hands free, but decided to wait
for a better opportunity. He glanced at the clock on the
wall near by and saw that it was nine in the evening.
Only fifteen hours before the Solar Guard must attack!</p>

<p>Sinclair sat down casually in a chair and faced the
cadet. George and Mrs. Hill had stopped struggling
and were watching their employer.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about the bomb we found on
the <i>Polaris</i> on our trip to Venus?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I planned that little surprise myself, Corbett," said
Sinclair. "Unfortunately our agents on Earth bungled
it."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that was pretty stupid. There would
have been another man sent in Major Connel's place,
and we were warned that something big was in the
wind."</p>

<p>"Ah, quite so, Corbett," said Sinclair. "But the destruction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>of the <i>Polaris</i> would have caused no end of
speculation. There would have been an investigation
which would have temporarily removed the spotlight
from the Nationalist movement. That would have given
us ample time to complete our preparations for the attack."</p>

<p>"Then you knew," said Tom bitterly, "when Major
Connel, Roger, Astro, and I left here that we were going
to be captured."</p>

<p>"Well, that was one of the details of the final plan.
Personally, I hoped that you and your nosy major would
meet a more dramatic and permanent end in the jungle."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with us?" asked Tom,
glancing at George and his wife. "And what do Mr. and
Mrs. Hill have to do with your scheme?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately they discovered who I am, and of
course had to be taken care of. As to your eventual disposition,
I haven't had time to think about that."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better start thinking," said Tom. "And
you'd better do a good job when you attack the Solar
Guard. Perhaps you don't know it, Sinclair, but the
whole pattern of the Solar Guard is one of defense. We
do not invite attack, but are prepared for it. And we
have the power to counterattack!"</p>

<p>"When we get through with your Solar Guard, Corbett,"
sneered Sinclair, "there won't be anything left
but smoldering heaps of junk and the dead bodies of
stupid men!"</p>

<p>The buzz of a teleceiver suddenly sounded in another
part of the house and Sinclair left the room quickly.
When he was sure the planter was out of earshot, Tom
turned to George and whispered, "I think I can work
my hands loose. Where can I find a ray gun?" George
began to mumble frantically but Tom couldn't understand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>him, and the sound of returning footsteps silenced
Hill. The planter strode back into the room,
hurriedly putting on the green uniform of the Nationalists.
"I've just received word of a speed-up in the
preparations for our attack," he said. "Soon, Corbett&mdash;soon
you will see what will happen to the Solar Guard!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_16" id="CHAPTER_16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>


<p>"Bring that dirty little space crawler in here!"</p>

<p>Captain Strong had never seen Commander Walters
so angry. The cords stood out in his neck and his face
was red with fury as he paced up and down the Solar
Guard office in Venusport. "A spy," he roared. "A spy
right in the heart of our organization!" He shook his
head.</p>

<p>The door opened and two burly Solar Guardsmen
entered, saluted, and turned to flank the doorway, hands
on their paralo-ray pistols. The private secretary of E.
Philips James shuffled in slowly, followed by two more
guards. Walters stepped up to the thin, intense young
man and glared at him. "If I had my way, I'd send you
out to the deepest part of space and leave you there!"</p>

<p>The man bit his lip but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Where is your secret base?" demanded Walters.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the secretary nervously.</p>

<p>"Who told you to intercept this message from Mercury?"
Walters tapped a paper on his desk. "Who gave
you your orders?"</p>

<p>"I receive orders on an audioceiver in my home," answered
the man, a slight quaver in his voice. "I have
never seen my superior."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<p>"And you followed the Nationalist movement blindly,
doing whatever they told you, without question, is
that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>!" roared Walters.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," corrected the secretary.</p>

<p>"Who told you to forge those orders for priority seats
on the <i>Venus Lark</i>?"</p>

<p>"My superior," said the man.</p>

<p>"How did you know Major Connel was coming here
to investigate the Nationalists?"</p>

<p>"I read the decoded message sent to the Solar Delegate,
Mr. James."</p>

<p>"Who told you to send men to bomb the <i>Polaris</i>?"</p>

<p>"My superior," said the man.</p>

<p>"Your superior&mdash;your superior!" Walters' voice was
edged with contempt. "What else has your superior told
you to do?"</p>

<p>"A great many things," said the young man simply.</p>

<p>Walters studied the thin face and then turned to
Captain Strong. "There's only one thing to do, Steve.
There's no telling how many of these rats are inside our
organization. Relieve every civilian in any position of
trust and put in our own man. I'll make a public teleceiver
broadcast in half an hour. I'm declaring martial
law."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Strong grimly.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't been in the code room when this message
from Mercury came in, we would never have
known the Nationalists were trying to get the Mercurians
to join them in their attack on us until it was too
late. It's the only break we've had, so far, learning that
the Mercurians are still decent, loyal Solar citizens. I
hate to think of what would have happened if they
hadn't warned us."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>"He very nearly got away with it, sir," said Strong.
"If I hadn't heard the signal for a top-secret message
come through on the coding machine, I never would
have suspected him. He tried to hide it in his tunic. He
also confessed to trying to kidnap the cadets when he
heard me tell them that a cab would be waiting for
them."</p>

<p>"Well, we know now," said Walters. He turned to one
of the guardsmen. "Sergeant, I'm holding you personally
responsible for this man."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," said the guard, stepping toward the
secretary, but Walters stopped him and addressed the
man.</p>

<p>"I'll give you one last chance to tell me where your
base is and how many ships you have," he said.</p>

<p>The secretary looked down at his feet and mumbled,
"I don't know where the base is, and I don't know how
many ships there are."</p>

<p>"Then what does this list we found in your tunic
mean?" snapped Strong. "These are the names of ships
that have been lost in space."</p>

<p>"I don't know. That list was sent to me over the audioceiver
by my superior. I was to relay it to Mercury
should they accept our proposal to join forces
against&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

<p>"Get him out of my sight!" barked Walters.</p>

<p>The guards closed in around the little man and he
slowly shuffled out of the office.</p>

<p>"I wonder how many more there are like him in our
organization, Steve?" The commander had turned to
the window and was staring out blindly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," replied Strong. "But I think we'd
better be prepared for trouble."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Walters, turning to the Solar Guard
captain. "What do you suggest?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>"Since we don't know how many ships they have,
where their base is, or when they plan to attack, I suggest
putting the Venus squadrons in defense pattern A.
Meanwhile, call in three additional squadrons from
Mars, Earth, and Luna. That way, we can at least be assured
of an even fight."</p>

<p>"But we don't know if they'll attack here on Venus.
Suppose we weaken Earth's fleet and they attack
there?" Walters paused, looking troubled. Then he
sighed. "I guess you're right. Put the plan into effect
immediately. It's the only thing we can do."</p>

<p>At exactly midnight every teleceiver on Venus was
suddenly blacked out for a moment and then came into
focus again to reveal the grim features of Commander
Walters.</p>

<p>In homes, restaurants, theaters, arriving and departing
space liners, in every public and private gathering
place, the citizens of Venus heard the announcement.</p>

<p>"As commander in chief of the Solar Guard, I hereby
place the entire planet of Venus under martial law. All
public laws are suspended until further notice. All public
officials are hereby relieved of their authority. A ten
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> until six <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> curfew will go into effect immediately.
Anyone caught on the streets between these
hours will be arrested. An attack is expected on the
city of Venusport, as well as other Venusian cities, momentarily.
Follow established routine for such an occurrence.
Obey officers and enlisted men of the Solar Guard
who are here on Venus to protect you and your property.
That is all!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the living room of Sinclair's house Tom waited impatiently
for the sound of Sinclair's yacht taking off before
attempting to free himself from the rope on his
wrists. But when a half-hour had passed with no sound
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>from outside, he decided not to waste any more time.</p>

<p>Relaxing completely, the curly-haired cadet began
working his wrists back and forth in the loop of rope.
It was slow, painful work, and in no time the skin was
rubbed raw. George and Mrs. Hill watched him, wide-eyed.
They saw the skin of his wrists gradually turn
pink, then red, as the cadet pulled and pushed at the
rope. A half-hour had passed before he felt the rope
slipping down over the widest part of his hand. Slowly,
so as not to lose the precious advantage, he pulled with
all his strength, unmindful of the pain. He heard a
sharp gasp from Mrs. Hill and then felt the rope become
damp. His wrists were bleeding. But at the same
time he felt the rope slipping over his hands. He gave
a quick tug and the rope slipped off and dropped to the
floor, a bloody tangle. He spun around and untied the
foreman and his wife quickly, removing the gags from
their mouths gently.</p>

<p>"Your wrists!" cried Mrs. Hill.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about them, ma'am," said Tom. He
looked at Hill. "How long have you been tied up?"</p>

<p>"Just about an hour before you came," answered the
foreman. "I found Sinclair in front of a teleceiver in his
room. It's in a secret panel and I didn't know it was
there. I waited and heard him talking to someone in
Venusian. But he spotted me and pulled a ray gun."</p>

<p>"Do you know where he's gone?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"No, but I sure wish I did!" said the burly foreman
stoutly. "I have something to settle with him."</p>

<p>"That'll have to wait until the Solar Guard is finished
with him. Come on!" Tom started toward the door.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Hill.</p>

<p>"To the <i>Polaris</i>! I've got to warn the Solar Guard of
their plans. They're going to attack the Venusport garrison
and take over Venus!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>
<p>"By the stars!" gasped Mrs. Hill. "Here I've been
feeding that man all these years and didn't know I was
contributing to a revolution!"</p>

<p>Tom was out of the door and running toward the
<i>Polaris</i> before she had finished talking. George followed
right behind him.</p>

<p>As the cadet raced across the dark clearing one hope
filled his mind&mdash;that the <i>Polaris</i> would be in the same
condition in which they had left it.</p>

<p>The port was still open where Sinclair had caught
him and he climbed inside the giant ship quickly. As
soon as he entered, he snapped on the emergency lights
and searched the ship carefully. After examining every
compartment, and satisfied that there was no one
aboard, he made his way back to the radar bridge.
There, he saw immediately why Sinclair had felt free
to leave the ship. All radar and communications equipment
had been completely smashed.</p>

<p>The young cadet returned to the control deck and
called down to George Hill, waiting in the air lock.
"George! Get Mrs. Hill aboard quickly. We're blasting
off!"</p>

<p>"Blasting off?" the foreman called back. "But I
thought you were going to contact Venusport!"</p>

<p>"I can't," replied Tom. "Sinclair has smashed the
communications and the radar. We'll have to take our
information to Venusport in person. I only hope he's
left the rockets and atomic motors alone."</p>

<p>"How about using the teleceiver in the house?" asked
the foreman, climbing up to the control deck.</p>

<p>"Can't take a chance," said Tom. "This is top secret.
They might have the teleceiver tapped."</p>

<p>"Do you know how to handle this ship alone?" asked
George, glancing around at the great control board. "I
don't know anything about a ship this size."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>
<p>"I can handle it," said Tom. "Get Mrs. Hill aboard!"</p>

<p>"Here I am, Tommy," said Mrs. Hill, climbing up
into the control deck. "I have some bandages and salve
for your wrists."</p>

<p>"There's no time, Mrs. Hill," said Tom. "We've got
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" she interrupted firmly. "You just give me
your hands. It'll take only a minute!"</p>

<p>Tom reluctantly held out his wrists and Mrs. Hill
expertly applied the salve and bandaged the cadet's
raw wrists. Admittedly feeling better, Tom turned to
the master switch and found it missing. For a second
panic seized him, until he remembered that Major Connel
had hidden it. He felt under the pilot's chair and
breathed easier, pulling out the vital instrument.</p>

<p>"Better get into acceleration chairs," said Tom, strapping
himself into his seat. "This might be a rough take-off."</p>

<p>"Watch yourself, Tom," cautioned George. "We
aren't afraid for ourselves, but you've got to get to Venusport!"</p>

<p>"If he's left the power deck alone, everything will
be O.K."</p>

<p>The young cadet stretched out a trembling hand and
switched on the automatic firing control. Then, crossing
his fingers, he flipped on the main generator and
breathed easier as the steady hum surged through the
ship. He thought briefly of Astro and Roger, wishing his
two unit mates were at their stations, and then switched
on the power feed to the energizing pumps. There was
a second's wait as the pressure began to build, and he
watched the indicator over his head on the control
panel carefully. When it had reached the proper level,
he switched in the reactant feed, giving it full D-12
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>rate. He glanced at the astral chronometer over his
head automatically and noted the time.</p>

<p>"Stand by!" he called. "Blast off minus five&mdash;four&mdash;three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;<i>zero</i>!"</p>

<p>He threw the master switch and a roaring burst of
power poured into the main tubes. The ship bucked
slightly, raised itself from the ground slowly, and then
suddenly shot upward. In less than a minute the <i>Polaris</i>
had cleared atmosphere and Tom turned on the artificial-gravity
generators. He made a quick computation
on the planetary calculator, fired the port steering rockets,
and sent the ship in a long arching course for Venusport.
Then, unstrapping himself, he turned to see
how Mr. and Mrs. Hill had taken the blast-off.</p>

<p>The foreman and his wife were shaking their heads,
still in acceleration shock, and Tom helped them out of
their cushions.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! Do you boys have to go through this all the
time?" Mrs. Hill asked. "It's a wonder to me how a human
body can take it."</p>

<p>"I feel pretty much the same way," muttered George.</p>

<p>"A cup of hot tea will fix you up fine," Tom reassured
them, and leaving the ship on automatic control, he
went into the small galley off the control deck and
brewed three cups of tea. In a few moments the elderly
couple felt better, and Tom told them of the Nationalists'
base and Connel's plan to wreck the radar station
at noon the next day. Both Mr. and Mrs. Hill were
shocked at the scope of the Nationalists' plan.</p>

<p>"Well, they bit off more than they could chew when
they decided to buck the Solar Guard," asserted Tom.
"When Commander Walters gets finished with them,
Sinclair and the rest won't have anything left but memories!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>"Tell me something, Tom," said George, looking at
the control panel thoughtfully. "Have you figured out
how you're going to land this ship alone and with no
radar?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to use the seat of my pants." Tom smiled,
and turned back to his seat. George and his wife looked
at each other and quickly strapped themselves into
their acceleration cushions.</p>

<p>A few moments later Tom began braking the ship
with the nose rockets. It made a slow-climbing arc over
the spaceport and then settled slowly, tailfirst. The
stern teleceiver was out of order, and the young cadet
had to rely entirely on "feel," to get the <i>Polaris</i> in safely.
He had calculated his rate of fall, the gravity of Venus,
and the power of the rockets, and was dropping at a
predetermined rate. At the critical point he increased
power on the drive rockets, continuing to fall slowly
until he felt the jarring bump of the directional fins
touching the ground.</p>

<p>"Touchdown!" he roared triumphantly.</p>

<p>He closed the master switch and turned to look at
the smiling faces of Mr. and Mrs. Hill.</p>

<p>"That was fine, Tom," said George, "but I don't want
to do it again."</p>

<p>"Don't be a scaredy cat, George Hill!" taunted Mrs.
Hill. "Tom handles this ship as if he were born on it."</p>

<p>Tom grinned. "We'd better hurry up. There must be
something going on. There aren't any lights on here
at the spaceport and all the administration buildings
are dark."</p>

<p>He hurried to the air lock and swung it open, jumping
lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>"Halt!" growled a rough voice. "Get your hands in
the air and stay right where you are!"</p>

<p>Puzzled, Tom did as he was told, announcing, "I'm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>Space Cadet Tom Corbett, <i>Polaris</i> unit. I request immediate
transportation to Commander Walters. I have
important information for him."</p>

<p>He was momentarily blinded by the glare of a ring
of lights around him, and when he finally could see, he
found himself in the middle of a squad of Solar Guardsmen
in battle dress.</p>

<p>"What's the password?" asked a tough sergeant
whose shock rifle was aimed right at Tom's midsection.</p>

<p>"Juggernaut!" replied Tom quietly.</p>

<p>The word sent the sergeant into a frenzy of action.
"Peters, Smith, get the jet car around here!"</p>

<p>"What's up, Sergeant?" asked Tom. "Why is everything
so dark?"</p>

<p>"Martial law!" replied the guardsman. "Curfew from
ten until six."</p>

<p>"Whew!" gasped Tom. "It looks as if I just made it!"</p>

<p>As George and Mrs. Hill climbed out of the air lock,
a jet car raced up and skidded to a stop in front of them.
A moment later Tom and the couple, accompanied by
two of the guardsmen, were speeding through the dark
and empty streets of Venusport. The car was stopped
once at a mid-town check point, and Tom had to repeat
the password. They picked up another jet car, full of
guardsmen as escorts, and with the echo of the exhausts
roaring in the empty avenues, they sped to central Solar
Guard headquarters.</p>

<p>Tom had never seen so many enlisted guardsmen in
one spot before except on a parade ground. And he
noted with a tinge of excitement that each man was
in battle dress. Arriving at headquarters, they were
whisked to the top floor of the building and ushered
into Commander Walters' office. The commander smiled
broadly as the young cadet stepped to the front of his
desk and saluted smartly.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>"Cadet Corbett reporting, sir," he said.</p>

<p>In a moment the office was filled with men; E. Philips
James, the Solar Delegate, Captain Strong, fleet commanders,
and officers of the line.</p>

<p>"Make your report, Cadet Corbett," said Walters.</p>

<p>Tom spoke quickly and precisely, giving full details
on the location of the base, the approximate number
of fighting ships, the armament of each, the location of
supply dumps, and finally of Major Connel's plan to
sabotage the radar at noon the following day. Then,
one by one, each official asked him questions pertinent
to their tasks. Fleet commanders asked about the ships'
speed, size, armor; Strong inquired about the stores and
supporting lines of supply; Walters asked for the names
of all people connected with the movement. All of these
questions Tom answered as well as he could.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Walters, "thanks to Corbett
and the others on this mission, we have all the information
we need to counter the Nationalists. I propose to
follow Major Connel's plan and attack the base at noon
tomorrow. Squadrons A and B will approach from the
south and east at exactly noon. Squadrons C, D, and
E will come in from the north and west as a second
wave at 1202. The rest of the fleet will go in from above
at 1205. Supporting squadrons are now on their way
from Earth and Mars. Blast off at six hundred hours.
Spaceman's luck!"</p>

<p>"Good work, Tom," said Strong, when the conference
broke up.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom. "But I can't help worrying about
Roger and Astro and Major Connel. What's going to
happen to them, sir?"</p>

<p>Strong hesitated. "I don't know, Tom. I really don't
know."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_17" id="CHAPTER_17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>


<p>"What time is it, Astro?"</p>

<p>"Exactly eleven o'clock, sir."</p>

<p>"All set?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You know what to do. Move out!"</p>

<p>Astro and Major Connel were crouched behind a pile
of fuel drums piled near the communications and radar
building in the heart of the Nationalists' base. Above
them, the gigantic tree used as the radar tower rose
straight into the Venusian morning sky.</p>

<p>After helping Tom to escape, Astro had returned to
the prison building for Connel and was surprised to find
the place surrounded by green-clad Nationalist guards.
Rather than attempt to release Connel then, Astro hid
and waited for the time set to wreck the radar communications
of the enemy. During the second day, he
had successfully eluded the many patrols looking for
him. Once from a hiding place he overheard one of the
men mention Connel. He took a daring chance and approached
the patrol openly. Speaking the Venusian dialect,
he learned that Connel had escaped. That news
sent the cadet on a different game of hide-and-seek as
he prowled around the base searching for the Solar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>Guard officer. He had found him hiding near the radar
tower, and they spent the night close to the communications
building waiting for the time to strike.</p>

<p>Their plan was simple. Astro would enter the building
from the front, while Connel would enter from the
rear. Astro would draw attention to himself, and while
the guards inside the building were busy dealing with
him, Connel would come upon them from behind,
knock them out of action, and then destroy the radar
equipment.</p>

<p>The two spacemen gave no thought to their own
safety. They were concerned only with accomplishing
their objective. Having no way of knowing whether
Tom had made it back to Venusport or whether their
destruction of the communications center would be of
any value, they nevertheless had to proceed on the assumption
that Tom had gotten through.</p>

<p>Astro crawled behind the drums and stopped twenty
feet from the door to wait for several Nationalist officers
to leave. They finally got into a jet car and roared
away. Astro nodded to the major waiting to edge
around to the rear and then headed for the main entrance.</p>

<p>Connel saw Astro making his way to the front door
and hurried around to complete his part of the mission.
He waited exactly three minutes, gripped his shock
rifle firmly, and then crossed over to the rear of the
building and stepped inside.</p>

<p>Once inside, the major found it difficult to keep from
bursting into laughter. The large ground-floor room
was a frenzy of brawling, yelling, shouting Nationalist
guards trying to capture the giant cadet. Astro was
standing in the middle of the floor, swinging his great
hamlike fists methodically, mowing down the guards
like tenpins. Two of them were on his back, trying to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>choke him, while others crowded in from all sides. But
they could not bring the cadet down. Astro saw Connel,
shook himself, and stood free.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" roared Connel. "The first one of you
green monkeys that makes a move will have his teeth
knocked out! Now line up over there against the wall&mdash;and
I mean fast!"</p>

<p>The sudden attack from the rear startled the Nationalist
guards, and they milled around in confusion.
There was no confusion, however, when Connel fired
a blast over their heads. Astro grabbed a paralo-ray gun
and opened up on the guards. A second later the squad
of Nationalists were frozen in their tracks.</p>

<p>Once the men were no further danger to them, Connel
and Astro locked the front and rear doors and then
raced up the stairs that led to the main radar and communications
rooms on the second floor.</p>

<p>"You start at that end of the hall, I'll start here!"
shouted Connel. "Smash everything you see!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir." Astro waved his hand and charged
down the hall. He exploded into a room, firing rapidly,
and an electronics engineer froze in a startled pose in
front of his worktable. The big cadet gleefully swung a
heavy chair across the table of delicate electronic instruments,
and smashed shelves of vital parts, pausing
only long enough to see if he had left anything unbroken.
He rushed out into the hall again. At the other
end he heard Connel in action in another room. Astro
grinned. It sounded as if the major was having a good
time. "Well," thought the big cadet, "I'm not having
such a bad time myself!"</p>

<p>The next room he invaded contained the radar-control
panel, and the big cadet howled with glee as he
smashed the butt of his paralo-ray gun into the delicate
vacuum tubes, and ripped wires and circuits loose.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped, conscious of someone behind
him. He spun around, finger starting to squeeze the
trigger of his gun, and then caught himself just in time.
Major Connel was leaning against the doorjamb, a wide
grin on his face.</p>

<p>"How're you doing?" he drawled.</p>

<p>"Not bad," said Astro casually. "Be a lot of work here,
fixing these things, eh?" He grinned.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>Astro looked at his watch. "Twenty to twelve."</p>

<p>"We'd better clear out of here and head for the jungle."</p>

<p>Astro hesitated. "You know, sir, I've been thinking."</p>

<p>"If you have an idea, spill it," said the major.</p>

<p>"How about releasing the prisoners, taking over a
ship, and blasting off?"</p>

<p>"And have the Solar Guard fleet blast us out of the
skies? No, sir! Come on, we've got to get moving!"</p>

<p>"We could still try to release Carson and the others,"
said Astro stoutly.</p>

<p>"We can try all right, but I don't think we'll be very
successful."</p>

<p>The two spacemen returned to the first floor of the
building and headed for the rear door without so much
as a look at the line of frozen guards along the wall.
Once outside, they skirted the edge of the building,
staying close to the hedge, and then struck out boldly
across the canyon floor toward the prison building.
They were surprised to see that their smashing attack
had gone unnoticed, and Connel reasoned that the constant
roar of activity in the canyon had covered the
sounds of their raid.</p>

<p>"We'll have to hurry, sir," said Astro as they turned
into the lane leading to the prison. "Ten minutes to
twelve."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>"It's no good, Astro," said Connel, suddenly pulling
the cadet back and pointing to the building. "Look at
all the guards&mdash;at least a dozen of them."</p>

<p>Astro waited a second before saying grimly, "We
could try, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't be a pigheaded idiot!" roared Connel. "Nothing
will happen to those men now, and in five minutes
there'll be so much confusion around here that we'll be
able to walk over and open the door without firing a
shot!"</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an explosive roar behind them
and they spun around. On the opposite side of the canyon
three rocket ships were hurtling spaceward.</p>

<p>"They must have spotted our fleet coming in," said
Connel, a puzzled frown on his face.</p>

<p>"But how could they?" asked Astro. "We knocked out
their radar!"</p>

<p>Connel slammed his fist into the palm of his hand.
"By the stars, Astro, we forgot about their monitoring
spaceship above the tower! When we knocked out the
main station here in the canyon, it took over and
warned the base of the attack!"</p>

<p>From all sides the canyon reverberated with the roaring
blasts of the Nationalist fleet blasting off. Around
them, the green-clad rebels were running to their defense
posts. Officers shouted frantic orders and workers
dropped tools to pick up guns. The building that held
Carson and the other planters was suddenly left alone
as the guards hurried to ships and battle stations.</p>

<p>Connel counted the number of ships blasting off and
smiled. "They don't stand a chance! They're sending up
only two heavy cruisers, four destroyers, and about
twenty scouts. The Solar Guard fleet will blast them
into space dust."</p>

<p>Astro jumped up and started to run.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hey, Astro! Where are you going?" shouted Connel.</p>

<p>"To find Roger!" Astro shouted in reply. "I'll meet
you back here!"</p>

<p>"Right!" shouted Connel, settling back into concealment.
There was no need to release the planters in the
guardhouse now. Connel was satisfied that in a few moments
the rebellion against the Solar Alliance would be
defeated. He smiled in prospect of seeing a good fight.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Bandit at three o'clock&mdash;range twenty miles!"
Aboard the command ship of the first group of attacking
Solar Guard squadrons, Captain Strong stood in the
middle of the control deck and watched the outline of
an approaching Nationalist cruiser on the radar scanner.
The voice of the range finder droned over the ship's
intercom.</p>

<p>"Change course three degrees starboard, one degree
down on ecliptic plane," ordered Strong calmly.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied Tom at the controls.</p>

<p>"Main battery, stand by to fire." Strong watched the
enemy ship closely.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" came the answer over the intercom.</p>

<p>"Approaching target!" called the range finder. "Closing
to fifty thousand yards&mdash;forty thousand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Pleiades</i> and <i>Regulus</i>," Strong called the other two
ships of his squadron. "Cut in on port and starboard
flanks. Squadron B, stand by!"</p>

<p>Abrupt acknowledgment came over the audioceiver
as the cruisers deployed for the attack.</p>

<p>"Twenty-three thousand yards, holding course." The
range-finder's voice was a steady monotone.</p>

<p>"Stand by to fire!" snapped Strong.</p>

<p>"Two bandits at nine o'clock on level plane of ecliptic!"
came the warning from the radar bridge.</p>

<p>Before Strong could issue an order countering the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>enemy move, the voice of the commander of the <i>Pleiades</i>
came in over the audioceiver, "Our meat, Strong,
you take care of the big baby!"</p>

<p>On the scanner screen Strong saw the trails of two
space torpedoes erupt from the side of the <i>Pleiades</i>,
followed immediately by two more from its flanking
ship, the <i>Regulus</i>. The four missiles hurtled toward the
two enemy destroyers, and a second later two brilliant
flashes of light appeared on the scanner. Direct hits on
the two destroyers!</p>

<p>"Range&mdash;ten thousand feet," came the calm voice
over the intercom, reminding Strong of the enemy
cruiser.</p>

<p>"Arm war heads!" snapped Strong over the intercom,
and, on the gun deck, men twirled the delicate fuses
on the noses of the space torpedoes and stepped
back.</p>

<p>"On target!" called the range finder.</p>

<p>"Full salvo&mdash;fire!" called Strong, and turned to Tom
quickly. "Ninety-degree turn&mdash;five degrees up!"</p>

<p>The Solar Guard cruiser quivered under the recoil
of the salvo and then bucked under the sudden change
of course to elude the torpedoes fired by the enemy a
split second later.</p>

<p>As the Solar Guard cruiser roared up in a long arc,
eluding the enemy torpedoes, the Nationalist ship maneuvered
frantically to evade the salvo of war heads,
but Strong had fired a deadly pattern. In a few seconds
the enemy ship was reduced to space junk.</p>

<p>Concentrating on the control panel, Tom had been
too busy maneuvering the giant ship to see the entire
engagement, but he heard the loud exulting cries of the
gun crew over the intercom. He looked up at Strong,
and the Solar Guard captain winked. "One down!"</p>

<p>"Here come squadrons C, D, and E, sir," said Tom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>indicating the radar. "Right on time." He glanced at the
astral chronometer over his head. "Two minutes after
twelve."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look as if we'll need them, Tom," said
Strong. "The Nationalists got only two cruisers and four
destroyers off the ground. We've already knocked out
one of their cruisers and two destroyers, and Squadron
B is taking on the second cruiser and its destroyer escorts
now!" He turned to the radar scanner and saw the
white evenly spaced blips that represented Squadron B
enveloping the three enemy ships. The bulky converted
cruiser was maneuvering frantically to get away. But
there was no escape. In a perfectly co-ordinated action
the Solar Guard ships fired their space torpedoes simultaneously.
The three Nationalist ships exploded in a
deadly flash of fire.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p><p>"Don't tell me that's all they've got!" exclaimed
Strong. "Why, we still have the rest of the fleet coming
in at 1205!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom froze in his seat. Before him on the
radar scanner he saw a new cluster of white blips,
seemingly coming from nowhere. They were enemy
ships, hurtling spaceward to meet the Solar Guard fleet.
"Captain Strong! Look! More of them. From secret
ramps in the jungle!"</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" roared the Solar Guard
captain. "Attention! Attention! All ships&mdash;all ships!" he
called into the fleet intercom. "This is Strong aboard
command ship. Bandit formation closing fast. Regroup!
Take tight defensive pattern!"</p>

<p>As the Solar Guard squadrons deployed to meet this
new attack, Tom felt a chill run down his spine. The
mass of ships blasting to meet them outnumbered them
by almost three to one. And there were more ships
blasting off from the secret ramps in the jungle! He had
led the Solar Guard into a trap!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_18" id="CHAPTER_18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>


<p>"Fire at will! Fire at will!"</p>

<p>Aboard the command ship, Captain Strong roared
the order to the rest of the fleet, and the individual ship
commanders of the Solar Guard vessels broke formation
and rocketed into the mass of Nationalist ships, firing
salvo after salvo of space torpedoes. But it was a losing
battle. Time and again, Strong and Tom saw Solar
Guard ships hemmed in by three and four Nationalists'
vessels, then blasted into oblivion.</p>

<p>Strong had ordered Tom to maneuver the command
ship at will, seeking targets, yet still keeping from being
a target, and the young cadet had guided the powerful
ship through a series of maneuvers that had even surprised
the experienced Solar Guard officer.</p>

<p>"Where's the rest of the fleet?" roared Strong. "Why
aren't they here yet?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," replied Tom, "but if they don't
show up soon, there won't be much left to save!"</p>

<p>"Bandits dead ahead," droned the voice from the radar
bridge calmly, "trying to envelop us."</p>

<p>Tom's hand shot out for the intercom to relay orders
to the power deck and glanced quickly at the scanner.
He almost cheered. "Steve&mdash;I mean, Captain Strong.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>The rest of the fleet! It's coming in! Attacking from top-side!"</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna, you're right!" yelled the
young Solar Guard captain, as he saw the white blips on
the scanner screen. "O.K., it's time to stop running and
fight!"</p>

<p>The Solar Guard reinforcements swooped down on
the fighting ships with dazzling speed, and the sky over
the jungle belt of Venus base was so thick with zooming,
firing, maneuvering ships that observers on the
ground couldn't tell one ship from another. For an hour
the battle raged. During the seesawing back and forth
it seemed as if all ships must be blasted into space junk.
Finally the superior maneuvering and over-all spacemanship
of the Solar Guard vessels began to count
heavily, and the Nationalist ships began to plunge into
the jungle or drift helplessly out into space. Reforming,
the Solar Guard ships encircled the enemy in a deadly
englobement pattern, and wheeling in great co-ordinated
arcs through space, sent combined volleys of torpedoes
crashing into the enemy ships. The space battle
was over, a complete Solar Guard victory.</p>

<p>Strong called to the remaining ships of his fleet,
"Take formation K. Land and attack the enemy base
according to prearranged order. The enemy fleet is destroyed,
but we still have a big job to do."</p>

<p>"What happens now, sir?" asked Tom, relaxing for
the first time since the space battle had begun.</p>

<p>"We try to destroy their base and put an end to this
rebellion as quickly as possible," replied Strong coldly.</p>

<p>One by one, the ships of the Solar Guard fleet landed
around the rim of the canyon base. Troop carriers, that
had stood off while the space battle raged, disgorged
hundreds of tough Solar Guard Marines, each carrying
shock rifles, paralo-ray pistols, and small narco grenades
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>that would put an enemy to sleep in five seconds. A
half-hour later, after the last Nationalist ship had been
blasted out of the skies, the rim of the canyon was alive
with Solar Guardsmen waiting to go into action. Many
had comrades in the Solar Guard ships lost in the space
fight and they were eager to avenge their friends.</p>

<p>"How many ships did we lose, sir?" asked Tom, after
the squadron commanders had made their reports to
Captain Strong.</p>

<p>"Forty," said Strong grimly. "But the entire Nationalist
fleet was wiped out. Thank the universe that their
radar was knocked out, or we would have been completely
wiped out."</p>

<p>"Thank Astro and Major Connel for that, sir," said
Tom with the first smile on his face in days. "I knew
none of those green jokers could stop those two!"</p>

<p>"I've got to report to Commander Walters and the
Solar Alliance, Tom. You take a squad of men and move
out. Your job is to find Astro, Roger, and Major Connel."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir!" said Tom happily.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Down in the canyon, Major Connel had waited as
long as he dared for Astro to return with news of Roger.
From his position, the tough spaceman could not tell
how the gigantic space battle had ended until he saw
the Solar Guard troop carriers land on the rim of the
canyon above. Satisfied, he decided that it was time to
move.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">The Solar Guard troops landed on the rim of the canyon</span>
</div>

<p>He stood up, careful not to expose himself, since
fighting had broken out among the workers. Every
street, shop, and corner would bring dangers, and having
stayed alive this far, Connel wanted to reach the
Solar Guard forces and continue the fight alongside his
friends. Astro was nowhere in sight when the major
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>moved cautiously down a side alley, and he was beginning
to think that Astro had not escaped from the base
with Roger, when he saw the big cadet suddenly appear
around a corner running as hard as he could. A
few seconds later three green-clad Nationalist guards
rounded the corner and pounded after him.</p>

<p>Astro saw Connel and ducked behind an overturned
jet car, yelling, "I'm unarmed! Nail them, Major!"</p>

<p>In a flash Connel dropped to the pavement, and firing
from a kneeling position, cut the Nationalists down expertly.
When the last of the enemy was frozen, Connel
rushed to Astro's side.</p>

<p>"What about Roger?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't reach him," replied Astro. "The sick bay's
in the main administration building and that's so well
guarded it would take a full company to break in."</p>

<p>Connel nodded grimly. "Well, the best thing for us
to do is get more men and then tackle it."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Astro. "I think we'd better head for
the canyon walls on the west. The Marines are pouring
down that side."</p>

<p>"Let's go," grunted the major, and led the way down
the narrow lane. But when they reached the open area
beyond the repair shops they saw that the Nationalist
guards had thrown up barriers in the streets and were
preparing defenses against frontal assault.</p>

<p>"Maybe we'd better stay where we are, sir," the big
cadet said, after scanning the Nationalist defenses.
"We'd never be able to get through now."</p>

<p>"Ummmh," mused Connel. "You're right. Maybe we
can be of more use striking behind the lines."</p>

<p>Astro grinned. "That's just what I was thinking, sir."
He pointed to a near-by barrier set up in the middle of
the street. "We could pick off the men behind that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look out!" roared Connel. Behind them, five Nationalist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>guards had suddenly appeared. But they were
more surprised than Astro and Connel, and the big
cadet took advantage of it by charging right into
them.</p>

<p>It was a short but vicious fight. There was no time to
aim or fire a paralo-ray gun. It was a matter of bare
knuckles and feet and knees and shoulders. One by one,
the green-clad men were laid low, and finally, Connel,
out of breath, turned to grin at Astro.</p>

<p>"Feel better," he gasped, "than I've felt in weeks!"</p>

<p>Astro grinned. One of Connel's front teeth was missing.
Astro leaned against the wall and pointed to the
canyon wall where the columns of Solar Guard Marines
were making their way down into the base under heavy
covering fire from above. "Won't be long now!"</p>

<p>"Come on," said Connel. "They'll probably send
scouts out ahead of those columns and we can make
contact with them over there." He pointed toward a
high tangle of barbed wire set up in the middle of
the near-by street. Astro nodded, and exchanging his
broken ray gun for one belonging to a fallen Nationalist,
raced to the edge of the barrier with the major.
They crouched and waited for the first contact by the
Marines.</p>

<p>"They shouldn't be too long now," said Connel.</p>

<p>"No more than a minute, sir," said Astro, pointing to
a running figure darting from one protective position to
another.</p>

<p>"You, there!" shouted a familiar voice. "Behind that
barrier!"</p>

<p>Astro glanced at Connel. "Major, that sounds like&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Come out with your hands in the air and nothing
will happen to you!" the voice called again.</p>

<p>"By the stars, you're right!" yelled Connel. "It's Corbett!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>
<p>Astro jumped up and yelled, "Tom! Tom! You big
space-brained jerk! It's me, Astro!"</p>

<p>Behind the corner of a house, Tom peered cautiously
around the edge and saw the big cadet scramble over
the tangle of barbed wire with Connel right behind
him. Tom held up his hand for the squad in back of him
to hold their fire and stepped out to meet his friends.
"Major! Astro!"</p>

<p>The three spacemen pounded each other on the back
while the patrol of Marines watched, grinning. "Where's
Roger?" asked Tom finally.</p>

<p>Astro quickly told him of the heavily guarded administration
building.</p>

<p>"Is he all right?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"No one knows," replied Connel. "We haven't been
able to get any news of him at all."</p>

<p>"I'm going after him," said Tom, his jaw set. "No telling
what they'll try to do with him when they see their
goose is cooked."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Astro.</p>

<p>"No, you stay here with Major Connel," said Tom.
"I think it would be better if just one tried it, with the
rest creating a diversion on the other side."</p>

<p>"Good idea," said Connel. He turned to the rest of
the patrol. "Men, there's an injured Space Cadet in the
sick bay of the main building. He's the third member
of the <i>Polaris</i> unit and has contributed as much to victory
in this battle as any of us. We've got to get him out
of the hands of the Nationalists before something happens
to him. Are you willing to try?"</p>

<p>The Marines agreed without hesitation.</p>

<p>"All right," said Connel, "here's what we'll do."
Quickly the major outlined a plan whereby Tom would
sneak through the lines of the Nationalists around the
administration building, while the rest of them created
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>a diversionary move. It was a daring plan that would
require split-second timing. When they were all agreed
as to what they would do and the time of the operation
was set, they moved off toward the administration
building. The rebellion was over, defeated. Yet the Nationalist
leaders were still alive. They were desperate
men and Roger was in their hands. His life meant more
to Tom Corbett and Astro than the smashing victory of
the Solar Guard, and they were prepared to give their
own lives to save his.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_19" id="CHAPTER_19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>


<p>"Ready?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"All set, sir," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Remember, we'll open up in exactly five minutes and
we'll continue to attack for another seven minutes.
That's all the time you have to get inside, find Roger,
and get out again."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Move out," said Connel, "and spaceman's luck!"</p>

<p>With a last quick glance at Astro who gave him a reassuring
nod, Tom dropped to his knees and crawled
out from behind their hidden position. Dropping flat on
his stomach, he inched forward toward the administration
building. All around him ray guns and blasters
were firing with regularity as the columns of Marines
advanced from all sides of the canyon toward the center,
mopping up everything in front of them. The roof
of the administration building seemed a solid sheet of
fire as the Nationalist leaders fought back desperately.</p>

<p>He reached the side of the building that was windowless,
and scrambled toward the back door without
interference. There he saw five green-clad men,
crouched behind sandbags, protecting the rear entrance.
Glancing at his watch he saw the sweeping hand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>tick off the last few seconds of his allotted time. At the
exact instant it hit the five-minute mark, there was a
sudden burst of activity at the front of the building.
Connel and the Marine patrol had opened fire in a
mock attack. The men guarding the rear left their barricade
and raced into the building to meet the new assault.</p>

<p>Without a second's hesitation, Tom jumped toward
the door. He reached up, found it unlocked, and then
with his ray gun ready, kicked the door open. He
rushed in and dived to the floor, ray gun in his hand,
ready to freeze anything or anyone in sight.</p>

<p>The hall was empty. In the front, the firing continued
and the halls of the building echoed loudly with the
frantic commands of the defenders. Gliding along the
near wall, Tom moved slowly forward. Before him, a
door was ajar and he eased toward it. On tiptoe the
curly-haired cadet inched around the edge of the door
and glanced inside. He saw a Nationalist guard on his
hands and knees loading empty shock rifles. Tom
quickly stepped inside and jammed his gun in the man's
back. "Freeze!" he said between his teeth.</p>

<p>The trooper tensed, then relaxed, and slowly raised
his hands.</p>

<p>"Where's the sick bay?" demanded Tom.</p>

<p>"On the second floor, at the end of the hall."</p>

<p>"Is that where you're keeping Cadet Manning?" demanded
Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man. "He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom fired before the trooper could finish. It was
rough, but he knew he had to act swiftly if he was to
help Roger. The trooper was frozen in his kneeling position,
and Tom scooped up a loaded shock rifle before
slipping back into the hall. It was still empty. The firing
outside seemed to be increasing.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p>He located the stairs, and after a quick but careful
check, started up, heart pounding, guns ready. On the
second floor he glanced up and down the hall, and
jumped back into the stair well quickly. Firing from an
open window, three troopers were between him and
the only door at the end of the hall. Not sure if Roger
was in that room or not, Tom had to make sure by looking.
And the only way he could do that was to eliminate
the men in his way. He dropped to one knee and
took careful aim with the ray pistol. It would be tricky
at such long range, but should the paralo-ray fail, the
cadet was prepared to use the shock rifle. He fired, and
for a breathless second waited for the effects of the ray
on the troopers. Then he saw the men go rigid and he
smiled. Three hundred feet with a ray pistol was very
fancy shooting!</p>

<p>He raced for the door. As he entered the room, he
saw a figure stretched out on the floor. He stopped still,
cold fear clutching at his heart.</p>

<p>"Roger!" he called. The blond-haired cadet didn't
move. Tom jumped to his unit mate's side and dropped
to one knee beside him. It was dark in the room and he
couldn't see very well, but there was no need for light
when he felt Roger's pulse.</p>

<p>"Frozen, by the stars!" he exclaimed. He stepped
back, flipped the neutralizer switch on his ray gun, and
fired a short burst. Almost immediately Roger groaned,
blinked his eyes, and sat up.</p>

<p>"Roger! Are you all right?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;sure. I'm O.K.," mumbled his unit mate.
"Those dirty space rats. They didn't know what to do
with me when the Marines landed, so they froze me.
They were scared to kill me. Afraid of reprisals."</p>

<p>"They sure used their heads that time," said Tom
with a grin. "How's your back?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p>"Fine. I just wrenched it a little. It's better now. But
never mind me. What's going on? Where's Astro and
Major Connel? And how did you get here?"</p>

<p>Tom gave him a quick run-down on everything that
had happened, concluding with, "Major Connel and
Astro, with a patrol of Solar Guard Marines, are outside
now drawing the Nationalist fire. Time's running out on
us fast. Think you can walk?"</p>

<p>"Spaceboy," replied Roger, "to get out of this place
I'd crawl on my hands and knees!"</p>

<p>"Then come on!" Tom gave the shock rifle to his unit
mate and stepped back into the hall. It was quiet. Tom
waved at Roger to follow and slipped down the hall toward
the stairs. Outside, the Marine patrol continued
firing, never letting up for a second. The two boys
reached the stairs and had started down when Tom
grabbed Roger by the arm. "There's someone moving
around down there!"</p>

<p>They hugged the wall and held their breath. Tom
glanced at his watch. Only forty-five seconds to go before
the Marines would stop firing and retire. They had
to get out of the building!</p>

<p>"We'll have to take a chance, Roger," murmured
Tom. "We'll try to rush them and fight our way out."</p>

<p>"Don't bother!" said a harsh voice behind them. The
two cadets spun around and looked back toward the
second floor. Standing at the top of the stairs, Rex Sinclair
scowled down at them, ray guns in each hand, leveled
at the two cadets.</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" cried Roger. "You!"</p>

<p>"That's one of the things I forgot to tell you, Roger,"
said Tom wryly. "Sinclair belongs to this outfit too!"</p>

<p>"Belongs!" roared Roger. "Look at that white uniform
he's wearing! This yellow rat is Lactu, the head of the
whole Nationalist movement!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom gaped at the white-clad figure at the head of the
stairs. "The leader!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Corbett," replied Sinclair quietly. "And
if it hadn't been for three nosy cadets, I would have
been the leader of the whole planet. But it's finished
now. All that is left for me is escape. And you two are
going to help me do just that!"</p>

<p>Roger suddenly dropped to one knee and leveled the
blaster. But the Nationalist leader was too quick. His
paralo-ray crackled and Roger was frozen solid.</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;!" roared Tom.</p>

<p>"Drop your gun, Corbett," warned Sinclair, "and take
that blaster away from him."</p>

<p>"I'll get you, Sinclair," said Tom through clenched
teeth, "and when I do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop the talk and get busy!" snapped Sinclair.</p>

<p>Tom took the blaster out of Roger's paralyzed hands
and dropped it on the floor. Still holding one ray gun on
Tom, Sinclair flipped on the neutralizer of the other gun
and released Roger again.</p>

<p>"Now get moving down those stairs!" <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'order'.">ordered</ins> Sinclair.
"One more funny move out of either of you and I'll do
more than just freeze you."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with us?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"As I said, you are going to help me escape. This time
the Solar Guard has won. But there are other planets,
other people who need strong leadership and who like
to put on uniforms and play soldier. People will always
find reason to rebel against authority, and I will be
there to channel their frustrations into my own plans.
Perhaps it will be Mars. Or Ganymede. Or even Titan.
Another name, another plan, and once again the Solar
Guard will have to fight me. Only next time, I assure
you, it is I who will win!"</p>

<p>"There won't be any next time," growled Roger.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>"You're washed up now. This base is swarming with
Marines. How do you think you're going to get out of
here?"</p>

<p>"You shall see, my friend. You shall see!"</p>

<p>Sinclair motioned them toward a door on the ground
floor. "Open it!" demanded Sinclair. Tom opened it and
stepped inside. It was a cleaner's closet, crammed with
old-fashioned mops and pails and dirty rags. Sinclair
pushed Roger inside and was about to follow when several
green-clad guards came running down the hall toward
them.</p>

<p>"Lactu! Lactu!" they shouted frantically. "They're
pouring into the base! The Solar Guard&mdash;they've got us
surrounded!"</p>

<p>"Keep fighting!" snapped Sinclair. "Don't surrender!
Inflict as much damage as possible!"</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where are you going?" asked one of the
men, looking at the closet speculatively.</p>

<p>"Never mind me!" barked Sinclair. "Do as I tell you.
Fight back!"</p>

<p>"It looks like we're losing a leader," observed another
of the men slowly. "You wouldn't be running out on us,
would you, Lactu?"</p>

<p>Sinclair fired three quick blasts from the ray guns,
freezing the men solid, and then turned back to Tom
and Roger. "Stay in that closet and do as I tell you."</p>

<p>Inside the closet, Sinclair kicked a pail out of the way
and barked, "Remove the loose plank in the floor and
drop it on the floor."</p>

<p>Tom felt around until he found the loose board and
lifted it up.</p>

<p>"What's down there?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"You'll see," said Sinclair. "Now step back, both of
you!"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger backed up and watched while Sinclair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>bent over the hole in the floor. He felt around inside
with one hand and appeared to turn something.
Suddenly the wall opposite the two cadets slid back to
reveal a narrow flight of stairs leading down. Sinclair
motioned with his gun again. "Get going, both of you."</p>

<p>Tom stepped forward, followed by Roger, and they
started down the stairs. At the bottom they found themselves
in a narrow tunnel about four hundred feet underground.
The floor of the tunnel slanted downward
sharply.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-210.png" width="500" height="425" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"At the end of this tunnel," announced Sinclair, "is a
clearing and in that clearing is a spaceship. It is nearly
three miles from the canyon. By the time the Solar
Guard learns of my absence, we shall be lost in space."</p>

<p>"We?" asked Tom. "You're taking us with you?"</p>

<p>"But of course," said Sinclair. "How else would I assure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>myself that the Solar Guard will not harm me unless
I take two of their most honored Space Cadets
with me?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"It's been fifteen minutes," announced Connel, "and
they haven't come out yet. There's only one thing to do.
Take that building and find out what's happened."</p>

<p>The major was crouched behind a wrecked jet car,
staring at the administration building.</p>

<p>"I can get that Marine captain over to our left to co-ordinate
an attack with us, sir," suggested Astro.</p>

<p>"It's risky," said Connel. "They still have a lot of men
in there. But if we wait for another column to reach us,
it might be too late. All right, Astro, tell him we're attacking
in ten minutes and ask him to give us all the
help he can."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Astro, and flopped to the ground to
worm his way toward the head of the Marine column
on the left.</p>

<p>It took the cadet nearly five minutes to cover the
hundred yards between the two Solar Guard positions.
Several times the firing became so heavy that the cadet
was forced to remain still on the ground while rifle and
ray-gun fire crackled over his head. He made it finally,
several Marines coming out to help him over the top of
the barrier. Gasping for breath, the big cadet asked to
see the commanding officer.</p>

<p>A grimy, tired-looking officer turned and walked over
to the cadet.</p>

<p>"Astro!"</p>

<p>"Captain Strong!"</p>

<p>"Where's Tom and Roger and Major Connel?" demanded
Strong.</p>

<p>Astro told the captain of Tom's attempt to save Roger
and that nothing had been heard from him since. "Major
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Connel wants us to attack together," Astro continued.
"He's jumping off in four minutes!"</p>

<p>"Right!" snapped Strong. He turned to a young Solar
Guard officer waiting respectfully near by. "You take
them in, Ferris. Full frontal attack. Don't use blasters
unless you have to. Take as many prisoners as possible."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I'll go back to the other position with Cadet Astro.
Start your attack as soon as you see Major Connel and
his men go in."</p>

<p>"Got it, sir," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Strong and Astro made their way back to Connel's
position quickly, and after a brief but hearty handclasp,
the two officers began plotting the last assault against
the Nationalists' stronghold. While other Marine columns
were wiping up small groups of rebels fighting
from disabled spaceships, repair shops, and other buildings,
Strong's column had been driving straight for the
heart of the base. The administration building was the
last barrier between them and complete victory over
the rebels.</p>

<p>Strong and Connel spoke briefly of Tom and Roger,
neither wanting to voice his inner fears in front of Astro.
The Nationalists previously had shown little regard
for human life. Now, with their backs to the wall, Connel
and Strong knew that if Tom and Roger were captured,
they might be used as hostages to ensure safe
passage for some of the rebels.</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Connel finally. "Tom and Roger will
be expecting us." He forced himself to grin at Astro, but
the giant cadet turned and faced the building grimly.
Connel lifted his hand, took a last look up and down the
line of waiting Marines, then brought his hand down
quickly. "Over the top. Spaceman's luck!" he shouted.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>The Marines vaulted over the top of their defense position
and charged madly toward the building, all guns
blazing. The Nationalists returned the fire, and for the
first few seconds it seemed that the world had suddenly
gone mad. Strong found himself shouting, running, and
firing in a red haze. Astro was roaring at the top of his
lungs, and Connel just charged ahead blindly. Marines
began to drop on all sides, cut down by the withering
fire. Then, when it appeared that they would have to
fall back, the main column, led by the Solar Guard lieutenant,
broke through the last barricade and swarmed
into the building.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the battle was over. The last remnants
of the Nationalists had been defeated and the
green-clad troopers were herded into the streets like
cattle. Strong and Connel, followed by Astro, charged
through the building like wild bulls searching for Tom
and Roger.</p>

<p>"No sign of them," said Strong finally. "They must
have slipped out somehow."</p>

<p>"No!" roared Connel. "They've been taken out of here
as hostages. I'll bet my life on that. There must be a secret
way out of here!"</p>

<p>"Come on," said Strong. "Let's find it." Suddenly he
stopped. "Look! Those three troopers outside that door!
They're frozen! Let's have a look there first!"</p>

<p>They rushed over to the closet where the three Nationalists
had been frozen by Sinclair.</p>

<p>Strong stopped and gasped. "By the craters of Luna,
it's Sharkey!"</p>

<p>"Sharkey? Who's that?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Supposed to be the leader of the Nationalists," said
Connel.</p>

<p>Strong quickly released Sharkey from the paralo-ray
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>effects and the man shuddered so violently from the reaction
that Astro had to grab him to keep him from falling
down.</p>

<p>"Where are Corbett and Manning?" demanded Connel.</p>

<p>"Lactu ... he took them both in there ... through
a secret passageway." Sharkey pointed to the closet
with a trembling finger.</p>

<p>Strong jumped for the closet door and jerked it open.
He saw the open wall and the stairs leading down.
"Come on! This way!"</p>

<p>Connel ran wildly into the closet, followed by Astro.
Suddenly the big cadet stopped, turned, and fired point-blank
at the figurehead of the Nationalist rebellion.
Sharkey once again grew rigid.</p>

<p>The two Solar Guard officers raced down the stairs
into the tunnel and ran headlong through the darkness.
Time was precious now. The lives of Tom and Roger
might be lost by a wasted second.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_20" id="CHAPTER_20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>


<p>"What's that noise, Tom?"</p>

<p>The two cadets were walking through the tunnel
when they heard the strange booming roar. Behind
them, Sinclair overheard Roger's whispered question
and laughed. "That is the sound of the slaves being fed
their lunch. They do not know yet that there has been
a battle and soon they'll be free!"</p>

<p>"Slaves!" gasped Roger. "What kind of slaves?"</p>

<p>"You shall see. Keep going!" Sinclair prodded the cadets
with his ray gun. The tunnel had grown larger and
the downward slant of the floor lessened as they pressed
forward. The noise ahead of them grew louder and
stronger and now they could distinguish occasional
words above the din.</p>

<p>"We must pass through the big vault where the
slaves are working," said Sinclair. "I would advise you
to keep your mouths shut and do as I say!"</p>

<p>Neither Tom nor Roger answered, keeping their eyes
straight ahead.</p>

<p>The tunnel suddenly cut sharply to the right and they
could see a blaze of light in front of them. The two boys
stopped involuntarily, and then were nudged forward
by Sinclair's guns. Before them was a huge cavern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>nearly a thousand yards high and three thousand yards
across, illuminated by hundreds of torches. Along one
side of the cave a line of men were waiting to have battered
tin plates filled from a huge pot at the head of the
line. The men were in rags, and every one of them was
hardly more than skin and bones. At strategic places
around the cavern, Nationalist guards kept their guns
trained and ready to fire. They brought up their guns
quickly as Tom and Roger entered, and then lowered
them again as Sinclair appeared. Every eye turned to
the Nationalist leader as he marched across the floor of
the cave, Tom and Roger walking before him.</p>

<p>"You see," said Sinclair, "these wretched fools thought
my organization was a utopia until they learned that I
was no better for them than the Solar Guard. Unfortunately
they learned too late and were sent here to dig
underground pits for my spaceships and storage
dumps."</p>

<p>The small column of three marched across the floor
of the cave toward another small tunnel on the opposite
side. The slaves were absolutely still, and the guards
smiled a greeting at their leader when he passed them.</p>

<p>Sinclair ignored them all. "Beyond that tunnel," he
continued, pointing to the small opening ahead of them,
"there is a spaceship. We will board that ship and blast
off. The three of us. Where we will go, I haven't decided
yet. Perhaps a long trip into deep space until the
Solar Guard has forgotten about you and me and the
Nationalists. Then we will return, as I said before, to
Mars, or perhaps Ganymede, and I will start all over
again."</p>

<p>"You're mad!" said Tom through clenched teeth.
"Crazy as a space bug!"</p>

<p>"We shall see, Corbett. We shall see!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Roger broke away and raced toward the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>mass of slaves. He shouted wildly, "Get the guards! The
Nationalists are beaten! The base in the canyon has
been destroyed! Hurry! Rebel!"</p>

<p>The emaciated men milled around the cadet, all asking
questions at once.</p>

<p>Sinclair signaled to the guards. "Shoot him down!"
Four guards took careful aim.</p>

<p>"Roger! Look out!" warned Tom.</p>

<p>Roger whirled around in time to see the guards about
to fire. He dived for a mound of dirt and hid behind it.
The energy shock waves licked at the sand where he
had stood a second before. Roger got up and ran for
better cover, the guards continuing to fire at him. Then,
around the cadet, the slave workers began to come
alive. Some hurled stones at the guards, others began
climbing up the sides to the ledges where the guards
stood. Taking in the situation at a glance, Sinclair
shoved the ray gun in Tom's back and snarled, "Get
going!"</p>

<p>The young cadet had no alternative. He turned and
marched hurriedly across the floor toward the small
tunnel ahead of him. Several slave workers tried to attack
Sinclair, but in their weakened condition, they
were no match for the alert Nationalist leader who
froze them instantly with his paralo-ray gun.</p>

<p>Roger saw Tom heading for the tunnel and made a
sudden dash for Sinclair. But the rebel leader heard the
pounding of footsteps and turned to fire at Roger as the
cadet sailed through the air in a flying tackle. The jolting
ray hit him squarely and he landed on the ground
with a thud a few feet from Sinclair, completely immobilized
again.</p>

<p>Tom tried to seize the momentary advantage, but
once again Sinclair was quicker and forced Tom back
into the small opening of the tunnel.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>Around them, the slave workers were being whipped
into a frenzy after months of stored-up hatred for their
guards. Hundreds of them were climbing up toward the
guards' posts, unmindful of the deadly fire pouring
down on them.</p>

<p>"Get in there quick!" demanded Sinclair. He shoved
Tom through the small opening, and after a quick
glance over his shoulder at the surging slaves, followed
the cadet.</p>

<p>Sinclair flashed a light ahead of them and Tom saw
the reflection of a bright surface. In the distance he recognized
the outlines of a spaceship.</p>

<p>"Keep moving!" ordered Sinclair. "You're my protection
in getting out of here, and if I have to freeze you
and carry you aboard, that's just what I'll do! Now get
moving!"</p>

<p>Tom walked to the air lock of the ship, Sinclair right
in back of him. The rebel leader pressed an outside button
in the ship's stabilizer fin and the port swung open
slowly. "Get in!" growled Sinclair.</p>

<p>Tom stepped into the ship and waited. Sinclair
climbed in in back of him and closed the air lock.</p>

<p>"Through that hatch," said Sinclair, motioning toward
the iron ladder, "and keep your hands in the air."</p>

<p>"How do you think you're going to get through the
Solar Guard fleet that's standing off above the canyon?"
asked Tom casually. "As soon as they see this ship blast
off, you'll have a hundred atomic war heads blasting
after you!"</p>

<p>"Not as long as I have you!" sneered Sinclair. "You're
my protection!"</p>

<p>"You're wrong," said Tom. "They'll open fire, anyway."</p>

<p>"That's the chance I've got to take," said Sinclair.
"Now climb up to the control deck and get on the audioceiver.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>You're going to tell them you're aboard!"</p>

<p>Tom walked ahead of the rebel leader toward the
control deck, his mind racing. He knew that Sinclair
was going through with his plan and he also knew that
the Solar Guard would not pay any attention to anything
he had to say. If, after three warnings, Sinclair
didn't brake jets and bring his ship to a stop, he would
be blasted out of space. He had to do something.</p>

<p>"Where's the communicator?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Over by the radar scanner." Sinclair eyed him suspiciously.
"Remember, Corbett, your life depends on this
as much as mine. If you don't convince them you're
worth saving by letting me get away, you're a dead
pigeon!"</p>

<p>"You don't have to tell me," said Tom. "I know when
I'm licked."</p>

<p>Sinclair took his position in the pilot's chair, facing
the control panel. For a brief moment his back was to
Tom as he bent over to turn on the generators. Tom
took a deep breath and lurched across the deck. But
Sinclair turned and saw him coming, and jerked up the
ray gun. He wasn't able to get clear in time. Tom's fingers
circled the barrel of the gun as Sinclair fired. The
barrel grew hot as Sinclair fired repeatedly. Tom's fingers
were beginning to blister under the intense heat,
but he held on. With his other hand he reached up for
the rebel's throat. Sinclair grabbed his wrist and, locked
together, they rolled around on the deck.</p>

<p>Sinclair continued to fire the ray gun and Tom's fingers
were burning with pain from the heat. Suddenly
the cadet let go the gun, spun around, and jerked Sinclair
off balance. He swung his free hand as hard as he
could into the rebel's stomach. Sinclair doubled over
and staggered back, dropping the gun. Tom was on top
of him like a shot, pounding straight, jolting rights and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>lefts to the man's head and stomach. But Sinclair was
tough. He twisted around, and quick as a cat, jumped
to his feet. Then, stepping in, he rapped a solid right to
Tom's jaw. The cadet reeled back, nearly falling to the
deck. Sinclair was in on top of him in a flash, pounding
his head and body with vicious smashing blows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/ill-220.png" width="387" height="500" alt="Sinclair wasn&#39;t able to get clear in time" title="" />
<span class="caption">Sinclair wasn&#39;t able to get clear in time</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom fell to the floor under the savagery of the rebel
leader's attack. Sinclair lifted his foot to kick the cadet
as Tom's fingers tightened around the barrel of the
discarded ray gun. He brought it up sharply against the
planter's shin and he staggered back in pain. Tom took
careful aim. He fired the gun. Nothing happened. The
gun was empty.</p>

<p>Sinclair rushed the cadet again, but Tom stepped
aside and swung the heavy gun with all his might. The
metal smashed against Sinclair's head and he sank to
the deck, out cold.</p>

<p>The last rebel of Venus had been defeated.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"We found Roger trying to keep the slaves away from
the guards," said Strong. "They were ready to tear them
apart!"</p>

<p>"Can't say that I blame them," snorted Connel.
"Some of those poor devils had been working in the
caves for three years!"</p>

<p>Tom, Roger, and Astro sat sprawled in chairs in one
of the offices of the Nationalist headquarters listening
to Strong and Major Connel sum up the day's battle.
The entire army of Nationalist guards, Division Chiefs,
and workers had been rounded up and put aboard the
troop carriers to be taken to a prison asteroid. Each individual
rebel would be dealt with under special court
proceedings to be established by Solar Alliance decree
later.</p>

<p>"There are still some things I don't understand," said
Astro. "How did they know you were going to investigate
them in the first place?"</p>

<p>"After our meeting with Commander Walters," said
Connel, "we sent a special coded message to the Solar
Alliance Delegate here on Venus. His secretary intercepted
the message, used stolen priorities for himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>and two assistants to get to Earth and back on an express
space liner without being missed."</p>

<p>"The secretary!" shouted Tom. "That's the same fellow
I saw in Atom City when we were bumped out of
our seats on the <i>Venus Lark</i>!"</p>

<p>Roger looked up at Tom with a scowl. "A fine time to
remember!"</p>

<p>Strong grinned. "We discovered him, Tom, when that
attempt was made to kidnap you by the cab driver. We
also picked up the owner of the pawnshop."</p>

<p>"The most amazing thing about this space joker, Sinclair,"
commented Connel, "was the way he had everyone
fooled. I couldn't figure out how he was able to get
around so quickly until I learned about those buildings."</p>

<p>"What buildings?" asked Tom, suddenly remembering
how the rebel leader had disappeared so quickly
and quietly when he was being held captive with Mr.
and Mrs. Hill in the Sinclair home.</p>

<p>"Every one of the important members of the organization,
the Division Chiefs, they called themselves, had
a small shack on his property near the edge of the jungle.
It was nothing more than a covering for a shaft that
led to a tunnel, which, in turn, led to other tunnels under
the jungle and eventually connected with one leading
right into the base."</p>

<p>"You mean," said Astro, "they have underground tunnels
all through the jungle?"</p>

<p>"That's right," asserted Connel. "If they had been
prepared for our attack, they could have beaten the
pants off us. Not only in space, but on the ground. They
could have run circles around us in those tunnels. I got
suspicious when I found a hut at the Sharkey place
with no windows in it."</p>

<p>"Say, remember the time Sinclair barked at me for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>going near that shack on his place when we first arrived?"
said Roger.</p>

<p>Connel grinned. "I'll bet you a plugged credit that if
you had opened that door you'd have been frozen stiffer
than a snowman on Pluto."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," said Tom happily, "we got what we
came after."</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Strong.</p>

<p>"A tyrannosaurus!" replied the curly-haired cadet.</p>

<p>"And that's another thing," said Connel. "That tyrannosaurus
we killed was a pet of the Nationalists. I don't
mean a household pet, but it fitted into their plans
nicely. The tyranno's lair was near the top of that canyon.
Any time a stray hunter came along, the tyrannosaurus
would scare him away. So when you three came
along and said you were deliberately hunting for a tyrannosaurus,
they got worried."</p>

<p>"Worried?" asked Roger. "Why?"</p>

<p>"They thought you were actually hunting or investigating
them, and when I started nosing around, they
were sure. That's why Sinclair ordered his boys to burn
down his plantation&mdash;to try to throw us off the track. So
you see," Connel concluded, "your summer leave really
started the ball rolling against them."</p>

<p>"Summer leave!" shouted Roger. "What day is it?"</p>

<p>"The twenty-ninth of August," replied Strong.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" moaned the blond-haired cadet. "We start
back to class in three days!"</p>

<p>"Three days!" roared Astro. "But&mdash;but it'll take three
days to write up our reports of everything that's happened!
We won't have any time for fun!"</p>

<p>"Fun!" snorted Connel. "Fun is for little boys. You
three space-brained, rocket-headed idiots are spacemen!"</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
