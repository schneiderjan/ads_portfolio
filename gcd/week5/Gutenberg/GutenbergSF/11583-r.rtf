\par 
\par A most remarkable invention is weaving the world together in a way we never 
anticipated while you were on Earth, and it netted your writing. Fans of your books for juveniles, The Digby Allen series, were able to connect to each other, share their enthusiasm for your novels, and were inspired to co}{\insrsid3755814 n}{
\insrsid3755814 tinue the voyage. Led by Jonathan Cooper, the intrepid ma}{\insrsid3755814 s}{\insrsid3755814 termind of the creative crew, they made a commitment to write their own vision of the future. Thoughtfully, they credit you as ha}{
\insrsid3755814 v}{\insrsid3755814 ing shoulders broad enough for them to stand on and see the centuries beyond. The invention that has 
made this possible is called the internet. There seems no need to explain what it is here, but part of its magic is that it can permit people to co}{\insrsid3755814 n}{\insrsid3755814 nect to each other independently of time and space.
\par 
\par The themes of Dig Allen from the 1960\rquote s have worked like the internet in that they functioned independently of time and space, only much more slowly. You presented your ideas in books as ideas are posted on the internet. The authors of Sta}{
\insrsid3755814 r}{\insrsid3755814 man were drawn to the themes in your books and then each other in cyberspace, which acts as both the bookshelf and caf\'e9 for today\rquote s ideas and authors. The creators of Sta}{\insrsid3755814 r}{\insrsid3755814 
man saw value in your stories and tried to get the publisher to renew the series. Sadly, your old publisher ignored them and blocked the revival, as though they were so much space junk. 
\par 
\par No one owns a theme. But the creators of Starman have shown that they share some of the beliefs that you express in your subjects. Their young men of the stars prove that they too are brave, adventurous and willing to sacrifice for fre}{\insrsid3755814 e}
{\insrsid3755814 
dom and justice.  With a loyalty toward each other that would create envy in every generation, they test themselves against cunning scoundrels. As they conquer villains, they, and we along with them, learn whether they measure up. Will they prove the}{
\insrsid3755814 m}{\insrsid3755814 selves worthy as young people have done for all time? Young readers can have a chance to preview something about their own lives and the world they will live in. And just as you b}{\insrsid3755814 e}{\insrsid3755814 
lieved, somehow the human race survives. If the world of Starman is a
n accurate guess on the future, then the good guys, the ones in the white spacesuits, will continue to prevail and produce more young people to keep the dream alive. I hope that some of the next generation of courageous young people will read this series.
 
\par 
\par Your fans don\rquote t know that you started writing seriously rel}{\insrsid3755814 a}{\insrsid3755814 tively early in life, in the 1920\rquote s and \rquote 30\rquote 
s, first as a teen for your personal pleasure and then on your school newspaper at New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn, New York. Did ha}{\insrsid3755814 v}{\insrsid3755814 ing to learn 
the English language after speaking Russian until the age of seven help you become a better writer? Were your p}{\insrsid3755814 o}{\insrsid3755814 ems and letters to Mom valuable both to her and to your pr}{\insrsid3755814 o}{\insrsid3755814 
fessional development? Did the comic books you authored during the Golden Age of comics give you a better sense of story-telling and dialogue or did it degrade your love of la}{\insrsid3755814 n}{\insrsid3755814 
guage? I know that writing television scripts and other cre}{\insrsid3755814 a}{\insrsid3755814 tive projects supported the family during the difficult years of the 1950\rquote s, but how did it affect your later work with Digby A}{\insrsid3755814 l}{
\insrsid3755814 len? So many of your themes are repeated and reworked in several of your creations right through to the late 1980\rquote s. Who would guess that you once wrote a paper on the use of the r}{\insrsid3755814 a}{\insrsid3755814 
ven in several of Shakespeare\rquote s plays? Or that you wrote bio}{\insrsid3755814 l}{\insrsid3755814 
ogy text to accompany a new medium, slides made from strips of 35-mm film? Would admirers realize that you were most interested in world events, but read the sports section of the New York Times first, everyday? I\rquote m certain your fans wouldn\rquote 
t have read the American Elsewhen Almanac, a comp}{\insrsid3755814 i}{\insrsid3755814 lation of bits of Americana and commentary that you pu}{\insrsid3755814 b}{\insrsid3755814 lished in the 1980\rquote s. 
\par 
\par I want to thank the authors of Starman for giving me the o}{\insrsid3755814 p}{\insrsid3755814 portunity to write the introduction to their second novel. If there is a w
ay to communicate to you across the veil between our dimensional world and the one in which you now reside, then it must be through the pages of a book. After the love of family, I don\rquote 
t believe anything was more precious to you than books, so maybe this letter will be able to cross the d}{\insrsid3755814 i}{\insrsid3755814 
vide. Just as I proofread the drafts of Digby Allen before you sent them to the publisher, your granddaughter and grandson proofread this. Perhaps that will act like a mystical booster rocket to get these pages to you. 
\par 
\par And to future space pioneers, may the solar winds be at your back.

 out of the clutches of their pursuers, but not by much. The crew of the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Spear}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  was suffering acutely from sleeples}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ness and mounting anxiety.
\par \tab Only days earlier, Lurton Zimbardo had been second-in-command under Troy Putnam. Together they had organized over 500 men and attempted to take control of the capital city of Mars in a sudden attack. Had they succeeded, the pirates could
 have held the people of the Earth-Moon sy}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tem hostage to their demands. The Starmen and their allies had thwarted the pirates\rquote  plan. Most of the pirates, inclu}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 d}{

\rquote  base in the Asteroid Belt. 
\par \tab The Belt loomed up. The first few chunks of rock were visible now to the unaided eyes of those on the deck of the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Silver Spear}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 . In seconds, they were among them. The nav}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{

\par \tab \'93Fool!\'94 shouted Zimbardo. \'93Turn on the automatic p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 lot!\'94 The navigator\rquote s eyes were the size of saucers. Imm}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 bile with terror, he didn
\rquote t respond to Zimbardo\rquote s command. The former second-in-command of the pirates pushed him out of the chair, took over, and activated the switch that cut in the automatic pilot. Lurton Zimbardo was not physically imposing, but more than 
made up for his slight build with an immensely strong will and a decisive nature that was me}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ciless whenever it served him.
\par }\pard \qj \fi216\li0\ri0\widctlpar\nooverflow\faroman\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs21\insrsid3755814 He knew they were going too fast even for the automatic pilot to keep the ship safe once they entered the thick sweep of the asteroi
ds. He also knew that the Belt was their only hope of escaping the Starmen on their trail. Powered by adrenaline, his senses were functioning at their peak. With amazing alacrity and intensity, Zimbardo aided the aut}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 matic pilot and threaded the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Silver Spear}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  through the weaving asteroids. It almost seemed as if he were in a trance.
\par Soon a dark asteroid loomed ahead, roughly shaped like a potato, forty-five miles long and twenty-five wide, rota}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing slowly around its longest axis. It was nearly invisible both
 to the eye and to the instruments, but Zimbardo knew where it was. He barked out a command. The }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Silver Spear}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
 slowed quickly, and moments later a huge airlock door opened in one of the poles of the asteroid. Zimbardo piloted the ship into the airlock, through the stone tunnel that led into the interior of the asteroid, and then touched down.
\par The thin, wiry man raced for the control room as fast as he could run, pushing men out of the way and heeding no one who called out to him. Once inside, he quickly pres
sed a series of buttons and entered a numeric code. Once it was entered and confirmed, he made a fist and slammed it hard on a large red button. Immediately all the radar screens were co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 v}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ered with snow.
\par Zimbardo relaxed for the first time in days. He exhaled quietly and actually smiled. He took a deep breath and smiled more broadly.
\par \'93Sir?\'94 asked one of the technicians who had watched the procedure.
\par \'93I detonated a hydrogen bomb on a neighboring asteroid a couple of hundred miles from here. Part of a backup p
lan for keeping this place hidden. It will clog all radar screens for a few minutes. By the time they clear, no one will be able to find us or this asteroid.\'94
\par Zimbardo\rquote s relaxed state did not last long. He swelled up with energy again, strode to another console, and tapped in a series of commands.
\par \'93Come here, Gene,\'94 he ordered as his fingers flew over the keyboard. The man he addressed quickly came to stand by the pirate leader. He was a well-built young man in his late twenties with short curly brown hair,
 finely chiseled features, and an obvious desire to please. He was well trained in the technology of space control systems. After he had proven his competence in the field, Troy Putnam had made him his chief control officer.
\par Zimbardo continued. \'93Follow these coordinates at this speed. Don\rquote t alter the course for any reason without my permission.\'94
\par Gene looked at the planning board where the numbers were posted in a pleasant green light. \'93That course will take us out of the Belt, Mr. Zimbardo. Is that what you want?\'94
\par \'93That\rquote s what I want. It\rquote s time to move away from here. If anything out of the ordinary happens, let me know immed}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ately. Find me by using my personal code on the commun}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i

\par \'93Yes sir!\'94 Gene took his place and the others returned to their duties.
\par Once he saw that the crew members were well settled, he picked up the intercom and ordered his leaders to assemble in a meeting room in five minutes. From the few dozen p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
rates left, he had hand-selected five competent leaders to be his lieutenants: Gebbeth, Crass, Lather, Bolcher, and Slant.
\par In less than that time, Lurton Zimbardo was sitting at a table with the five other men. All but Zimbardo looked haggard. The 
pirates were demoralized and upset. Victory on Mars and beyond had been within their grasp, but it had all been blundered away. A band of several hundred men who had planned and worked for several years had been reduced to a few dozen. Their dreams of pow
er and prom}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 nence, shaped and fueled by their captain Troy Putnam, had been utterly destroyed. Now Putnam was in custody on Mars, along with the rest of the pirates who had been ca}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 p}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 tured by Earth\rquote s forces.
\par \'93Troy Putnam was a fool,\'94 Zimbardo announced in a quiet voice edged with steel. \'93His plan might have worked\emdash }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 might}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  have worked, if I had had more part in planning\emdash 
but he was no more than a conceited ignoramus! The Starmen walked in on him and took him completely by surprise! I can just imagine how his face 
must have looked as he realized his plan was over and he was led off to jail. A fool! We are better off without him!\'94
\par \'93Better off without him?\'94 asked one man in a dull voice. \'93What do you mean, Lurton? Better off for what?\'94
\par \'93Don\rquote t be a fool yourself, Crass!\'94 Zimbardo sneered. \'93You think we\rquote re finished here? We will still get what we want and it won\rquote t be very difficult! We don\rquote t need Putnam and we don\rquote 
t need a few hundred men, either! You can be thankful you\rquote re here instead of locked in a stone room in Eagle City eating square, plain, healthy meals off of a metal tray! The collapse of Putnam\rquote 
s big dream is the best thing that could have happened for us!\'94
\par A muscular, unsmiling man on Zimbardo\rquote s right swung his gaze to the speaker. \'93It sounds as if you have a plan, Mr. Zimbardo.\'94 The man was in his early thirties and r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
sembled a street fighter. His carefully combed dark hair made him look almost strikingly handsome, but his eyes were black and humorless.
\par Zimbardo turned toward the man. \'93Yes, I have a plan. You, Gebbeth, will be my chief assistant and the pilot of the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Tartarus}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 , my personal ship. I can depend on you. Space Command\rquote 
s celebration on Mars will be extremely short-lived.\'94
\par \'93You were always the strong one, Lurton,\'94 said another. \'93I kind of always figured you for the real leader, and I a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ways wished it was you instead of Putnam.\'94
\par \'93Now you got your wish, Bolcher. I\rquote ve taken charge. I\rquote m moving this asteroid out of its orbit into a place outside the Belt. Here\rquote s my plan.\'94
\par Almost an hour later, the men left the meeting room, smiling, joking, and stepping lightly. Their fatigue was gone, their discouragement forgotten.
\par Lurton Zimbardo was the last to leave. Now that things were moving in the direction he wanted, he allowed his fatigue to take over. Encouraged by the support of his assi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
tants, he felt he could rest at last. He walked down the halls, past various doors and entered an elevator. The di}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
play screen offered only the few floors in use by the pirates but Zimbardo had another destination in mind. Alone in the el}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
vator, he punched in a special code which only he knew. When the proper sequence was displayed, he pressed \'93E}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ter.\'94
 As the elevator began to move, the new leader of the pirates relaxed even further. The others would not know where he was, and he would be undi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 turbed.
\par He could barely sense the elevator\rquote s motion. He didn\rquote t know how far into the asteroid\rquote s interior he was moving, but he knew what he would find when he reached his dest}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
nation. The door opened and Zimbardo stepped out. A quick walk down a short corridor brought him to a double door. Embossed on the doors was a huge, rich, golden symbol\emdash 
a lush planet with about 80% blue oceans, a few continents, and thick cloud cover. Three small moons were arranged at the upper left, set at the points of an equilateral triangle. Zimbardo had been intrigued by the design when he\rquote 
d first found it, but now he hastened through the doors without noticing it. He was eager to get into the Chamber beyond.
\par As Lurton stepped into the room, he gasped. His dozen prior visits still had not taken the surprise out of the room. Each time he stepped into the Chamber he seemed to be se}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ting foot into another world; he knew he was still inside the asteroid but his senses told him otherwise.
\par Lurton seemed to be standing on a high mountain ove}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 looking a vast plain on some forgotten planet. A pale blue sky was overhead and a light wind was blowing. Down b}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 low on the plain he saw a river snaking its way through a green forest; if he listened carefully he could hear the w}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ter. In the distance he saw a fantastic alien metropolis of bea}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tiful glass skyscrapers; he could just barely make out ships hovering over it and small vehicles driving around in the distance. Clouds sailed gently ove}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
head; it was near dusk.
\par He knew that the room wa
s actually no more than about a hundred feet square, but the display was seamless. For all the world he seemed to be standing on another planet on a late, peaceful afternoon. He had never been able to find out how the room worked or where the wind came fr
om, but he suspected the display was generated by some sort of hol}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 graphic projectors far in advance of anything he had ever seen or heard of.
\par Lurton guessed that the scene was from the home planet of the asteroid\rquote s builders; perhaps the distant city was th
eir capital. He had spent hours watching the room and never tired of it, for the scene always changed. After a certain number of hours dusk fell and the city lights came on. He had watched different kinds of weather and seen glorious sunsets and sunrises.
 Occasionally he caught a glimpse of a huge alien starship. He had seen many strange things in the Chamber and he was sure that he had not seen them all.
\par Lurton liked coming here when he was upset or annoyed; the room had a peaceful air that rested and soothed him. He was certainly in need of that now. He hadn\rquote 
t slept in over fifty hours and could easily have lain down in what seemed like soft turf and fallen deeply asleep, but the ethereal beauty of the Chamber\rquote s vision was restful and he didn\rquote t want to clo
se his eyes for an instant while he was inside.

d found the room. The asteroid had been drifting and uninhabited for who knows how many thousands of years when a solitary aste}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 oid miner had found it and discovered that i
t was hollow. He had told a few others about his find and eventually Troy Putnam learned of it. Zimbardo grudgingly admitted to himself that Troy was a genius\emdash a weak, impractical ge}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

lse was a matter of trial and error, and the access codes were complex.
\par One day Zimbardo had found the Chamber. There was very little that could arouse any kind of sensitivity in the wiry, energetic man, but the Chamber could do so. Maybe it was because no 
one else knew about it and no one could see him wrapped in the depths of the emotions the room could inspire. The Chamber was not the only secret of the asteroid which Lurton had retained for himself, but it was certainly the best one.

f the pirates who knows where the asteroid is, how to find it, and has some knowledge of how it works. Where Putnam was willing to let St. George go about his business, Zimbardo will certainly determine to eliminate him. Zimbardo will try hard to find St.
 George. You must find him first. Protect him, and learn from him where the asteroid is.\'94

mission to take over Mars. The meeting had been going on for several hours and had involved a lot of detailed organizational work. The men were tired and showing it. As usual, Zi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 m}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
bardo showed no signs of fatigue.
\par \'93Yes, gentlemen,\'94 said Zimbardo, \'93You know what to do now. We will need to get all of our men busy and you must drive them, drive them relentlessly! I don\rquote t want to take any longer on this work than we need to. We\rquote 
ve been moving slowly out of the Asteroid Belt for almost three days.\'94
\par His laser pointer made a few small red circles on a chart in the library. \'93This is where we were, and this is where we\rquote re going to be.\'94
 The chart was nearly a full wall of smooth quartz, illumined from the inside and showing the nearby configuration of asteroids.
\par The table was strewn with large books opened to star maps, note pads, a couple of small computers and calcula}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing machines, and a huge number of crumpled balls of p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 per. One man reached for a pitcher of water that was on the table and slowly filled his glass. Zimbardo conti}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ued.
\par \'93The manufacturing will begin tomorrow\emdash that\rquote ll be for Stubb to oversee. Once the sheathing device has proven e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 f}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
fective we can begin work on restoring and disguising our fleet. After that, Crass, you\rquote ll take care of the rest.\'94
\par One of the men looked up. \'93What about St. George? If anyone discovers him he could put a serious crimp in our plans.\'94
\par Zimbardo looked annoyed. \'93St. George will be dealt with, Mr. Slant. I have not forgotten him; you can leave that to me. He will never speak to the Starmen or anyone else.\'94
\par Another spoke. \'93Is it really necessary to silence him? It will take a large number of men to make a search\emdash men we could use on the urgent projects at hand. Since you\rquote ve moved the asteroid from its original site, he can\rquote 
t find us now or show anyone else how to find us.\'94
\par \'93He can\rquote t find us, but he knows how this asteroid works\emdash almost as well as I do. If the Starmen learn what he knows, it could be disastrous for us in the unlikely chance that they ever locate us. I don\rquote t like taking chanc
es, and I don\rquote t like leaving any loose ends. St. George is a loose end we can\rquote t afford.\'94 
\par \'93Do you know where to find him? He doesn\rquote t have any fixed place he calls home.\'94
\par \'93Our men have quietly inquired for him on Ceres and learned that he has a good friend, another asteroid miner named Montezuma Vly. We know where Vly lives, and Vly will know where St. George is. Vly doesn\rquote 
t receive visitors, but his resistance won't keep a small fleet from landing. One way or another, Vly will tell us where to find George St. George\emdash and soon.\'94

\fs21\insrsid3755814 way. He walked with a firm tread, and men stepped aside with a slight deferential bow. He passed through the great glass doors at the end of
 the passage into a huge foyer. Passing through, he entered a courtyard, strode across it, and came into the working area.
\par About sixty men were working at various stations. The men felt that Zimbardo was a real leader and were glad to see their new commander. It was amazing how rapidly the sense of defeat had been changed to one of expectancy and pride. 
\par Every day or two another ship docked and new workers came in to join the crew. Zimbardo had sent out a few trusted leaders to recruit men form noted astero
id bases and mining operations in the proximity of his asteroid. He could use more men, especially skilled workers in electronics and mathematics, but he wasn\rquote 
t eager to build up a large force. He chose carefully. The workforce was being built up gradually with men he could trust. He had also invited three smugglers he had known before to join the operation, with their men.
\par \'93Stubb,\'94 called out Zimbardo.
\par \'93Sir,\'94 responded the man so addressed, an eager man about thirty years old, with sandy blond hair and baby blue eyes. He hastened up to the pirate leader.
\par \'93Give me a status report. The ships first.\'94
\par \'93The sheathing systems are easy to manufacture, thanks to the ample supplies from the warehouses. The men are able to put them together rapidly, even the unskilled wor}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \'93Good. And the power units?\'94
\par \'93These are far more complicated, sir, so I only have the most skilled workers assembling these. The same with the propulsion units. They won\rquote t be ready for at least a week, not even one of them. However, on

\par \'93How long until you have all 85 completed?\'94
\par \'93I should have a good number of the unskilled workers ready for a new assignment once they have finished with the sheathing plates. Once the design has been checked by the experts, we can get them cracking on the power and propu}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l

\par \tab \'93Quite a cloud of starships!\'94 remarked Joe as Yellow City came into view. A swarm of at least forty ships of an amazing variety of sizes, shapes, and vintages was moving over the port. S
ome were hovering, others were heading in toward the landing field and a few others were departing. None moved very fast since the space was as crowded as bees around a hive.
\par \tab Yellow City was a well planned settlement, in spite of having been developed joi
ntly by several different mining companies. Although the competition was fierce for the rich minerals of the Belt, cooperation was necessary to build the city, especially in the earliest years of settlement. The result was beneficial to all, as Yellow Cit
y could easily supply the needs of miners of all kinds as well as serve the traffic to the Outer Planets that almost always came by way of Ceres. Advancements in propulsion systems were ma}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \tab When Zip inquired about the offices of Starlight Ente}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 prise, the Starmen were ushered to a small moonbus and driven directly to the site. The complex was a small two-story building set in a row of 
offices, workshops, and g}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 rages not far from the landing field. All buildings on Ceres were made of the gray rock native to the asteroid. Building material was cheap and solid, but plain.

\par \'93What are you doing on Ceres, Kathryn?\'94 asked Zip. \'93I haven\rquote t seen you since your last visit to the Academy at the beginning of our senior year.\'94
 Kathryn Mullaney had graduated from Starlight Academy a year before Zip and his partners; her first assignment as a Starman was in the Outer Planets. She was twenty years old, wore her stra}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 w}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par There was a little more pleasant conversation, then Kat}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 h}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ryn said, \'93I\rquote ve got to be going, and Sim is waiting for you upstairs. Good luck!\'94
\par Zip, Mark, and Joe ascended the stairs and came to the landing. The stairway and corridors were very plain. There was no unnecessary ornamentation of any kind, and ligh}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ing was minimal. They found a door with a sign on it that read }{\scaps\fs21\insrsid3755814 Starlight Enterprise}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  in bold letters. A second line pr}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 vided the name of SE\rquote

\par \'93Come in,\'94 said a voice. The Starmen entered the door. The occupant, a tall, slender man of Indian extraction with black thinning hair, was already coming toward the door to welcome his visitors. \'93Welcome! So glad to see you! We}{

\par \'93Nice to see you again, Sim,\'94 greeted Zip. They sat down in a circle of chairs, Sim sitting near a table on which were placed all the makings necessa

\par The conversation continued as Sim poured the tea from a very large brown earthenware teapot. Before long, Zip brought up the subject of their visit.
\par \'93I wish we had more time to visit, Sim, but our assig}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ment is extremely urgent. We must find George St. George as

\par \'93Ah, yes,\'94 said Sim Sala Bim, \'93Sabbath George. He is well known here, but we haven\rquote t seen him in almost a year, I think. Almost a year.\'94
\par \'93Sabbath George?\'94 asked Mark.
\par \'93George St. George is a devout man\emdash genial, generous, liked and respected by everyone. Honest to a fault. He\rquote s called Sabbath George because of his beliefs. The nic}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par Sim nodded. \'93Montezuma\rquote s Castle is easily recognizable by its unusual shape. It is a true crescent, a sliver of stone with Vly\rquote s operation in its very center.\'94 Sim went on to pr}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par Zip continued. \'93On this assignment secrecy is of the u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 most importance. It is vital that no one knows who we are or what we\rquote re doing. We obviously can\rquote t take the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par With Sim, the Starmen made plans to leave the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Star Ranger}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  on Ceres while the Starmen, dressed in ordinary clothes, quietly departed for Montezuma\rquote s Castle in another ship.
\par \'93I\rquote ll let you have the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Vigilant Warrior}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ,\'94 said Sim. \'93It\rquote s a local ship, designed for operating in the Asteroid Belt. We own it, but it hasn\rquote t

\par \'93I\rquote m sure it\rquote ll be fine, if you say so,\'94 answered Zip.
\par Sim Sala Bim got right to work, and the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Vigilant Warrior}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  was ready for takeoff within two hours. As soon as it was ready, the Starmen lifted off from Yellow City. As Joe p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{

\par \'93Well, }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 that\rquote s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  a new one. George in danger? What about it?\'94
\par \'93May we land, Mr. Vly? I don\rquote t want to take the slightest risk that our conversation can be overheard. We won\rquote t stay any longer than necessary.\'94
\par \'93You\rquote ve found me. May as well come in and state your business.\'94 The communicator was shut off from Vly\rquote s end.
\par Zip came up on the Castle. It didn\rquote 
t take long to find the landing site. There were two spacecraft in position in about the middle of the asteroid. One was a small ship suitable for local jaunts, and the other was a normal-sized craft capable of interplanetary travel. The name }{
\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Sentinel}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  was painted on the side of the larger craft. Both were very old and in places a little battered, but were clearly cared about and well kept up.
\par The }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Vigilant Warrior}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  touched down about fifty yards from the closest of Vly\rquote s craft. Joe shut off th
e engines and pressed the security button. A slight shudder ran through the ship as bolts shot from the fins, securing the ship to the surface. The Starmen disembarked and descended the la}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 der.
\par \'93Over there,\'94 pointed Joe. The entrance to the airlock was dis
cernible across the tiny landing area. The Starmen began walking toward it. The starfield swept away to right and left, with a couple of nearby asteroids visible to the eye. A great horn of stone rose up before them, sweeping to a point above. Behind them
 a similar horn curved up in the opposite direction.
\par The ground was uneven, with contours sharply defined. Jagged, broken rock comprised most of the terrain, with a few smooth ripples which rose about twenty or thirty feet from the plain. Shadows were utter
ly dark in the vacuum of space. The Starmen wore asteroid shoes, designed for walking in low gravity conditions. Their soles had an aut}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 matic \'93smart grip\'94
 function that gripped the ground when weight was placed on them, but released when the walker took another step. Without the asteroid shoes, the minimal gravity of \'93Montezuma\rquote s Castle\'94 would have made wal}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing a difficult, even dangerous, task.
\par The Starmen saw that the airlock was set into the side of a hill. The hill had been artificially cut away in fron
t of the door. As Zip, Mark, and Joe approached the airlock, the outer door opened. When they had passed through, it shut behind them. Joe kept watch on the instruments as air filled the compartment. When the atmosphere had become no}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 mal, he removed his he
lmet, and Zip and Mark followed suit. They opened the second door and passed through. A dimly-lit stairway led down in front of them. About twenty-five steps brought them to the beginning of a short pa}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
sageway. At the end was another door. It was solid.
\par Zip approached the door and paused. He turned his head to the other two, lifted his eyebrows and shrugged. Mark and Joe nodded. Zip knocked. The door was opened almost immediately.
\par A good-looking, clean-shaven man with dark brown wavy hair looked them over once quickly, then stepped aside. \'93Come in,\'94 he said, waving a hand while the other held the door. \'93I\rquote m Montezuma Vly.\'94
 He had powerful hands, obviously used to hard labor. His nails had grit u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 der them. Strong as the hands were, they were also clearly the 
hands of an artist, capable of fine work. He shook hands with the Starmen as they entered.
\par \'93Wow!\'94 said Joe, the last to enter. Vly shut the door. The three Starmen gazed about them. They were standing in a small room packed with machinery\emdash old-fashioned machi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ery used for rock cutting, polishing stones, and mounting specimens. The heady smell of machine oil hung in the air, not heavy like that of an aircraft hangar but a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tractive and energi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 z}
{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing, almost like a perfume.
\par The machinery was made of cast iron, wit
h wheels and gears, rods and chains visible inside the cases. Mark noted that each machine looked lovingly maintained. The newest machine must have been at least fifty years old, but all were in top quality condition.
\par \'93They\rquote re made to be used,\'94 explained Vly, discerning their thoughts. \'93You can\rquote t get better machines than these today. The new stuff doesn\rquote t last and can\rquote t be depended on.\'94
\par Mark, the engine master of the trio, immediately thought of the precision instruments produced by Starlight Ente}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 prise. He
 opened his mouth, but said nothing. He knew that SE made quality machinery, but little of it was iron. He didn\rquote 
t want to make a fool of himself by talking about something of which he knew little. Instead he smiled and decided to take a closer look.
\par He leaned over the closest apparatus. His mild skept}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 cism quickly turned to awe. \'93My goodness, Mr. Vly! This is i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 credible! These machines are beautiful!\'94
 Vly didn\rquote t smile, but his face softened a little.
\par Joe and Zip were looking around the room. On two walls we
re hung various hand tools. Several shelves held cans of oil and paint, boxes of supplies, and dozens of samples of minerals and crystals. The other two walls were lined with books, half of them behind glass. 
\par Zip turned his head to the side to read the titles of some of the books. He saw }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 The Complete Works of William Shakespeare;}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Kon Tiki }{\fs21\insrsid3755814 by Thor Heyerdahl}{

\fs21\insrsid3755814 lurgy, engineering, and electronics. Zip\rquote s eyebrows lifted. He was impressed.
\par Mark was looking at the books on the other wall. }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Basic Watercolor,}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  he read. }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 The Stories of Edgar Allen Poe}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  was next to }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 
The Life of Johann Sebastian Bach.}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  Mark whistled. \'93Not what I expected, Mr. Vly,\'94 he said. \'93Not at all what I expected.\'94
\par \'93Uh huh,\'94 murmured Montezuma Vly. \'93Let\rquote s get down to business. Follow me.\'94 He squeezed past Zip in the crowded little workplace, passed through a narrow door on the other side of the room, and through a passageway. The Starmen followed.

\par A small furry shape leaped through the air in front of Joe. \'93Ack!\'94 exclaimed the lanky Starman, stumbling bac}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ward, knocking over a couple of small boxes as his arms flailed. Nuts and bolts scattered on the floor. Joe backed into a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 other box and sat down hard on it.
\par \'93What\emdash ?\'94 exclaimed Vly, turning.
\par \'93What was that?\'94 cried Joe. \'93Something jumped across the corridor. I think it went into this recess here.\'94 He pointed to an opening between a few stacked boxes.
\par \'93One of my koalangs,\'94 answered Montezuma. \'93I\rquote ve got four of them here. There are a few more in the living qua}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ters. Good company. They can startle you, though, and they can make an awful mess. More than once I\rquote ve threatened to make stew out of \rquote em and eat \rquote em for dinner.\'94
 The Starmen looked at one another, wondering if he was joking. His next action showed that he was.
\par \'93Come on, Howard,\'94 said Montezuma gently, bending over and calling into the dark place where the koalang had hidden. \'93They won\rquote t hurt you. I know you\rquote re not used to company, but no one\rquote s gonna hurt you. Come on out. That
\rquote s it, come on.\'94 He reached in gently and drew a small creature out of the darkness. It had a small furry face with large, frightened eyes, and snuggled up against the miner. Its fur was caramel and white. He folded it into his chest and co}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 v}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ered it gently with both hands. He crooned to it lovingly for a moment or two, then said, \'93That\rquote s right. You\rquote re okay. Go play.\'94 Then he added with mock fierc}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 ness, \'93Just stay out of the paint!\'94 He set it down and turned back to the door at the end of the co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ridor.
\par \'93In here,\'94 he directed, leading the way into the room b}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 yond.

\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing with a variety of items. Hand tools identical to those used by rock ho
unds for centuries lay on tables and on shelves. Stacks of paper, most of which showed signs of being bound by hand, covered much of the remaining space. On one shelf was a large, clear sphere on an ornately shaped stand. The eyes of all three Starmen wer
e drawn to it.

\par There were three chairs. Montezuma sat in one placed before a desk and swiveled to face his visitors. Zip and Joe took the other chairs and Mark sat on a short stack of crates filled with rock samples. A thi
ck book rested on a table in the center of the room. Mark glanced at the title, turning his head slightly to do so. It was }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 The Flying Carpet}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 , by Ric}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 h}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ard Halliburton. There was a bookmark about halfway through the book.
\par The asteroid miner leaned forward. \'93What about George?\'94 he asked.
\par Zip filled him in. Montezuma Vly paid close attention. His eyes never wavered from Zip\rquote s face as he spoke. When Zip was finished, Vly nodded.
\par \'93Mm hmm,\'94 he murmured. \'93This could be bad for George. I\rquote ll tell you where to find him. I expect that you\rquote ll be able to keep him out of the clutches of the space vu}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tures. You\rquote 
ve got an enemy to be reckoned with in this Zimbardo psychopath, but I believe you can handle him.\'94
\par \'93You seem to know a lot about our recent exploits, Mr. Vly,\'94 said Joe, conversationally.
\par \'93I\rquote m not the complete recluse people think, Mr. Taylor. People have a lot of wrong ideas about me. I don\rquote t want to be listed in the Register of Peoples, and I don\rquote 
t want people butting into my business or telling me how to live, but I keep up with the news. If I hadn\rquote t recognized you, you wouldn\rquote t have been allowed to land on my asteroid. You\rquote re not wearing Starman\rquote s red, you know.\'94

\par \'93We\rquote re grateful to you, Mr. Vly,\'94 nodded Zip.
\par \'93May I ask\emdash \'94 began Mark, then hesitated.
\par \'93Yes, you may ask. Go on.\'94
\par Mark turned his head toward the sphere. \'93The sphere\'85\'94
\par \'93Oh yes. It\rquote s pure crystal, all right.\'94
\par The Starmen gasped.}{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814  \'93Pure\'85crystal\'85?\'94}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  stammered Mark. \'93Why, there can\rquote t be a larger one in the Solar Sy}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tem! It\rquote s priceless!\'94

\par \'93Next largest was in the Smithsonian Institution, a little more than twelve inches in diameter. This one\rquote s sixteen and three-quarters inches. Found it myself on Adamant\emdash that\rquote 
s the parent asteroid from which this sliver I live on was busted off a few millennia ago.\'94 Mark knew he was refe}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ring to what he had called a \'93worthless chunk\'94 before they landed.
\par Vly went on. \'93Shaped it myself in those old machines you saw coming in here. Had to redesign some of \rquote em to fit a crystal this size, but we did it.\'94
\par \'93It looks flawless!\'94 breathed Joe.
\par \'93Looks it, but isn\rquote t. Its flaws are its greatest treasure. Watch this; you haven\rquote t seen anything yet.\'94
 Vly picked up a small cutting tool with a laser guide at the end. He turned off the lights and then pointed the laser at the crystal sphere. The beam struck the surface and then scattered throughout the interior of the globe, igniting sparks of spe}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 c}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tacular glory. Mark could feel tears come into his eyes from the unearthly beauty the light created. Many dozens of flakes, invisible to the naked eye, were re
vealed when the laser beam pierced the near-perfect sphere. They exploded in glorious colors\emdash gold, orange, deep red, flaming yellow, silver; even a few brilliant green, deep blue, and violet sparks traced across the inner world.
\par The Starmen were speechless. They couldn\rquote t take their eyes off the resplendent glory of the sphere under the laser light. \'93Beautiful, isn\rquote t it?\'94 asked Vly, gently. There was no need to answer.
\par \'93Where do the colors come from?\'94 asked Mark. \'93Laser light has only one wavelength, so it can\rquote t be refracting in there.\'94
\par \'93The crystal\rquote s impurities are almost invisible to the u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 aided eye,\'94 answered Vly, \'93but the laser hits the impurities and causes secondary emissions of light of all sorts of color\emdash 
the more impurities, the more colors. It lights up better than a fire opal.\'94
\par As he moved the laser beam slowly around the globe, the interior lights changed\emdash first one, then another \'93flaw\'94 ta}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing the light and surging into radiance.
\par All too soon, he switched off the laser and turned the room lights back on. It was almost as if a spell had been broken.
\par \'93C\rquote mon,\'94 he said. \'93I\rquote ll show you just where George is on the chart.\'94 He moved back down the hall, the Starmen fo}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
lowing. When they were back in the room they had first entered, Vly reached up into a recess where there were se}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 v}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 eral rolled sheets of paper. \'93Move aside,\'94
 he said quietly, pushing a reluctant koalang over and pulling out a large roll. He unrolled it over a rock polisher and gestured for the Starmen to take the corners. It was a map of a portion of the asteroid belt.
\par \'93Here\rquote s where we are,\'94 said Vly, pointing to a spot on the map, \'93and here\rquote s where George is.\'94 His finger swept across the map to where a tiny dot had been placed. \'93It\rquote 
s a mining operation of moderate size called Z25. He runs it there with a fair-sized crew\emdash maybe a dozen men.\'94 There were equations, sketches, and notes scribbled all over the sheet.
\par \'93I\rquote m sorry, Mr. Vly,\'94 said Mark, \'93but I don\rquote t follow you. I\rquote m used to plotting coordinates and thinking in three d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 mensions.\'94
\par \'93See these figures?\'94 asked Vly. \'93They\rquote re your coord}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 nates. It is a three-dimensional map, in a manner of spea}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing. If it weren\rquote t, I couldn

t be hard to find, once I point it out to you. I just spoke to him a few hours ago and I\rquote ll get ahold of him again and tell him you\rquote ll be coming.\'94 He began to write some notes down for Mark.
\par \'93Must take a lot of power to run your operation here, Mr. Vly,\'94 observed Mark while he waited for Montezuma to finish writing. \'93Don\rquote t you have to conserve energy?\'94
\par \'93Haven\rquote t had to conserve energy since I developed a new process for drawing energy directly from the sun.\'94
\par \'93But out here the solar radiation is so weak. You can\rquote t get much energy from solar panels, no matter how eff}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 cient\emdash certainly not enough to run your machines without some sort of supplement.
\'94
\par \'93I don\rquote t use solar panels any more, Mr. Seaton. I mine energy from the sun directly with an entirely new process. I can pull in and store about four gigawatts. Gives me all I need and plenty left over.\'94
\par \'93Four }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 giga}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 watts?\'94
\par \'93Four gigawatts. That\rquote s a four with nine zeroes after it.\'94
\par Mark almost shouted. \'93I know how much it is! Mr. Vly! You amaze me! There\rquote s nothing like that anywhere else in the Solar System!}{\b\fs21\insrsid3755814  }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Nobody}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \'93Really?\'94 said Mr. Vly, lifting his eyebrows slightly, handing him the sheet with his notes on it. \'93Excuse me a moment while I write that down, so the next time I want to turn my whole life over to lawyers and businessmen I\rquote 
ll know just what to do.\'94
\par \'93But, but\'85\'94 Mark spluttered. Joe laughed and Zip smiled.
\par \'93Thank you, Mr. Vly,\'94 said Zip, extending his hand. \'93It has been a remarkable visit, and we appreciate very much your letting us drop in.\'94
\par Montezuma shook Zip\rquote s hand. \'93Wait a minute, Starmen. Let me give you something to help you while away the long hours in space.\'94 He turned and rummaged t
hrough a box, then scanned a shelf behind him. After a moment he pulled out a gold disc in a flat, clear co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tainer.
\par \'93Take this,\'94 he said, handing it to Zip. \'93It\rquote s a recording of the entire works of Johann Sebastian Bach. That\rquote s more than 1,200 compositions. The music is so complex that some of its mysteries weren\rquote 
t even discovered until the computer age. Lily made this disk. She\rquote s an expert in the music of the Renaissance. Does research all the time.\'94
\par  \'93Lily?\'94
\par \'93Lily and I have been partners out here for over twenty years. Us and the koalangs.\'94
\par Zip put the disk into his pocket. \'93Thank you, sir. Best wishes to you.\'94
\par \'93You too. An occasional visit once in a while is we}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 come, especially when people respect my way of life. Most don\rquote t understand. I think you three do. Just protect George. He\rquote

\par 
\par About 56 hours later, the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Vigilant Warrior}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  came into the proximity of Z25. Joe eased the ship through a scattering of moderate-sized asteroids and then came into a space where there w

\par As they made their final approach, the Starmen had a good view of Z25\rquote s horizon near the time of local sunset. The surfa

cial structures was visible nearby, and several spaceships were parked in an informal array. A dome covered the buildings, and reflected the sun in a burst of brightness. Mark had a quick memory of dewdrops in the garden of h
is home on Earth when he was a child. He recalled thinking that each dewdrop held a small sun.
\par In moments the Starmen were sitting in George St. George\rquote s study. He was a man in his middle-fifties, of a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 v}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 erage height and weight, with a full head of wavy blon

\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ting out chairs, bringing in two from a room next door. \'93And please call me George.\'94
\par Once they were settled, Zip began to tell George about the pirates and Zimbardo\rquote s likely determination to find and eliminate the one man who knew where the pirates\rquote  aste}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 oid could be fou
nd. Before he got too far into the story, George lifted a hand and smiled. \'93Yes, yes, I know,\'94 he said. \'93Monty told me all about it.\'94 
\par The Starmen leaped out of their chairs, absolutely stunned. Before they had left Montezuma\rquote s Castle Zip had impressed upon Vly how vital it was for St. George\rquote 
s safety that they not communicate until his friend was safe. Zip had begged him to send just a quick, encrypted message that Z25 was to expect three visitors who had Vly\rquote s seal of a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 proval\emdash 
no more.
\par \'93George!\'94 gasped Joe. \'93That message could have been intercepted by the pirates! They }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 must}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  be looking for you!\'94
\par \'93We told Vly not to communicate with you! It could mean your life!\'94 continued Mark, suddenly heartsick with anxiety.
\par George chuckled. \'93Don\rquote t worry, Starmen! The pirates a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ready tried to find me through Monty, but the greegles pr}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tected him, and the pirates\rquote 
ll never find me without coo}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 eration from Monty\emdash which they\rquote ll never get. There\rquote s really no need to worry. We\rquote re completely safe here. We\rquote ll have dinner, you\rquote ll sta
y here to sleep, I\rquote ll show you around the operation, and you can go back to Ceres.\'94
\par The Starmen were speechless for a moment. Joe\rquote s eyes nervously scanned the room and Mark stared at George with his mouth agape. Then Zip spoke.
\par \'93What are greegles, George?\'94
\par George chuckled again. \'93You haven\rquote t heard of this \lquote a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 teroid miner\rquote s legend\rquote ? Most people think it\rquote 
s in a class with leprechauns and mermaids, the story of the greegles, but it\rquote s all true. The greegles are the inhabitants of the a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 teroids. Don\rquote t know if they\rquote re alive or not. They
\rquote re made of metal\emdash some kind of metal\emdash or maybe they just wear a metal suit. They\rquote re about a foot high. Now, don\rquote t stare at me like that; you\rquote re looking thoroughly obflisticated, prob}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 bly thinking I\rquote ve been out in the vacuum too long, but I\rquote ve seen them! They\rquote re little and they\rquote re old, very old, but they\rquote re powerful! No one can beat them! Usually no one ever sees them and they don
\rquote t have any need to interfere with human beings. They don\rquote t mind it too much, though, if a solitary asteroid miner sees them once in a while.\'94
\par \'93And wh\emdash , what do they have to do with Montezuma?\'94 asked Zip, keeping his voice steady.
\par \'93Why, a short time after you left the Castle, about five ships tried to land on the Castle by force\emdash pirates, for sure. No doubt they wanted to force Monty to tell \rquote em where I am. But Monty knows how to contact the greegles. There\rquote 
s a lot of greegles on Adamant.\'94 George chuckled again.
\par \'93Those poor fellows\emdash the pirates, that is! When the p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 rates told Monty they were going to land whether 
he wanted them to or not, why, he just called the greegles for help. They cut four of the ships into pieces in a matter of seconds, leaving the crew floating in their spacesuits. Then they grabbed them with some sort of invisible grappling beam or somethi
ng and herded them toward the fifth ship. That ship gathered them in and took off.\'94
\par Now George laughed out loud. \'93They got the message real fast! }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Go away and don\rquote t come back!}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  And they scrammed! Never even set foot on Montezuma\rquote s Castle. Monty will make good
 use of the floating space junk the pirates left. Serves \rquote em right!\'94
\par Just then a gentle buzz sounded. \'93That\rquote s the call for di}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ner, friends. Come meet the others!\'94
\par Almost immediately another sound came through the communications system\emdash an urgent clangor. St. George\rquote s face became taut and a look of surprise and anxiety came over his features.
\par \'93What\rquote s that?\'94 asked Zip.
\par \'93It\rquote s the alarm,\'94 St. George whispered. \'93It\rquote s never sounded before.\'94 The alarm abruptly shut off and an e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 x}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 cited, panic-stricken voice came through the intercom.
\par \'93Five ships approaching! Coming in fast! They\rquote re co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 m}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 manding all hands to come to the landing field and threa}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

 disturbing frequency. He hurled himself into the tiny office where a frantic young man sat at a console.
\par \tab \'93We\rquote re going to die!\'94 cried the young man. Joe looked through the large window and saw five ships hovering over the base. Their laser cannons were ra
pidly destroying the outlying parts of the mining base. There were no defensive weapons. Joe glanced at the radar screen and his hair stood up as he saw that the screen showed nothing. To the su}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \tab Joe looked out the window again and saw that laser ca}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 nons had begun to destroy the ships. Through the horrif}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 y}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

 crumpling into a heap. The other ships were either completely destroyed or well on the way.
\par \tab \'93What is this? Who are they?\'94 exclaimed Mark. He, Zip, and George had followed Joe to the control center and were watching the laser beams sweep the landing field. The ships were being indiscriminately reduced to molten slag.
\par \tab \'93Their laser beams are immensely powerful, and they\rquote re operating at full capacity,\'94 observed Zip, grimly. Just then the lights went out and every apparatus in the control center went dark.
\par \tab \'93They found and destroyed the power plant,\'94 whispered George, the tenseness evident in his voice. \'93But they\rquote re not touching the inhabited parts of the base.\'94
\par \tab Suddenly Zip turned to their host. \'93George!\'94 he said u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 gently. \'93Do any of your crew know that we are Starmen?\'94 George turned a distracted face to Zip and stared as if he wasn\rquote

\par \tab \'93Ah\emdash all right,\'94 George stammered.
\par \tab Since the power was out, there was no way to make an announcement through the communication system, but the rest of the crew was assembling anyway. The refectory
 was located not far from the control center and the men were coming together there, so the Starmen and George went to join them.
\par \tab In a moment, there were about a dozen men in the room. Some sat on the benches, others stood. There was palpable fear in the room, as if they knew that sudden, violent death was near.
\par }\pard \qj \fi216\li0\ri0\widctlpar\nooverflow\faroman\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs21\insrsid3755814 Zip asked George, \'93Is this everyone?\'94 George took a quick glance around the room.
\par \'93I, I think so, yes.\'94
\par Zip took charge. \'93Men, listen to me. We\rquote re about to be taken captive. I don\rquote t think anything worse will happen to us, or it would have happened by now. My friends and I have come to visit Sabbath George. Just got here from C}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 res and sure didn\rquote t expect this!\'94
\par George took over. He was showing more confidence now. Alone of the Z25 crew, he had never shown fear, just shock. \'93We\rquote ll just wait right here, men, and see what\rquote s next. I don\rquote 
t know who these attackers are or what they want, but don\rquote t volunteer any information of any kind. You hear me? }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 No information}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  of any kind, beyond the most b}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{

\par The men were silent and collapsed in on themselves. They were afraid, but the panic seemed to have diminished som}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
what. Outside, the five ships had landed and about twenty space-suited men had emerged. With weapons in hand, they were approaching the dome. The leader gestured to several of them, who spread out around the dome. The others r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 mained at the main airlock and waited. Their feet were spread in an attitude of defiant power.
\par \'93They want the airlock open, Mr. St. George,\'94 said the young man who had fled from the control center. His voice was dry and squeaky.
\par George said, \'93Can\rquote t open it. No controls. Those fools destroyed the power center. If they\rquote re coming in, you\rquote ll have to get your spacesuits on because the atmosphere is going to disappear. Make it quick before they blow the ai}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 lock by force.\'94 The men scattered. George and the Starmen went to the airlock and looked at the invaders from the i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
side of the dome. George said to the Starmen, \'93Of course, there\rquote s a backup power system, but I don\rquote t feel a compe}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ling need to make it any easier for these strangers.\'94
\par When the leader saw that there were people coming, he kicked the airlock savagely and aimed his weapon at the mechanism. As was customary, the helmets were lined up on a rack on shelves just inside the airlo
ck. George put on his helmet and the Starmen put on theirs. The rest of the mining crew began to show up with their suits on and found their helmets. When all were suited up and the inte}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
coms were on, George told the mining crew to stand aside. Then he told the leader of the invaders that he could enter.
\par The man fired a stupendously powerful beam at the ai}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 lock that melted it like ice in a furnace. In seconds, the air inside the dome whooshed out into the vacuum of space.
\par \'93Get into the ship,\'94 growled the leader of the invaders, indicating the closest of the five spaceships. \'93No one is g}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing to be hurt, but I\rquote m not guaranteeing that that situation will last. I
\rquote m not a patient man and I don\rquote t like wasting time.\'94
\par \'93What about our belongings?\'94 asked George.
\par \'93You won\rquote t need them. Move to the ship. Now.\'94
 The voice was even and quiet but as hard as iron. Zip started the procession. He slumped down as if completely disheartened and walked like a prisoner, his eyes pointed to the ground. The others followed. The invade
rs kept them surrounded as they walked the short distance to the pilot ship. Several i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 vaders entered first and then kept watch on the prisoners as they ascended the ladder into the staging area. Once the a}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 teroid miners were aboard, the other invaders entered their ships.
\par When the door was sealed, the invaders removed their helmets. The miners followed suit. The leader took a quick inventory of the prisoners, and then settled his gaze on George.
\par \'93You are George St. George,\'94 he said in a tone that knew he was stating a fact. \'93My name is Lather. You and your men are now prisoners of Lurton Zimbardo. I am ta}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing you to him. As long as I\rquote

\par Without turning his head, Lather addressed one of his crew. \'93Blaze, see that this base is melted into the be}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 rock.\'94
\par \'93Yes sir,\'94 said the man addressed and left the room.
\par Lather addressed another of his crew. \'93Spelford, escort the prisoners to their quarters.\'94
\par Spelford lifted his weapon and nodded in the direction they were to go. The prisoners went, under the guard of se}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 v}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 eral armed men.
\par They were taken to a room set up to accommodate up to twenty passengers. There were niches with beds in them, and couches for use during acceleration.
\par \'93Prepare for lift-off,\'94 ordered Spelford. The prisoners sat down and strapped themselves in. Spelford and his men left, locking the door behind them. In a moment the war}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ing signal for lift-off was given. The ship raised itself ge}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tly from the surface of the asteroid. The fierce glare of d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 structive laser strikes came through the 
quartz window for nearly a minute, and the prisoners knew that the living quarters of Z25 were being systematically d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 stroyed.
\par \'93They\rquote re ramsquaddling the whole operation,\'94 said Sa}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 b}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 bath George in a voice that sounded almost matter-of-fact. \'93Never had anything like this happen before. This is a first.\'94

\par The five invisible ships had been gone for over an hour, but the man in the shadow still did not move. He was on a neighboring chunk of floating iron, just a mile or two in d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ameter with a very slow rotation. St. George\rquote s asteroid would vanish below his horizon in a few minutes. The man pulled the telescope up to his face plate once again and 
scanned the area that had been the base on Z25. There had been no movement of any kind since the ships had rayed the site. He took a few more pictures for his files. The metal and quartz plating\emdash all signs of human presence\emdash 
had been completely destroyed, melted into the rock of the asteroid. The brilliant orange of superheated rock had quickly cooled in the near-absolute zero of airless space.
\par \'93Guess it\rquote s okay to go now,\'94 he thought. \'93Those space buzzards are not detail men\emdash just grab and destroy without even looking around. Lucky for me.\'94
\par The man went over to a small asteroid cruiser, built for speed in touring the Asteroid Belt. Stepping in, he sealed the airlock and pulled out a small recorder. He tuned in a co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 m}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
plicated code and began to speak.
\par \'93Steve Cliff, reporting in to Oritz Konig on Mars Base.\'94 Steve went on to give the date, time, and location, and a brief but thorough report of what he had seen, from the time the Starmen landed on Z25 to the time the pirates\rquote 
 five ships had disappeared. He added to the file the pictures he had taken, and concluded, \'93Now returning to Yellow City. If you have anything else you\rquote d like me to do, Oritz, co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

sage in three hours. Then he lifted off the small asteroid and headed toward Ceres. A few minutes after liftoff, he fired the projectile. When it sent its message, Steve Cliff would be far away and no one could trace the me
ssage back to his ship. On top of that, the message was encrypted and d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 signed to travel on the microwaves similar to those in the background of space. It was highly unlikely that this me}{

\par A quarter of an hour later, the ten men were in the lounge in Zimbardo\rquote s quarters. He was playing host, and pouring out a dark golden sherry wine into luxurious spun glass goblets.
\par One of the men lifted up the goblet so the illumination reflected from it, highlighting subtle rainbow whorls in the surface. He swirled his wine before he sipped it.
\par \'93Very nice, Lurton, and the glass here is pretty top stuff.\'94

\par The men relaxed in the comfortable chairs. The chairs automatically adjusted to the body weight and shape of whoever sat 
in them. Soft, almost imperceptible music was playing in the background. A light fragrance in the air eased tensions and sharpened minds for thought. Zimbardo had nothing to do with creating this atmosphere\emdash 
these features came on automatically whenever anyone entered the room.
\par \'93Petty soft life you got here, Zimbardo,\'94 sighed the man named Lorry, easing himself down into his chair. \'93I\rquote m not used to this kind of comfort.\'94

\par \'93Gene,\'94 said Zimbardo, turning away. He didn\rquote t like to deliver news of defeat.
\par \'93The pilots of the ships tell essentially the same story,\'94 began Gene. \'93They came directly to Montezuma\rquote

\par \'93Very good!\'94 Zimbardo\rquote s initial irritation was instantly dispelled. \'93Tell Mr. Lather to put the prisoners into the cell block. I will deal with them later.\'94 The intercom went off and Zimbardo turned back to the gathering. \'93

resolved; Zimbardo, however, was not saying ever}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 y}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
thing he suspected. He was frightened, but determined that no one would know it. He had heard of the legend of the greegles and took it more seriously than anyone would ever suspect.

\par \tab \'93Our conclusion is that, although we have 542 men in custody in Eagle City, including their captain Troy Putnam, several dozen pirates are still free. It would have taken a large facility to

 in other locations in the Asteroid Belt or elsewhere. Moreover, as you know, one ship managed to escape from Mars during the liberation. Oritz Konig, now on special assignment at Mars Base, will make a report on what we\rquote ve learned about Putnam

 Robert Nolan was a man of early middle age, slight of build, with thinning hair. He was noted for his analytical mind and incisive decisions. His hard work over a twenty-year span had built a small company into an influential co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{

\par \tab \'93This is what we are gathered here to reveal,\'94 Richard answered. \'93I\rquote m afraid the news is quite disturbing. Steve Cliff will give us his report.\'94
\par \tab By videotape, Steve Cliff reported what he had seen in the area of Z25. He concluded, \'93So it is obvious that the pirates have a very effective radar bender. Their ships are, in effect, invisible to our standard radar detection systems.\'94

Their radar bender is nearly perfect. The notion of developing a technique that makes an object invisible to radar is not new, of course, but in spite of several decades of effort even Starlight Enterprise has not been able to achieve the 
high level of effectiveness Zimbardo\rquote s men have available to them. From these obse}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 vations we draw two disquieting conclusions.
\par \tab \'93First, we learned from the pirates we captured on Mars that their base is probably invisible to radar; it can\rquote t be seen with normal methods. It\rquote s likely that the pirates have outfi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ted }
{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 all}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  their ships with the device that makes objects invis}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ble to radar, not just the five Steve Cliff observed. If so, their ships can be anywhere without the possibility of any of our bases or centers of civilization being aware of them until they become visible to the eye. Since all our co}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 m}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 puters track ships and contribute toward strategic battle decisions based on radar data, it is almost impossible to guard against such p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 rate raids as Zimbardo
\rquote s men are now able to carry out\emdash and have already done on Z25.\'94 Richard sighed.
\par }\pard \qj \fi216\li0\ri0\widctlpar\nooverflow\faroman\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs21\insrsid3755814 \'93Second, and most alarming of all, it is almost imposs}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ble for the pirates to have invented the radar bender on their own. We had surmised this shortly after our first convers}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ti
ons with the captive pirates on Mars, but since then our computer has estimated the chance that they did so to be approximately 0.0001%. That kind of technology is beyond any earthly scientific capability. It is much more likely that they got it from some
 alien civilization\emdash a highly advanced alien civilization.
\par \'93We don\rquote t have any solid information other than that, so we can only guess what level of connection there may be between any such hypothetical civilization and the pirates. At any rate, where the radar bender came from, other d}{

\par The room was silent. Everyone was stunned. When Mars was liberated they had thought that the conflict was at an end. Now they saw that their situation was more desperate than they thought possible.
\par After a moment, Robert Nolan spoke up. His eyes were wide and his voice was high-pitched. \'93Wh\emdash , what can we do? Can\rquote t we find these pirates? Can\rquote t we just send out ships and comb the entire area of the Belt where they di}{

 he is still in the wrong. Evil might have its day, but in the end it will always fall; the forces of light will overcome it as it decays from within. With that faith and that assurance, we can make our plans. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how we ca

 Zip, looking intently at the asteroid miner and drawing him over to the nearest table. Zip gently eased the miner into a chair, then turned another chair around and sat in it, folding his arms over its back and facing George. The asteroid miner told the 
Starmen the story of his discovery of the a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 teroid and how Troy Putnam had learned about it. They had already heard a brief version of the story from Oritz Konig back at Mars Base.

\par \'93Good work, Mark, but let\rquote s not waste time! We\rquote re in a hurry now,\'94 urged Zip. \'93What do you see in there Joe?\'94 By now George and several of his men had come over and were watching over the shoulders of the Starmen.
\par \'93Yeah, really simple circuit. I can disconnect it in a mi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ute even without tools and we can be out the door.\'94 Joe reached in.
\par \'93Wait!\'94 Zip grabbed Joe\rquote s wrist. \'93Is there any evidence that the circuit is tied into a larger system, like a master computer, that would tip anyone off that the door has been opened?\'94
\par Joe peered into the aperture and carefully traced the wi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing.
\par \'93Sorry, Zip. Sorry, everybody,\'94 he said, chagrined. \'93You\rquote re right. There is. But I can fix that too.\'94 He reached in and twisted two wires together. \'93Okay, that should b}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 y}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
pass the door circuit and tell the master computer that the door is still closed. I can open the door now. Are you ready?\'94
\par Zip stood up. \'93There are fourteen of us. We don\rquote t know where to go once we\rquote re free, so I\rquote d like George to lead us. He\rquote s been through the asteroid. Take us somewhere, George, where we won\rquote t be found easily.\'94
\par George shook his head in a big arc. \'93Now Zip, I haven\rquote t been on this chunk for over fifteen years. I\rquote m not real sure where to go!\'94
\par \'93George, no one else has been on the asteroid at all. There\rquote s no one but you.\'94
\par The asteroid miner looked down, dejected. \'93I don\rquote t like any of this. But you\rquote re right. Okay. We\rquote ll go out the door and back to the elevators. We\rquote ll take the one on the left. I\rquote 
ll take us to a floor one level down, then through a huge stor}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 room. On the other side are other corridors. I\rquote ve been through there, and there are places to hide and more elev}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{

\par \'93Everyone got that?\'94 said Zip. \'93Stay together and move quickly.\'94 No one had anything else to say. Zip turned to Joe.
\par \'93Let\rquote s go,\'94 decreed Zip. Joe removed one end of a black wire and touched it to another terminal. The door slid open.
\par Outside was a scene that none of the Starmen had e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 x}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 pected. Two pirates, dressed in their gray and black un}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
forms, were seated opposite one another at a small table on the far side of the corridor. The one on the right was a well-muscled, large man with dark hair, weighing well over 200 pounds; 
the other was blond, of medium build. He was leaning on his elbow, pondering his next move in a board game. When the door slid open, they both looked up, utter surprise written over their faces.
\par Both the Starmen and the pirates froze for a split second, th
en both sides moved at once. Mark charged for the big man and Joe for the blond. Simultaneously the huge pirate bellowed and threw the table toward the charging Starmen, scattering the game pieces. Mark stopped the flying table without slowing his pace an
d slammed it hard back at the pirates, legs first. The blond man managed to evade the t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ble, but the big pirate took two table legs on his left thigh and upper chest. He groaned, and the laser pistol he had been drawing was caught behind the table. Mark quickly threw the table upside-down to his left, reached with both hands for the pirate
\rquote s right arm, and pulled the man quickly down and toward himself. His right knee came up and caught the man in the solar plexus. The pirate went down with a whoosh of air and lay still. Mark picked up his pi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 tol.
\par Meanwhile, the blond pirate had screamed for help in a panicky voice, turned, and was dashing down the corridor toward the elevators. Joe took hold of the table\rquote s leg nea}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
est him and skated the table forcefully down the corridor after the escaping pirate. It caught the man behind his left ankle as he was running. In the low gravity, the pirate turned a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
most completely over, his pistol flying. Joe caught up with him and delivered a quick punch that rendered the man u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 conscious. The entire fight had taken less than ten seconds.
\par Zip stepped into the corridor calmly. \'93Did either of them have a chance to set off an alarm?\'94
\par \'93I think this one did,\'94 responded Joe, pointing to the fallen pirate at his feet and picking up his laser pistol. \'93He had about five seconds while he was running to send an emergency call.\'94
\par Zip grimaced. \'93That was stupid. I should have thought that they would have a guard. I just didn\rquote t think of it, with all the electronic gadgetry around here and their obvious need of manpower. My fault. Sloppy thinking. But it\rquote 
s worse to stand here and feel badly about it. We\rquote ve got to disappear fast.\'94
\par \'93This way!!\'94 shouted George and began to run toward the elevator. The asteroid miner who had previously been so sedate and hesitant now led the way. The Starmen fo}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
lowed him and the ten others brought up the rear. George reached the elevator door and pressed the panel. In seconds a door opened and the men hurried in. Just as the last man rushed through the opening and the doors began to close, the el}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 vator doors in the next shaft opened and a troop of pirates poured out, guns drawn. In front of them they saw their two comrades lying motionless in the corridor, table and chairs in full disarray.
\par \'93Come on!\'94 commanded their leader, leaping forward and turning toward his men to enforce his order. His eyes opened wide as he saw the doors of the adjacent elevator closing on the escaped prisoners. The Starmen\rquote 
s last view of the scene was the pirate leader\rquote s shocked face, mouth agape, pulling his laser pistol up to fire. Then their doors sealed and they began to descend.

Almost instantly, it seemed, the door opened. The only light came from the interior of the elevator. It shone on an uncountable number of enormous crates, stacked th

\par \tab Suddenly Zip grabbed the laser pistol that Joe was carr}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 y}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \tab \'93Follow me,\'94 directed George. He led the procession to the right of the elevator shafts. On one side was a blank wall at least 25 feet high. On the other were row upon row of crates. Each box had a mark on it, but none of the Sta}{

\par \tab George St. George was hurrying, leading the band of fourteen onward. There was no opportunity for convers}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tion, but Mark stepped up close to Zip, who had taken the last position in the march.
\par \tab \'93Think what this place is, Zip!\'94 the mystically-oriented Starman breathed, his eyes alight with excitement. \'93This was made by an intelligent, extra-terrestrial race we\rquote ve never heard of! The Titanians certainly didn\rquote

\par \tab \'93Yes\emdash and above all, what else will we find in here?\'94
\par \tab Just then the screech of tortured metal sounded loudly throughout the chamber. Everyone turned and stared back at the elevators, where the sound was coming from. A spot on the left door of the central
 elevator began to glow red, then orange, then white. Iridescent metal began to spew forth in chunks. Then a spherical mechanism about the size of a basketball shot through the hole. A few bright green and yellow lights the size of small coins lit up its 
dull silver surface.

\par \tab \'93Zzap. Zzap,\'94 he heard again, more distant this time. He came to the end of the aisle and had to slow to keep from slamming into the wall in front of him. He reached out his left hand and grabbed the corner of a crate to help him ex}{

\par \'93Part one, the least risky part, successful,\'94 said Zip. \'93Let\rquote s get going on part two, right now. Joe?\'94
\par \'93Ready Zip,\'94 the lanky Starman responded. He stepped through the airlock and leaped off the iron surface of the asteroid toward the derelict. Powered by small jets of ox}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 y}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \'93Everyone else get busy,\'94 called Zip. They ran back through the airlock to the hangar.
 The others were already aboard their escape craft. Zip piloted it through the airlock and kept the ship close to the surface of the asteroid. The airlock closed behind them. In the meantime Joe had caused the damaged ship to drift back down toward the as
teroid out of radar range. He and Zip brought the two ships together and made a link. Joe left the broken ship and joined the ot}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 h}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ers.
\par \'93Ready, Zip\'94 he announced, once he was aboard. Zip put the slightest possible power into the escape ship, then turned the power off. Both ships began to drift away from the a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
teroid, so slowly as to be almost unnoticeable. Zip was hoping that when the pirates saw the blip on their r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 dar, they would conclude it was the derelict and pay no attention. He was ready to drift for as

\par Lurton Zimbardo shut off the microphone in the control center of the asteroid. A crowd of at least forty men jammed the center where Zimbardo sat at the console. The rest of the pirates were standing in the factory or at their assi

\par When the cheers had died down at last, Zimbardo said simply but so that all could hear, \'93And now for the last step in the plan.\'94
 The room was quiet. He took out a set of notes from his pocket. The paper was marked with scrawls, lines, and columns of figures. His eyes flicked rapidly from the notes to the controls. His fingers began to fly over the ke}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 y}{

\par Gene, Zimbardo\rquote s closest associate, was watching. Gradually his smile narrowed. His eyebrows creased. Then his eyes widened and his face drained.

 after the other. Then just before the tidings that the plant near Eagle City had been demolished, the message from the missing Starmen had come into Starlight Enterprise. The euphoria with which that word had been received was quickly dampened by the ult
imatum Lurton Zimbardo had issued.
\par \tab In words similar to those Troy Putnam had used weeks earlier, Zimbardo demanded control of Earth\rquote s wealth and resources, with specific demands for access to Earth\rquote s coded defense mechanisms, authority over major ports of 
travel, and power over the major decision-making pro}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 c}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 esses and information systems. He closed his threat with the chilling announcement that he had already directed a sheathed aste}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{

\par \tab \'93Thank you, Mr. President. My team and I have been working around the clock for eight days to develop a sy}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

velop, but the method provided somewhat of a challenge. We have now designed a technique for locating a body as small as, very roughly, two-thirds the size of the average spac}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \'93We must manufacture millions of tiny probes and r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 lease these into space in a systematic fashion over m
any millions of cubic miles. Their design is quite simple. The laboratories and manufacturing centers of organizations like Starlight Enterprise, Nolan Mining Enterprise, and other companies can create these probes in vast quantities very quickly, using r
obotic techniques. Each probe will have gravity instrumentation. Using the microwaves nat}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
rally occurring in space, they will be connected by a vast neural network and thus act as a single instrument, with all data being fed back to various information centers.
\par \'93With the data from these probes we should be able to detect any massive objects in places where they shouldn\rquote 
t be. Certainly a large asteroid cannot be hidden. The very size of the asteroid with which Zimbardo threatens our planet will work in our fa
vor, since detecting such a large object can be achieved easier and sooner than if he sent, for example, a number of small asteroids such as those that struck Mars.\'94
\par \'93Where will the probes be deployed, Dr. Hoshino?\'94 asked Richard. \'93Our time is short, very 
short indeed, if we have to manufacture, launch, and deploy the probes in time to locate and then destroy the asteroid. Even if we produce millions of probes, as you have said, we have millions of cubic miles of space to search through. In the time avai}{

\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 formation the Starmen provided confirms what we had learned through our investigations.
\par \'93Of course, our figures are somewhat imprecise, and we still have a lot of searching to do, but we have an excellent chance of locating him. It is highly logical that the astero
id he harnessed is from a place in the Belt close to his own asteroid. From what the Starmen reported, he just didn\rquote 
t have time to locate an asteroid as large as he claims to have launched toward Earth from any place too distant from his own base. The prob
es will therefore be cast in a net in the space between Earth and the area of the Asteroid Belt in which the pirates\rquote  asteroid was found.\'94

\par When deployment was complete, the entire screen was filled with a complex pattern of golden points, like dawn-illuminated mist hanging in a huge spider\rquote s web.

 code on his communication system. Then he prepared another audi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 disk, making a brief report of the luncheon meeting at Sta}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 light 
Enterprise. He played it through twice, making changes until he felt comfortable with the message. Then he speeded it up so that the complete message lasted 0.027 seconds, encrypted it, inserted the disk into his personal co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 m}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 puter, and transmitted it. After the message had been sent, he destroyed the disk and removed all signs on his computer that the action had o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 c}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 curred.
\par He stared out the window at the third planet, a beautiful blue and white globe, thinking nothing in particular. After a moment he stretched out and tried to take a nap. But he couldn\rquote t sleep.
\par 
\par A red light pulsed rapidly on the console near Lurton Zimbardo\rquote s chair. Seeing the flash from the corner of his eye, he jerked his head around and stared at it as if he couldn\rquote t believe that it was lit.
\par \'93What\rquote s this?\'94 he thought. \'93There\rquote s no message due now.\'94 He pressed the button that deactivated the light, placed headphones on, dialed a few knobs on the console, and pressed \'93Play.\'94
\par Fifteen seconds later he leaped up from his chair and be}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 lowed. With 
both hands he jerked the headphone cord out of the control panel. The wires whipped through the air with a noise like a scourge. Zimbardo twirled, his eyes bulging, and flung the headphones from him with all his force. The set flew through the command cen
ter and co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
lided with the opposite wall. Everyone in the room froze and turned to look at the pirate leader, and were appalled at what they saw. He was trembling with demonic fury. No one moved or said a word. Even Gene was afraid to speak.
\par \'93They found us!!\'94 Zimbardo shouted. \'93}{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 They found us!}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  The Earthmen know where we are! They\rquote

\par Zimbardo jumped back into his chair. \'93Gene! }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 GENE!!\'94}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  He screamed like a man possessed.}{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 
\par }{\fs21\insrsid3755814 \'93Right here sir,\'94 said the young man, coming up quickly to the pirate leader\rquote s side.
\par \'93Crank up all the power this asteroid can give me! I\rquote m going to create the biggest electromagnetic pulse this Solar System has ever seen, and }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 BURN every last one of those probes out of the void!! }{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \'93But sir,\'94 pleaded Gene, almost desperately. \'93That would take a lot of power! It would be highly inefficient and might work against us! I don\rquote t know the power capa}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 c}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ity of t

\par Zimbardo stopped moving for a moment, then turned his head very slowly around and stared at Gene. His eyes glinted with an unearthly light.
\par \'93Do it,\'94 he hissed.
\par Gene stepped back half a pace, then pivoted swiftly and ran to the power breakers on the far side of the room. He began to pull switches, override safety indicators, and turn power dials to maximum output.
\par In a little less than three minutes, he turned and looked back at Zimbardo. The pirate leader had not taken his eyes off of his assistant for a second. With his mouth slightly open, Gene looked into Zimbardo\rquote 
s eyes from across the room and nodded with a quick jerk of his head. Zimbardo smiled, inclined his head slowly, and turned back to his co}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 sole. He laughed out loud and pressed the switch that act}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 vated a general direction EMP.
\par There was a deafening sound like that of a huge metal block falling to the floor and then grinding along an uneven surface. A wailing screech filled the room and everyone but Zimbardo covered his ears. The screech increased in inte}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n
}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 sity until men fell to the floor and writhed, pressing their hands firmly to the sides of their heads. Then there was su}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
den silence and the lights went out. Men began to moan, and someone\rquote s voice quavered: \'93The atmosphere recycler has stopped!\'94
\par \'93}{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Everything}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  has stopped,\'94 said Gene from the dar}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ness.
\par 
\par Twelve Firewasps came upon the eighteen pirate ships with a suddenness that took the pirates completely by su}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 prise. The small spacecraft moved so quickly that the p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 
rates could get off only wild shots that never came close to any of the SE craft. The Firewasps used narrow but highly dense laser weaponlight with remarkable effectiveness. Skilled pilots and marksmen quickly disabled the pirate ships by pierc
ing their power supply, effectively casting them adrift in space. The pirates\rquote  sheathing systems went down, re}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 dering the ships visible. 
\par The battle was over in less than two minutes. Captain Mary Marks-Owens and Richard Starlight received the news within minutes of each other, that the eighteen pirate ships were derelicts and their crews would no doubt be e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 ger to be picked up by the nearest Space Command ships. Without power, their air would not last more than twenty-four hours.
\par Richard and Commander Lewis made the next order jointly. With a few exceptions, all Starlight Enterprise and Space Command spacecraft were to journey to the pirates\rquote 
 asteroid at once and prepare for battle. They would bring the attack directly to Lurton Zimbardo.
\par After issuing the order, Richard reset his communication system to contact the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Star Ranger}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
. Now that the need for secrecy was past, he wanted to bring the returning Starmen up to date and urge them to come to the pirates\rquote  asteroid with the others.
\par Inside the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Star Ranger}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 , Mark cried out, \'93Hey! Listen to this!\'94 He directed the communication system to public a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
nouncement mode and restarted the message from Richard Starlight. In exultant tones, Richard related the events of the previous two days, concluding with the capture of the eigh}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
een pirate ships and the coming attack on Zimbardo\rquote s aste}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 oid.
\par The Starmen cheered. They all jumped up and danced. After a moment, Zip asked, \'93How soon can we get to the asteroid, Mark?\'94
\par Mark sat down and quickly figured. \'93We\rquote re only about a day and a half away.\'94
\par \'93What are we waiting for?!\'94 exclaimed Joe.
\par \'93Let\rquote s go!\'94 said Zip. \'93We could use a little diversion on our way back to Earth.\'94
\par Mark set a new course and Joe initiated it. The }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Star Ranger}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  turned slightly to intercept the asteroid where they had been imprisoned nearly three weeks before.
\par 
\par As the power system aboard that same asteroid screeched into disruption and then silence, a massive ele}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 c}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
tromagnetic shock wave was dispensed from its surface. A great pulse of destruction moved through space at the speed of light. Although it was not strong enough to harm spac}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 craft, the m}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 crowave probes were no match for its power. As the pulse swept past the probes, they winked out in flashes of golden light.
\par On the master screen aboard the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Tempest}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  and in Richard Starlight\rquote s office, viewers watched the golden net disa}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
pear. Although it was past midnight, Richard and John Rwakatare were wide awake with their eyes glued to the screen. From the center where the asteroid was indicated, an expanding circle of darkness went forth, gradually swa}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 lowing up all the probes. It was obvious to Richard that the microwave net was doomed.
\par \'93Computer,\'94 he said in a dull voice. \'93How much longer until the net disappears?\'94
\par \'93Four minutes, twelve seconds,\'94 came the mellow voice.
\par \'93The eighteen ships are adrift,\'94 Richard said. \'93We can\rquote t lose them. But if this asteroid is maneuverable, as it must be, Zimbardo can speed up, slow down, or change course and avoid our attack. He can di}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 appear.\'94
\par Richard\rquote s body tensed and he raised his voice. \'93How did he know about the probes?!\'94 he exclaimed, with exasper}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tion.
\par \'93The spy,\'94 responded John Rwakatare.
\par 
\par Aboard the pirates\rquote  asteroid, power was returning. An emergency backup system had kicked in, causing the lights to flicker back on and the atmosphere recycler to hum qu}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
etly back into efficiency. With covert glances back at Zi}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 m}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 bardo, the men returned to their stations.
\par Zimbardo barked out a command.
\par \'93Status report!\'94
\par \'93Right away, sir,\'94 said Gene, taking his own seat. He a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tended to various dials and incoming signals.
\par Zimbardo stood up and walked over to the great window that overlooked the huge rocket pad outside. There were seven ships left\emdash six belonging to the independent smu}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 g}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
glers, Jeff Jenner, Lorry, and Captain Kimball, and his own personal ship, the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Tartarus}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 . Even the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Silver Spear}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
 had been taken by Lorry. The asteroid was nearly empty of men; only his support crew, the smugglers and their crews, and a few others remained.
\par \'93Sir,\'94 spoke up Gene. His voice trembled. He spoke as one apologizing. \'93Mr. Zimbardo. Mr. Lather sent in a fra}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
tic message that all eighteen ships were under attack. The transmission was cut off in mid-sentence. I scanned their location, sir, and detected three large Space Command ships approaching our convoy. They are about to be ca}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 p}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 tured, sir.\'94
\par Zimbardo turned slowly and looked at Gene without a change in expression. \'93And?\'94 he said. \'93There\rquote s more, I can tell. And\'85\'94
\par \'93And there is a large fleet of ships belonging to Space Command and Starlight Enterprise converging on our loc}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tion. 
In less than three hours, fourteen ships will be arriving within minutes of each other. Approximately the same number again will join them over the next twenty-four hour period.\'94 Gene hesitated, then decided to deliver the last se}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tence. \'93Even if we are sheathed, sir, with that many ships so close, they will be able to find us before long.\'94
\par Lurton Zimbardo turned his eyes obliquely to the floor and joined his hands behind his back. He rocked for a m}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ment on his feet, almost as if pondering a challenging ph}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 losophical question.
\par \'93I see,\'94 he said at last. He walked quietly over to his console, sat for a moment without moving, then began to move dials and enter numbers into the navigational pr}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
gram. He consulted various tables of information and r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ferred to a number of measuring devices whose sensitive detectors were on the surface of the asteroid.
\par Minutes passed. Zimbardo grew increasingly agitated as he worked. His men had stopped their own work and watched him. Where his hands had begun to move gently and carefully, they began to exhibit higher and higher d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 grees of animation. Soon he was pressing his keyboard v}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 hemently and muttering under his breath. Once in a while he chortled.
\par Finally he shouted, \'93Hah! That will do it! I won\rquote t be ou}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 smarted!\'94 He pressed the \'93Enter\'94 button and then roared, \'93Yes! I win!\'94 He leaped from his chair and lifted up both arms. \'93
I win!\'94 he screamed.
\par As the program Zimbardo had activated was engaged, the power it required began draining the emergency r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 sources of the asteroid. The lights dimmed and the usual hum of the atmosphere recycler began to stutter.

\par \'93What did you do?\'94 Gene asked with trepidation. \'93Even the backup power system is being strained.\'94
\par \'93Just keeping a promise,\'94 said Zimbardo jovially. \'93I told Earth I had sent them an asteroid. I wasn\rquote t very truthful at the time, I\rquote 
m afraid. But now I have kept my promise. I have redirected the asteroid so that it will collide with the planet! \emdash and I\rquote ve pushed the acceleration up to full!\'94
\par A soul-wrenching moan escaped from Gene\rquote s lips. He stumbled over to his chair and collapsed into it. He stared ahead, seeing nothing. The other men were frozen in their places.
\par Zimbardo strolled over to the wall-screen that provided a map of the Inner Planetary system and indicated their pos}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tion. With t
he power drain, the images were going in and out of focus and numbers were fading from the screen.
\par \'93Hmm. About ten days to impact,\'94 he muttered. \'93Can\rquote t tell for sure with the images fading like this, but no matter. By that time we\rquote ll be long gone.\'94
\par  A few minutes later the insides of the complex began to screech as they had before. The screech did not rise in i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
tensity but gradually turned into a groan. The light slowly faded and then went out completely.
\par  \'93The power is out for good now!\'94 Gene wailed. \'93and we\rquote re prisoners on the asteroid! Now it\rquote s a runaway! We can\rquote t stop it!\'94
\par \'93Why would we want to stop it? We\rquote ll take the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Tartarus}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  and leave to fight again another day! Pack up, get the men, and let\rquote s go. We\rquote ve got less than three hours, I think you said.\'94

\par Panicked, Gene fled from the room, feeling his way de}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 perately through the darkness. \'93I\rquote ve got to warn Kimball, Lorry, and Jenner! We\rquote ve got to escape!\'94 Fear unlike an}{

\par \tab \'93Gene! Gene! Where are you?\'94 came the voice of Lurton Zimbardo from far behind him. Startled, Gene quickly whirled and peered into the darkness. From far away came a sound as of scurrying feet. There were men coming\emdash

longings until he found his own flashlight. Without turning it on yet, he ran from the room and hastened farther away from the control center.
\par \tab \'93Gene? Gene! Is that you?\'94 came the voice of Lurton Zimbardo. Gene inhaled quickly and looked back. There was still no light. He hesitated for a moment, then a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 swered,

arious other items. Seeing there was no one else inside, he shut the door, crawled under a cab}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 net, and turned off his light.
\par After a short while, he felt the floor tremble slightly. He knew that a spaceship had lifted off. It was followed quickly by five others. \'93The smugglers are gone,\'94 he thought. \'93Just one more now. If I hear one more, I\rquote ll know that he
\rquote s gone.\'94 He waited, desperately hoping he wouldn\rquote t hear the sound of the door opening.
\par 
\par After they left Gene, the smugglers Kimball, Lorry, and Jenner q
uickly gathered together their men and supplies and headed for the airlock to the launching pad. There were thirty-seven men altogether. All had their spacesuits on and most of them carried lights.
\par \'93How are we going to get out of here?\'94 asked one of the men as they approached the airlock. \'93The airlock won\rquote t open. Nothing\rquote s working.\'94
\par \'93Portable power pack,\'94 said Kimball. He took a small box from another man, set it down by the airlock, and in seconds had established a makeshift connection. The ai}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 lock opened.
 In that fashion, the men boarded their ships without delay.
\par Kimball lifted off first and entered the vast, stone tunnel that led to the outside. As soon as the enormous airlock b}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 came visible down the shaft, he fired a laser cannon at it. Unable to resist
 an attack from within, the great door, tho}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 sands of years old, shattered into fragments. The atmo}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par None of the men said anything to each other, but sca}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 tered, each going to his own quarters.
\par Ten minutes later, arrayed in his spacesuit and carrying a few items, Lurton Zimbardo stood at the great doors. B}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 hind him was the asteroid complex. In front was the man}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 u}{

 stood in solitary splendor. Only five men had joined the pirate leader.
\par \'93So,\'94 said Zimbardo. \'93Only five of you. Five men left. Who are you?\'94 He lifted his light a little so he could see their faces. \'93Ah, Mr. Gebbeth. I said before that I knew I could depend on you. I\rquote 
ve always known it. You are the pilot. And Mr. Slant. Mr. Stagnum. Mr. Withers. And Mr. Poppy. No one else. Well, then, there are six of us alt}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 gether. Let us go.\'94
\par There was almost no talking. Each man seemed to know what to do without being told. They opened the airlocks to pass through the manufacturing center, and then into the airless launching pad. Without haste but without unnece}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 sary delay, they entered the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Tartarus}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 , a gleaming silver and red ship that could support a crew of eighteen.
\par The six men strapped themselves into acceleration couches with Gebbeth in the pilot\rquote s position. \'93Take us out, Mr. Gebbeth,\'94 said Zimbardo. \'93I will tell you where to go when we are free.\'94
\par \'93Yes sir,\'94 said Gebbeth, and initiated the launching s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 quence. In a short time, Lurton Zimbardo\rquote s spacecraft had left the asteroid.
\par \'93Top speed, Mr. Gebbeth,\'94 said Zimbardo. \'93Make sure the sheathing equipment is functioning. Head away from the sun.\'94
\par \'93Of course, sir.\'94
\par 
\par When Zimbardo burned out the asteroid\rquote s power, much of the energy needed to power its sheathing apparatus di}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
appeared. The sheathing plates then only received power through the solar energy panels, and they did not provide enough energy to hide the asteroid completely. It appeared on radar as a faint
 blip, allowing the Earth ships to locate it without difficulty. About two hours after Zimbardo\rquote s d}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 parture, the fleet command ship }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Tempest}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
 came upon the a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 teroid. It was the first of fourteen ships from both Space Command and Starlight Enterprise that were expected to arrive within the hour.
\par The }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Tempest}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  maneuvered carefully through the gaping orifice left when Kimball\rquote s ship had blown the massive ai}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
lock, and set down inside the airless docking arena of the asteroid. Captain Mary Marks-Owens descended the ladder first, followed by several members of the crew. All were armed. Only the lights of the spaceship lit up the cavernous hall of shadows.

\par \'93Eerie,\'94 observed Captain Marks-Owens as she set foot on the pavement. \'93Follow me. We\rquote ll see if the place is as abandoned as it looks.\'94 Nine space-suited figures fell in behind her as she approached the airlock into the manufa}{

irlock, and allowed the landing party to enter the complex. Once inside, the members of the crew were able to dispense with their helmets.
\par Slowly and carefully they made their way through the blackness, pushing it back with the radiance of the lights they carried. They were in awe of the huge, obviously alien place.
\par \'93The place feels almost haunted,\'94 observed one man in a quiet voice.
\par \'93Somewhat,\'94 agreed the Captain, \'93but there\rquote s more to it than that. There\rquote s something deeper. I don\rquote t think this is an evil place. It is a place that needs to be cleansed.\'94
\par The party passed through the great doors. Before they had crossed the courtyard a man emerged from the far side, ca}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 rying a light. The members of the landing party quickly spread out, and the Captain ordered, 
\'93Halt!\'94
\par \'93Don\rquote t shoot!\'94 came the voice from behind the tiny light across the room. \'93I\rquote m unarmed. I\rquote ve been waiting for you.\'94
\par \'93Who are you?\'94
\par \'93My name is Gene Newman. I was the control officer for Lurton Zimbardo. He\rquote s gone.\'94
\par \'93Come forward slowly, hands up.\'94 Gene walked forward cautiously with his hands extended over his head, holding his light in one hand. When he was a few yards away, Ca}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
tain Marks-Owens ordered him to stop and directed two men to search him. When it was definite that he was u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 armed, she called him to approach her.
\par \'93What\rquote s been going on here?\'94 she asked.
\par Gene explained that Zimbardo had aimed the asteroid at Earth, burned out the power system, and fled two hours ea}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 lier. The Captain\rquote s face paled as he told the story.
\par \'93Radio the ships that are still en route and have them check the course of this rock,\'94 she ordered one of the men, who put on his helmet and contacted the ship. \'93And tell Mr. Madera to come here at once.\'94 The order was given.
\par While they were waiting for Mr. Madera, Captain Marks-Owens quizzed Gene further. \'93Why did you stay behind?\'94
\par \'93I\emdash , I joined Putnam\rquote s organization because it seemed a sure thing. He was captured, but Zimbardo took over and made it seem an even better proposition. But I could see him getting crazier and crazier! I\rquote 
m not ashamed to say that he began to frighten me\emdash and he frightened others, too! And when he aimed the asteroid toward Earth\'85\'94 Gene\rquote s eyes widened and he began to tremble, \'93I knew there was som}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 thing seriously wrong with him! I had to get away! I wanted to fix things\emdash if I could!\'94
\par \'93Are there any others here?\'94
\par \'93I don\rquote t know. There may be. I haven\rquote t seen anyone else. Apart from Zimbardo and the smugglers, there were seve}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 teen men left on the asteroid. I don\rquote 
t know how many went with him. There were also some prisoners\emdash three Starmen and some asteroid miners, but they escaped from the room where they were being held and disappeared into the depths of the asteroid. I don\rquote 
t know where they are now. We never saw a trace of them after that.\'94
\par \'93They escaped from the asteroid three weeks ago. In fact, we expect them to arrive here soon in their own ship.\'94
\par Gene\rquote s face showed out-and-out surprise at this news. \'93They }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 escaped?}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  They got off the asteroid? How did they do that?\'94
\par At this point, they were joined by the young man for whom the Captain had asked. He was about thirty years old, with a full crown of thick brown hair and deep brown eyes. This was Jesus Madera-Cruz, Chief Ioneer for Sta}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 light Enterprise. He was adept with engines and m}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 cro-electronics. Noted for a plac
id nature, nothing ever seemed to bother him, and his expertise in power systems had never failed the trust which Richard Starlight had placed in him.
\par \'93You asked for me, Captain?\'94 he asked.
\par \'93Yes, Mr. Madera. We need your skills urgently. This is Gene, one of Zimbardo\rquote 
s men. Zimbardo has been gone for two hours. Gene tells us that before he fled he burned out the power. Before the power went out, he also redirected the asteroid on a collision course with Earth. I\rquote ve asked our ships outside to confirm that. I
n the meantime, I\rquote d like you to check out the power system and see if you can bring it back up. Obviously, if what Gene says is true, this is a ma}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 t}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ter of extreme urgency, not just co}{
\fs21\insrsid3755814 n}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 venience.\'94
\par \'93Yes, ma\rquote am,\'94 answered the man with a brief nod. The Captain detailed several men to go with Gene and Madera to wherever Zimbardo\rquote s former chief control officer wanted to take them. Gene took them first to the control deck.
\par Captain Marks-Owens detailed the rest of her men to search the complex in pairs. As other ship
s landed, minutes apart from each other, she directed their crews to the search. After an hour, ten other pirates had been located. All had been eager to turn themselves in. They were taken into ca}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 p}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
tivity and led to one of the Space Command ships where they were fed and kept under guard.
\par Soon there were over a hundred men searching the faci}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
ity. Operations officers began connecting portable power systems to various parts of the complex to reestablish the lights and get the airlocks working again. The atmosphere recycling system was not yet accessible, but the air would last for a long time.

\par An ensign brought a report to Captain Marks-Owens during the search, confirming Gene\rquote s account that the a}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 s}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 teroid was on a collision course with Earth.
\par \'93Details?\'94 asked the Captain.
\par \'93The asteroid will collide with Earth in approximately eight days, at a speed of nearly 300,000 miles per hour,\'94 responded the ensign. \'93It was vastly accelerated for a few minutes before the power burned out, and the sun\rquote 
s gravity continues to increase the rate of acceleration. We have not yet determined precisely where it will strike, but we are forwarding the data to SE and that will be dete}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 mined.\'94
\par At that point, Gene and Madera came up to Marks-Owens.
\par \'93Captain,\'94 said Madera. \'93I have made a preliminary e}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 x}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 amination of the control system. Gene has been more than cooperative, I am happy to say. With his help, just by loo}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 k}{

storing the power, however, will not be easy. Gene has never been to the power plant. In fact, it seems that no one has, even including Zimbardo. No one knows where it is or how to learn its location.\'94
\par \'93Go back to the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Tempest}{\fs21\insrsid3755814  and contact George St. George and the Starmen. St. George is on Ceres and the Starmen are in the }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Star Ranger}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par \'93Yes ma\rquote am.\'94 Madera bowed his head slightly and turned toward the airlock that led out to the launching pad. He showed no signs whatever of being ruffled. In sharp contrast, Gene was visibly anxious.
\par \'93Gene,\'94 said Captain Marks-Owens; \'93you\rquote ve apparently been eager to cooperate. Mr. Madera is easy to get along with but hard to please. If he commends you, I am satisfied that you are not a threat to us. You go on to the }{

\par \tab The catwalk led for about a mil

\par \tab The walker opened the top of the box and peered inside. He raised a small communicator to his lips and spoke into it. After receiving a reply, he reached into the box with a long tool.

\par \tab \'93Yes sir, Mr. Madera.\'94
\par \tab \'93Let\rquote s go, Mark.\'94 The big Starman stepped up next to

aunted him.
\par \tab \'93It doesn\rquote t depend entirely on you, Mark,\'94 said Madera, appearing to read Mark\rquote s mind. \'93Now let\rquote s power up.\'94
\par \tab Mark felt the anxiety drain away. He pressed the power button he had discovered before, when the Starmen had been escaping from the pi

\par }\pard \qj \fi216\li0\ri0\widctlpar\nooverflow\faroman\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs21\insrsid3755814 Zip\rquote s brow remained furrowed. He showed little em}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par Three hours went by. Joe\rquote s eyes were drooping, but Zip was still intent, his eyes on Mark.
\par Mark clapped his hands and turned to Madera. Madera smiled and raised his ey
ebrows. With an open hand, he gestured to the control panel. Mark nodded his thanks and pressed several buttons. The files changed rapidly at each new command. Then Mark made fists and clenched a few times as if massaging his fingers. Then he raised his h

\par Suddenly he leaped back a foot, his hands lifted as if he had touched a hot surface. His face was white, his eyes were wide open, and he was breathing hard. His body was trembling as if he wer

\par \'93What is it, Mark? What\rquote s wrong?\'94 His voice was u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 r}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 gent.

\par \'93You all heard,\'94 Zip said. \'93But you all know that we have no choice.\'94 No one said anything. A few men dropped their eyes and shuffled their feet. Zip turned to Mr. Madera in silent appeal. Madera nodded very slowly.
\par Then Mark wiped both hands on his shirt and slowly reached out and pressed the last button.
\par A distant grinding noise as of gears engaging sounded from far away. There was a whooshing sound as of air fil}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 l}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 ing a giant bag. The grinding sound leveled off into a bare hum. The lights gradually came on. 

\par The men cheered. Mark looked relieved. The tension under which he had been operating quickly released. His face wrinkled up and tears began to flow down his cheeks.
\par Then the bare hum began to build. It turned into a whine, and then into a shriek. The floor began to shudder. Mark wiped his eyes and stared at the screen.
\par \'93The reaction is starting, but the energy level is climbing much faster than it should! Something\rquote s wrong! }{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 Som}{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 e}{\i\fs21\insrsid3755814 thing\rquote s wrong!!\'94}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 
\par The men began to hear small explosions. There wa

\par All at once a panel a hundred yards 
away blew out in a monstrous explosion. A burst of brilliant white light blinded the men momentarily. As their eyes returned to normal a loud hiss cut through the air and continued to build. Yellow and orange sparks erupted in a spectacular shower from th

 damaged panel. Mark turned toward the site with a look of panic. Without warning a connector at the panel lit up with a coruscating orange color. Unable to handle the power surge, it began to melt and fragment. In less than a second, the damage shot thro
ugh the connector and came to where it entered the computer terminal. There was a sickening, deep \'93brrzzz\'94 sound, and the screen went dark.
\par Mark slumped toward the floor. Madera grabbed the Starman before he fell and eased him to the iron deck. Joe ran forward.

On the evening of September 9, the asteroid streaked through the night sky, drawing the awed attention of people all over the planet. It was best seen from the island of Van}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 u}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

a celebration to honor them for their critical role in freeing Mars from the clutches of the pirates. The celebration had been postponed when the greatest threat ever to menace the Earth was engineered by Lurton Zimbardo, and then turned aside.
\par The Starmen were the subjects of many award cerem}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 o}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 nies, dinners and receptions, interviews, and parades. With them were Richard Starlight, Robert Nolan, Jesus Madera-Cruz, and others who had been 
instrumental in freeing the Earth from destruction. The three Starmen were delighted to see Steve Cliff again, for he was honored along with them for the part he had played in the liberation of Mars. Jack and Jill were also invited, but preferred to remai

\par The highlight of the celebration was a ceremony on the grounds of the capital in New Washington, when the Pres}{\fs21\insrsid3755814 i}{\fs21\insrsid3755814

\par One afternoon, they were in Richard Starlight\rquote s office. Richard had not had an opportunity to hear the Starmen\rquote
