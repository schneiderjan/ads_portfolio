<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<h3>Pariah</h3>


<p>The air of the city's cheapest flophouse was thick with
the smells of harsh antiseptic and unwashed bodies. The
early Christmas snowstorm had driven in every bum
who could steal or beg the price of admission, and the
long rows of cots were filled with fully clothed figures.
Those who could afford the extra dime were huddled
under thin, grimy blankets.</p>

<p>The pariah who had been Dr. Daniel Feldman enjoyed
no such luxury. He tossed fitfully on a bare cot, bringing
his face into the dim light. It had been a handsome
face, but now the black stubble of beard lay over gaunt
features and sunken cheeks. He looked ten years older
than his scant thirty-two, and there <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'was'.">were</ins> the beginnings
of a snarl at the corners of his mouth. Clothes that had
once been expensive were wrinkled and covered with
grime that no amount of cleaning could remove. His
tall, thin body was awkwardly curled up in a vain effort
to conserve heat and one of his hands instinctively
clutched at his tiny bag of possessions.</p>

<p>He stirred again, and suddenly jerked upright with a
protest already forming on his lips. The ugly surroundings
registered on his eyes, and he stared suspiciously
at the other cots. But there was no sign that anyone had
been trying to rob him of his bindle or the precious
bag of cheap tobacco.</p>

<p>He started to relax back onto the couch when a sound
caught his attention, even over the snoring of the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
It was a low wail, the sound of a man who can no longer
control himself.</p>

<p>Feldman swung to the cot on his left as the moan
hacked off. The man there was well fed and clean-shaven,
but his face was gray with sickness. He was
writhing and clutching his stomach, arching his back
against the misery inside him.</p>

<p>"Space-stomach?" Feldman diagnosed.</p>

<p>He had no need of the weak answering nod. He'd
treated such cases several times in the past. The disease
was usually caused by the absence of gravity out in
space, but it could be brought on later from abuse of
the weakened internal organs, such as the intake of too
much bad liquor. The man must have been frequenting
the wrong space-front bars.</p>

<p>Now he was obviously dying. Violent peristaltic contractions
seemed to be tearing the intestines out of him,
and the paroxysms were coming faster. His eyes darted
to Feldman's tobacco sack and there was animal appeal
in them.</p>

<p>Feldman hesitated, then reluctantly rolled a smoke. He
held the cigarette while the spaceman took a long, gasping
drag on it. He smoked the remainder himself, letting
the harsh tobacco burn against his lungs and sicken
his empty stomach. Then he shrugged and threaded his
way through the narrow aisles toward the attendant.</p>

<p>"Better get a doctor," he said bitterly, when the young
punk looked up at him. "You've got a man dying of
space-stomach on 214."</p>

<p>The sneer on the kid's face deepened. "Yeah? We
don't pay for doctors every time some wino wants to
throw up. Forget it and get back where you belong,
bo."</p>

<p>"You'll have a corpse on your hands in an hour,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Feldman insisted. "I know space-stomach, damn it."</p>

<p>The kid turned back to his lottery sheet. "Go treat
yourself if you wanta play doctor. Go on, scram&mdash;before
I toss you out in the snow!"</p>

<p>One of Feldman's white-knuckled hands reached for
the attendant. Then he caught himself. He started to
turn back, hesitated, and finally faced the kid again.
"I'm not fooling. And I <i>was</i> a doctor," he stated. "My
name is Daniel Feldman."</p>

<p>The attendant nodded absently, until the words finally
penetrated. He looked up, studied Feldman with surprised
curiosity and growing contempt, and reached for
the phone. "Gimme Medical Directory," he muttered.</p>

<p>Feldman felt the kid's eyes on his back as he stumbled
through the aisles to his cot again. He slumped down,
rolling another cigarette in hands that shook. The sick
man was approaching delirium now, and the moans were
mixed with weak whining sounds of fear. Other men
had wakened and were watching, but nobody made a
move to help.</p>

<p>The retching and writhing of the sick man had begun
to weaken, but it was still not too late to save him.
Hot water and skillful massage could interrupt the paroxysms.
In fifteen minutes, Feldman could have stopped
the attack completely.</p>

<p>He found his feet on the floor and his hands already
reaching out. Savagely he pulled himself back. Sure, he
could save the man&mdash;and wind up in the gas chamber!
There'd be no mercy for his second offense against
Lobby laws. If the spaceman lived, Feldman might get
off with a flogging&mdash;that was standard punishment for
a pariah who stepped out of line. But with his luck,
there would be a heart arrest and another juicy story
for the papers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Idealism! The Medical Lobby made a lot out of the
word. But it wasn't for him. A pariah had no business
thinking of others.</p>

<p>As Feldman sat there staring, the spaceman grew
quieter. Sometimes, even at this stage, massage could
help. It was harder without liberal supplies of hot water,
but the massage was the really important treatment. It
was the trembling of Feldman's hands that stopped him.
He no longer had the strength or the certainty to make
the massage effective.</p>

<p>He was glaring at his hands in self-disgust when the
legal doctor arrived. The man was old and tired. Probably
he had been another idealist who had wound up
defeated, content to leave things up to the established
procedures of the Medical Lobby. He looked it as he
bent over the dying man.</p>

<p>The doctor turned back at last to the attendant. "Too
late. The best I can do is ease his pain. The call should
have been made half an hour earlier."</p>

<p>He had obviously never handled space-stomach before.
He administered a hypo that probably held narconal.
Feldman watched, his guts tightening sympathetically
for the shock that would be to the sick man. But
at least it would shorten his sufferings. The final seizure
lasted only a minute or so.</p>

<p>"Hopeless," the doctor said. His eyes were clouded
for a moment, and then he shrugged. "Well, I'll make
out a death certificate. Anyone here know his name?"</p>

<p>His eyes swung about the cots until they came to rest
on Feldman. He frowned, and a twisted smile curved
his lips.</p>

<p>"Feldman, isn't it? You still look something like your
pictures. Do you know the deceased?"</p>

<p>Feldman shook his head bitterly. "No. I don't know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
his name. I don't even know why he wasn't cyanotic at
the end, <i>if</i> it was space-stomach. Do you, doctor?"</p>

<p>The old man threw a startled glance at the corpse.
Then he shrugged and nodded to the attendant. "Well,
go through his things. If he still has a space ticket, I
can get his name from that."</p>

<p>The kid began pawing through the bag that had fallen
from the cot. He dragged out a pair of shoes, half a
bottle of cheap rum, a wallet and a bronze space ticket.
He wasn't quick enough with the wallet, and the doctor
took it from him.</p>

<p>"Medical Lobby authorization. If he has any money,
it covers my fee and the rest goes to his own Lobby."
There were several bills, all of large denominations. He
turned the ticket over and began filling in the death
certificate. "Arthur Billings. Space Lobby. Crewman.
Cause of death, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'ideopathic gastroentiritis'.">idiopathic gastroenteritis</ins> <i>and</i> delirium
tremens."</p>

<p>There had been no evidence of delirium tremens, but
apparently the doctor felt he had scored a point. He
tossed the space ticket toward the shoes, closed his bag,
and prepared to leave.</p>

<p>"Hey, doc!" The attendant's voice was indignant.
"Hey, what about my reporting fee?"</p>

<p>The doctor stopped. He glanced at the kid, then toward
Feldman, his face a mixture of speculation and
dislike. He took a dollar bill from the wallet. "That's
right," he admitted. "The fee for reporting a solvent
case. Medical Lobby rules apply&mdash;even to a man who
breaks them."</p>

<p>The kid's hand was out, but the doctor dropped the
dollar onto Feldman's cot. "There's your fee, pariah."
He left, forcing the protesting attendant to precede him.</p>

<p>Feldman reached for the bill. It was blood money for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
letting a man die&mdash;but it meant cigarettes and food&mdash;or
shelter for another night, if he could get a mission meal.
He no longer could afford pride. Grimly, he pocketed
the bill, staring at the face of the dead man. It looked
back sightlessly, now showing a faint speckling of tiny
dots. They caught Feldman's eyes, and he bent closer.
There should be no black dots on the skin of a man
who died of space-stomach. And there should have been
cyanosis....</p>

<p>He swore and bent down to find the wrecks of his
shoes. He couldn't worry about anything now but getting
away from here before the attendant made trouble.
His eyes rested on the shoes of the dead man&mdash;sturdy
boots that would last for another year. They could do
the corpse no good; someone else would steal them if he
didn't. But he hesitated, cursing himself.</p>

<p>The right boot fitted better than he could have expected,
but something got in the way as he tried to put
the left one on. His fingers found the bronze ticket. He
turned it over, considering it. He wasn't ready to fraud
his identity for what he'd heard of life on the spaceships,
yet. But he shoved it into his pocket and finished
lacing the boots.</p>

<p>Outside, the snow was still falling, but it had turned
to slush, and the sidewalk was soggy underfoot. There
was going to be no work shoveling snow, he realized.
This would melt before the day was over. Feldman
hunched the suitcoat up, shivering as the cold bit into
him. The boots felt good, though; if he'd had socks,
they would have been completely comfortable.</p>

<p>He passed a cheap restaurant, and the smell of the
synthetics set his stomach churning. It had been two
days since his last real meal, and the dollar burned in
his pocket. But he had to wait. There was a fair chance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
this early that he could scavenge something edible.</p>

<p>He shuffled on. After a while, the cold bothered him
less, and he passed through the hunger spell. He rolled
another smoke and sucked at it, hardly thinking. It was
better that way.</p>

<p>It was much later when the big caduceus set into the
sidewalk snapped him back to awareness of where he'd
traveled. His undirected feet had led him much too far
uptown, following old habits. This was the Medical
Lobby building, where he'd spent more than enough
time, including three weeks in custody before they
stripped him of all rank and status.</p>

<p>His eyes wandered to the ornate entrance where he'd
first emerged as a pariah. He'd meant to walk down
those steps as if he were still a man. But each step had
drained his resolution, until he'd finally covered his face
and slunk off, knowing himself for what the world had
branded him.</p>

<p>He stood there now, staring at the smug young medical
politicians and the tired old general practitioners
filing in and out. One of the latter halted, fumbled in
his pocket and drew out a quarter.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas!" he said dully.</p>

<p>Feldman fingered the coin. Then he saw a gray Medical
policeman watching him, and he knew it was time
to move on. Sooner or later, someone would recognize
him here.</p>

<p>He clutched the quarter and turned to look for a coffee
shop that sold the synthetics to which his metabolism
had been switched. No shop would serve him here,
but he could buy coffee and a piece of cake to take out.</p>

<p>A flurry of motion registered from the corner of his
eye, and he glanced back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Taxi! Taxi!"</p>

<p>The girl rushing down the steps had a clear soprano
voice, cultured and commanding. The gray Medical uniform
seemed molded to her shapely figure and her red
hair glistened in the lights of the street. Her snub nose
and determined mouth weren't the current fashion, but
nobody stopped to think of fashions when they saw her.
She didn't have to be the daughter of the president of
Medical Lobby to rule.</p>

<p>It was Chris&mdash;Chris Feldman once, and now Chris
Ryan again.</p>

<p>Feldman swung toward a cab. For a moment, his attitude
was automatic and assured, and the cab stopped
before the driver noticed his clothes. He picked up the
bag Chris dropped and swung it onto the front seat.
She was fumbling in her change purse as he turned back
to shut the door.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my good man," she said. She could be
gracious, even to a pariah, when his homage suited her.
She dropped two quarters into his hand, raising her eyes.</p>

<p>Recognition flowed into them, followed by icy shock.
She yanked the cab door shut and shouted something to
the driver. The cab took off with a rush that left Feldman
in a backwash of slush and mud.</p>

<p>He glanced down at the coins in his hand. It was his
lucky day, he thought bitterly.</p>

<p>He moved across the street and away, not bothering
about the squeal of brakes and the honking horns. He
looked back only once, toward the glowing sign that
topped the building. <i>Your health is our business!</i> Then
the great symbol of the health business faded behind
him, and he stumbled on, sucking incessantly at the
cigarettes he rolled. One hand clutched the bronze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
badge belonging to the dead man and his stolen boots
drove onward through the melting snow.</p>

<p>It was Christmas in the year 2100 on the protectorate
of Earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<h3>Lobby</h3>


<p>Feldman had set his legs the problem of heading for
the great spaceport and escape from Earth, and he let
them take him without further guidance. His mind was
wrapped up in a whirl of the past&mdash;his past and that of
the whole planet. Both pasts had in common the growth
and sudden ruin of idealism.</p>

<p>Idealism! Throughout history, some men had sought
the ideal, and most had called it freedom. Only fools expected
absolute freedom, but wise men dreamed up
many systems of relative freedom, including democracy.
They had tried that in America, as the last fling
of the dream. It had been a good attempt, too.</p>

<p>The men who drew the Constitution had been pretty
practical dreamers. They came to their task after a bitter
war and a worse period of wild chaos, and they had
learned where idealism stopped and idiocy began. They
set up a republic with all the elements of democracy
that they considered safe. It had worked well enough
to make America the number one power of the world.
But the men who followed the framers of the new plan
were a different sort, without the knowledge of practical
limits.</p>

<p>The privileges their ancestors had earned in blood
and care became automatic rights. Practical men tried
to explain that there were no such rights&mdash;that each generation
had to pay for its rights with responsibility. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
kind of talk didn't get far. People wanted to hear about
rights, not about duties.</p>

<p>They took the phrase that all men were created equal
and left out the implied kicker that equality was in the
sight of God and before the law. They wanted an equality
with the greatest men without giving up their drive
toward mediocrity, and they meant to have it. In a way,
they got it.</p>

<p>They got the vote extended to everyone. The man
on subsidy or public dole could vote to demand more.
The man who read of nothing beyond sex crimes could
vote on the great political issues of the world. No ability
was needed for his vote. In fact, he was assured
that voting alone was enough to make him a fine and
noble citizen. He loved that, if he bothered to vote at
all that year. He became a great man by listing his unthought,
hungry desire for someone to take care of him
without responsibility. So he went out and voted for
the man who promised him most, or who looked most
like what his limited dreams felt to be a father image or
son image or hero image. He never bothered later to
see how the men he'd elected had handled the jobs he
had given them.</p>

<p>Someone had to look, of course, and someone did. Organized
special interests stepped in where the mob had
failed. Lobbies grew up. There had always been pressure
groups, but now they developed into a third arm
of the government.</p>

<p>The old Farm Lobby was unbeatable. The big farmers
shaped the laws they wanted. They convinced the
little farmers it was for the good of all, and they made
the story stick well enough to swing the farm vote.
They made the laws when it came to food and crops.</p>

<p>The last of the great lobbies was Space, probably. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
was an accident that grew up so fast it never even knew
it wasn't a real part of the government. It developed
during a period of chaos when another country called
Russia got the first hunk of metal above the atmosphere
and when the representatives who had been picked for
everything but their grasp of science and government
went into panic over a myth of national prestige.</p>

<p>The space effort was turned over to the aircraft industry,
which had never been able to manage itself successfully
except under the stimulus of war or a threat
of war. The failing airplane industry became the space
combine overnight, and nobody kept track of how big
it was, except a few sharp operators.</p>

<p>They worked out a system of subcontracts that spread
the profits so wide that hardly a company of any size in
the country wasn't getting a share. Thus a lot of patriotic,
noble voters got their pay from companies in the
lobby block and could be panicked by the lobby at the
first mention of recession.</p>

<p>So Space Lobby took over completely in its own field.
It developed enough pressure to get whatever appropriations
it wanted, even over Presidential veto. It created
the only space experts, which meant that the men placed
in government agencies to regulate it came from its own
ranks.</p>

<p>The other lobbies learned a lot from Space.</p>

<p>There had been a medical lobby long before, but it
had been a conservative group, mostly concerned with
protecting medical autonomy and ethics. It also tried to
prevent government control of treatment and payment,
feeling that it couldn't trust the people to know where
to stop. But its history was a long series of retreats.</p>

<p>It fought what it called socialized medicine. But the
people wanted their troubles handled free&mdash;which meant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
by government spending, since that could be added to
the national debt, and thus didn't seem to cost anything.
It lost, and eventually the government paid most medical
costs, with doctors working on a fixed fee. Then
quantity of treatment paid, rather than quality. Competence
no longer mattered so much. The Lobby lost,
but didn't know it&mdash;because the lowered standards of
competence in the profession lowered the caliber of
men running the political aspects of that profession as
exemplified by the Lobby.</p>

<p>It took a world-wide plague to turn the tide. The
plague began in old China; anything could start there,
with more than a billion people huddled in one area
and a few madmen planning to conquer the world. It
might have been a laboratory mutation, but nobody
could ever prove it.</p>

<p>It wiped out two billion people, depopulated Africa
and most of Asia, and wrecked Europe, leaving only
America comparatively safe to take over. An obscure
scientist in one of the laboratories run by the Medical
Lobby found a cure before the first waves of the epidemic
hit America. Rutherford Ryan, then head of the
Lobby, made sure that Medical Lobby got all the credit.</p>

<p>By the time the world recovered, America ran it and
the Medical Lobby was untouchable. Ryan made a deal
with Space Lobby, and the two effectively ran the
world. None of the smaller lobbies could buck them,
and neither could the government.</p>

<p>There was still a president and a congress, as there
had been a Senate under the Roman Caesars. But the
two Lobbies ran themselves as they chose. The real
government had become a kind of oligarchy, as it always
did after too much false democracy ruined the
ideals of real and practical self-rule. A man belonged to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his Lobby, just as a serf had belonged to his feudal landlord.</p>

<p>It was a safe world now. Maybe progress had been
halted at about the level of 1980, but so long as the citizens
didn't break the rules of their lobbies, they had
very little to worry about. For that, for security and the
right not to think, most people were willing to leave
well enough alone.</p>

<p>Some rules seemed harsh, of course, such as the law
that all operations had to be performed in Lobby hospitals.
But that could be justified; it was the only safe
kind of surgery and the only way to make sure there
was no unsupervised experimentation, such as that which
supposedly caused the plague. The rule was now an absolute
ethic of medicine. It also made for better fees.</p>

<p>Feldman's father had stuck by the rule but had questioned
it. Feldman learned not to question in medical
school. He scored second in Medical Ethics only to
Christina Ryan.</p>

<p>He had never figured why she singled him out for her
attentions, but he gloried in both those attentions and
the results. He became automatically a rising young
man, the favorite of the daughter of the Lobby president.
He went through internship without a sign of
trouble. Chris humored him in his desire to spend three
years of practice in a poor section loaded with disease,
and her father approved; such selfless dedication was
the perfect image projection for a future son-in-law. In
return, he agreed to follow that period by becoming
an administrator. A doctor's doctor, as they put it.</p>

<p>They were married in April and his office was ready
in May, complete with a staff of eighty. The publicity
releases had gone out, and the Public Relations Lobby
that handled news and education was paid to begin the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
greatest build-up any young genius ever had.</p>

<p>They celebrated that, with a little party of some four
hundred people and reporters at Ryan's lodge in Canada.
It was to be a gala weekend.</p>

<p>It was then that Baxter shot himself.</p>

<p>Baxter had been Feldman's closest friend in the Lobby.
He'd come along to handle press relations and had gotten
romantic about the countryside, never having been
out of a city before. He hired a guide and went hunting,
eighty miles beyond the last outpost of civilization.
Somehow, he got his hand on a gun, though only guides
were supposed to touch them, managed to overcome its
safety devices, and then pulled the trigger with the gun
pointed the wrong way.</p>

<p>Chris, Feldman and Harnett from Public Relations
had accompanied him on the trip. They were sitting in
a nearby car while Feldman enjoyed the scenery, Chris
made further plans, and Harnett gathered material.
There was also a photographer and writer, but they
hadn't been introduced by name.</p>

<p>Feldman reached Baxter first. The man was moaning
and scared, and he was bleeding profusely. Only a miracle
had saved him from instant death. The bullet had
struck a rib, been deflected and robbed of some of its
energy, and had barely reached the heart. But it had
pierced the pericardium, as best Feldman could guess,
and it could be fatal at any moment.</p>

<p>He'd reached for a probe without thinking. Chris
knocked his hand aside.</p>

<p>She was right, of course. He couldn't operate outside
a hospital. But they had no phone in the lodge where
the guide lived and no way to summon an ambulance.
They'd have to drive Baxter back in the car, which
would almost certainly result in his death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>When Feldman seemed uncertain, Harnett had given
his warning in a low but vehement voice. "You touch
him, Dan, and I'll spread it in every one of our media.
I'll have to. It's the only way to retain public confidence.
There'd be a leak, with all the guides and others here,
and we can't afford that. I like you&mdash;you have color. But
touch that wound and I'll crucify you."</p>

<p>Chris added her own threats. She'd spent years making
him the outlet for all her ambitions, denied because
women were still only second-rate members of Medical
Lobby. She couldn't let it go now. And she was
probably genuinely shocked.</p>

<p>Baxter groaned again and started to bleed more profusely.</p>

<p>There wasn't much equipment. Feldman operated with
a pocketknife sterilized in a bottle of expensive Scotch
and only anodyne tablets in place of anesthesia. He got
the bullet out and sewed up the wound with a bit of
surgical thread he'd been using to tie up a torn good-luck
emblem. The photographer and writer recorded
the whole thing. Chris swore harshly and beat her fists
against the bole of a tree. But Baxter lived. He recovered
completely, and was shocked at the heinous thing
that had been done to him.</p>

<p>They crucified Feldman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h3>Spaceman</h3>


<p>Most crewmen lived rough, ugly lives&mdash;and usually,
short ones. Passengers and officers on the big tubs were
given the equivalent of gravity in spinning compartments,
but the crews rode "free". The lucky crewmen
lived through their accidents, got space-stomach now
and then, and recovered. Nobody cared about the
others.</p>

<p>Feldman's ticket was work-stamped for the <i>Navaho</i>,
and nobody questioned his identity. He suffered through
the agony of acceleration on the shuttle up to the orbital
station, then was sick as acceleration stopped. But
he was able to control himself enough to follow other
crewmen down a hall of the station toward the <i>Navaho</i>.
The big ships never touched a planet, always docking
at the stations.</p>

<p>A checker met the crew and reached for their badges.
He barely glanced at them, punched a mark for each
on his checkoff sheet, and handed them back. "Deckmen
forward, tubemen to the rear," he ordered. "<i>Navaho</i>
blasts in fifteen minutes. Hey, you! You're tubes."</p>

<p>Feldman grunted. He should have expected it. Tubemen
had the lowest lot of all the crew. Between the
killing work, the heat of the tubes, and occasional doses
of radiation, their lives weren't worth the metal value
of their tickets.</p>

<p>He began pulling himself clumsily along a shaft, dodg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>ing
freight the loaders were tossing from hand to hand.
A bag hit his head, drawing blood, and another caught
him in the groin.</p>

<p>"Watch it, bo," a loader yelled at him. "You dent that
bag and they'll brig you. Cantcha see it's got a special
courtesy stripe?"</p>

<p>It had a brilliant green stripe, he saw. It also had a
name, printed in block letters that shouted their identity
before he could read the words. <i>Dr. Christina Ryan,
Southport, Mars.</i></p>

<p>And he'd had to choose this time to leave Earth!</p>

<p>Suddenly he was glad he was assigned to the tubes. It
was the one place on the ship where he'd be least likely
to run into her. As a doctor and a courtesy passenger,
she'd have complete run of the ship, but she'd hardly
bother with the dangerous and unpleasant tube section.</p>

<p>He dragged his way back, beginning to sweat with
the effort. The <i>Navaho</i> was an old ship. A lot of the
handholds were missing, and he had to throw himself
along by erratic leaps. He was gaining proficiency, but
not enough to handle himself if the ship blasted off.
Time was growing short when he reached the aft bunkroom
where the other tubemen were waiting.</p>

<p>"Ben," one husky introduced himself. "Tube chief.
Know how to work this?"</p>

<p>Feldman could see that they were assembling a small
still. He'd heard of the phenomenal quantities of beer
spacemen drank, and now he realized what really happened
to it. Hard liquor was supposed to be forbidden,
but they made their own. "I can work it," he decided.
"I'm&mdash;uh&mdash;Dan."</p>

<p>"Okay, Dan." Ben glanced at the clock. "Hit the
sacks, boys."</p>

<p>By the time Feldman could settle into the sacklike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
hammock, the <i>Navaho</i> began to shake faintly, and
weight piled up. It was mild compared to that on the
shuttle, since the big ships couldn't take high acceleration.
Space had been conquered for more than a century,
but the ships were still flimsy tubs that took months to
reach Mars, using immense amounts of fuel. Only the
valuable plant hormones from Mars made commerce
possible at the ridiculously high freight rate.</p>

<p>Three hours later he began to find out why spacemen
didn't seem to fear dying or turning pariah. The tube
quarters had grown insufferably hot during the long
blast, but the main tube-room was blistering as Ben led
the men into it. The chief handed out spacesuits and
motioned for Dan.</p>

<p>"Greenhorn, aincha? Okay, I'll take you with me. We
go out in the tubes and pull the lining. I pry up the
stuff, you carry it back here and stack it."</p>

<p>They sealed off the tube-room, pumped out the air,
and went into the steaming, mildly radioactive tubes,
just big enough for a man on hands and knees. Beyond
the tube mouth was empty space, waiting for the man
who slipped. Ben began ripping out the eroded blocks
with a special tool. Feldman carried them back and
stacked them along with others. A plasma furnace
melted them down into new blocks. The work grew
progressively worse as the distance to the tube-room
increased. The tube mouth yawned closer and closer.
There were no handholds there&mdash;only the friction of a
man's body in the tube.</p>

<p>Life settled into a dull routine of labor, sleep, and the
brief relief of the crude white mule from the still.</p>

<p>They were six weeks out and almost finished with
the tube cleaning when Number Two tube blew. Bits
of the remaining radioactive fuel must have collected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
slowly until they reached blow-point. Feldman in Number
One would have gone sailing out into space, but
Ben reacted at once. As the ship leaped slightly, Feldman
brought up sharply against the chief's braced body.
For a second their fate hung in the balance. Then it was
over, and Ben shoved him back, grinning faintly.</p>

<p>He jerked his thumb and touched helmets briefly.
"There they go, Dan."</p>

<p>The two men who had been working in Number
Two were charred lumps, drifting out into space.</p>

<p>No further comment was made on it, except that
they'd have to work harder from now on, since they
were shorthanded.</p>

<p>That rest period Feldman came down with a mild
attack of space-stomach&mdash;which meant no more drinking
for him&mdash;and was off work for a day. Then the
pace picked up. The tubes were cleared and they began
laying the new lining for the landing blasts. There
was no time for thought after that. Mars' orbital station
lay close when the work was finished.</p>

<p>Ben slapped Feldman on the back. "Ya ain't bad for
a greenie, Dan. We all get six-day passes on Mars. Hit
the sack now so you won't waste time sleeping then.
We'll hear it when the ship berths."</p>

<p>Feldman didn't hear it, but the others did. He felt
Ben shaking his shoulder, trying to drag him out of
the sack. "Grab your junk, Dan."</p>

<p>Ben picked up Feldman's nearly empty bag and
tossed it toward him, before his eyes were fully open.
He grabbed for it and missed. He grabbed again, with
Ben's laughter in his ears. The bag hit the wall and
fell open, spilling its contents.</p>

<p>Feldman began gathering it up, but the chief was no
longer laughing. A big hand grabbed up the space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
ticket suddenly, and there was no friendliness now on
Ben's face.</p>

<p>"Art Billing's card!" Ben told the other tubemen.
"Five trips I made with Art. He was saving his money,
going to buy a farm on Mars. Five trips and one more
to go before he had enough. Now you show up with
his ticket!"</p>

<p>The tubemen moved forward toward Feldman. There
was no indecision. To them, apparently, trial had been
held and sentence passed.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Feldman began. "Billings died of&mdash;"</p>

<p>A fist snaked past his raised hand and connected with
his jaw. He bounced off a wall. A wrench sailed toward
him, glanced off his arm, and ripped at his muscles. Another
heavy fist struck.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Ben's voice cut through their yells. "Hold
it!" He shoved through the group, tossing men backwards.
"Stow it! We can take care of him later. Right
now, this is captain's business. You fools want to lose
your leave?" He indicated two of the others. "You two
bring him along&mdash;and keep him quiet!"</p>

<p>The two grabbed Feldman's arms and dragged him
along as the chief began pulling his way forward
through the tubes up towards the control section of the
ship. Feldman took a quick glance at their faces and
made no effort to resist; they obviously would have enjoyed
any chance to subdue him.</p>

<p>They were stopped twice by minor officers, then sent
on. They finally found the captain near the exit lock,
apparently assisting the passengers to leave. Most of
them went on into the shuttle, but Chris Ryan remained
behind as the captain listened to Ben's report
and inspected the false ticket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally the captain turned to Feldman. "You. What's
your name?"</p>

<p>Chris' eyes were squarely on Feldman, cold and furious.
"He <i>was</i> Doctor Daniel Feldman, Captain Marker,"
she stated.</p>

<p>Feldman stood paralyzed. He'd been unwilling to face
Chris. He wanted to avoid all the past. But the idea
that she would denounce him had never entered his
head. There was no Medical rule involved. She knew
that as a pariah he was forbidden to board a passenger
ship, of course. But she'd been his wife once!</p>

<p>Marker bowed slightly to her. "Thank you, Dr. Ryan.
I should take this criminal back to Earth in chains, I
suppose. But he's hardly worth the freightage. You men.
Want to take him down to Mars and ground him there?"</p>

<p>Ben grinned and touched his forelock. "Thank you,
sir. We'd enjoy that."</p>

<p>"Good. His pay reverts to the ship's fund. That's all,
men."</p>

<p>Feldman started to protest, but a fist lashed savagely
against his mouth.</p>

<p>He made no other protests as they dragged him into
the crew shuttle that took off for Southport. He avoided
their eyes and sat hunched over. It was Ben who finally
broke the silence.</p>

<p>"What happened to Art's money? He had a pile on
him."</p>

<p>"Go to hell!"</p>

<p>"Give, I said!" Ben twisted his arm back toward his
shoulder, applying increasing pressure.</p>

<p>"A doctor took it for his fee when Billings died of
space-stomach. Damn you, I couldn't help him!"</p>

<p>Ben looked at the others. "Med Lobby fee, eh? All
the market will take. Umm. It could be, maybe." He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
shrugged. "Okay, reasonable doubt. We won't kill you,
bo. Not quite, we won't."</p>

<p>The shuttle landed and Ben handed out the little helmets
and aspirators that made life possible in Mars'
thin air. Outside, the tubemen took turns holding Feldman
and beating him while the passengers disembarked
from their shuttle. As he slumped into unconsciousness,
he had a picture of Chris Ryan's frozen face as she
moved steadily toward the port station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<h3>Martian</h3>


<p>It was night when Feldman came to, and the temperature
was dropping rapidly. He struggled to sit up
through a fog of pain. Somewhere in his bag, he should
have an anodyne tablet that would kill any ache. He
finally found the pill and swallowed it, fumbling with
the aspirator lip opening.</p>

<p>The aspirator meant life to him now, he suddenly realized.
He twisted to stare at the tiny charge-indicator
for the battery. It showed half-charge. Then he saw that
someone had attached another battery beside it. He puzzled
briefly over it, but his immediate concern was for
shelter.</p>

<p>Apparently he was still where he had been knocked
out. There was a light coming from the little station,
and he headed toward that, fumbling for the few quarters
that represented his entire fortune.</p>

<p>Maybe it would have been better if the tubemen had
killed him. Batteries were an absolute necessity here,
food and shelter would be expensive, and he had no
skills to earn his way. At most, he had only a day or so
left. But meantime, he had to find warmth before the
cold killed him.</p>

<p>The tiny restaurant in the station was still open, and
the air was warm inside. He pulled off the aspirator,
shutting off the battery.</p>

<p>The counterman didn't even glance up as he entered.
Feldman gazed at the printed menu and flinched.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Soup," he ordered. It was the cheapest item he could
find.</p>

<p>The counterman stared at him, obviously spotting his
Earth origin. "You adjusted to synthetics?"</p>

<p>Feldman nodded. Earth operated on a mixed diet,
with synthetics for all who couldn't afford the natural
foods there. But Mars was all synthetic. Many of the
chemicals in food could exist in either of two forms, or
isomers; they were chemically alike, but differently crystallized.
Sometimes either form was digestible, but frequently
the body could use only the isomer to which it
was adjusted.</p>

<p>Martian plants produced different isomers from those
on Earth. Since the synthetic foods turned out to be
Mars-normal, that was probably the more natural form.
Research designed to let the early colonists live off native
food here had turned up an enzyme that enabled
the body to handle either isomer. In a few weeks of eating
Martian or synthetic food, the body adapted; without
more enzyme, it lost its power to handle Earth-normal
food.</p>

<p>The cheapness of <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'snythetics'.">synthetics</ins> and the discovery that
many diseases common to Earth would not attack Mars-normal
bodies led to the wide use of synthetics on
Earth. No pariah could have been expected to afford
Earth-normal.</p>

<p>Feldman finished the soup, and found a cigarette
that was smokable. "Any objections if I sit in the waiting
room?"</p>

<p>He'd expected a rejection, but the counterman only
shrugged. The waiting room was almost dark and the
air was chilly, but there was normal pressure. He found
a bench and slumped onto it, lighting his cigarette.
He'd miss the smokes&mdash;but probably not for long. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
finished the cigarette reluctantly and sat huddled on the
bench, waiting for morning.</p>

<p>The airlock opened later, and feet sounded on the
boards of the waiting-room floor, but he didn't look up
until a thin beam of light hit him. Then he sighed and
nodded. The shoes, made of some odd fiber, didn't look
like those of a cop, but this was Mars. He could see
only a hulking shadow behind the light.</p>

<p>"You the man who was a medical doctor?" The voice
was dry and old.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Feldman answered. "Once."</p>

<p>"Good. Thought that space crewman was just lying
drunk at first. Come along, Doc."</p>

<p>"Why?" It didn't matter, but if they wanted him to
move on, they'd have to push a little harder.</p>

<p>The light swung up to show the other. He was the
shade of old leather with a bleached patch of sandy hair
and the deepest gray eyes Feldman had ever seen. It
was a face that could have belonged to a country storekeeper
in New England, with the same hint of dry humor.
The man was dressed in padded levis and a leather
jacket of unguessable age. His aspirator seemed worn
and patched, and one big hand fumbled with it.</p>

<p>"Because we're friends, Doc," the voice drawled at
him. "Because you might as well come with us as sit
here. Maybe we have a job for you."</p>

<p>Feldman shrugged and stood up. If the man was a
Lobby policeman, he was different from the usual kind.
Nothing could be worse than the present prospects.</p>

<p>They went out through the doors of the waiting room
toward a rattletrap vehicle. It looked something like a
cross between a schoolboy's jalopy and a scaled-down
army tank of former times. The treads were caterpillar
style, and the stubby body was completely enclosed. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
tiny airlock stuck out from the rear.</p>

<p>Two men were inside, both bearded. The old man
grinned at them. "Mark, Lou, meet Doc Feldman. Sit,
Doc. I'm Jake Mullens, and you might say we were
farmers."</p>

<p>The motor started with a wheeze. The tractor swung
about and began heading away from Southport toward
the desert dunes. It shook and rattled, but it seemed to
make good time.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about farming," Feldman protested.</p>

<p>Jake shrugged. "No, of course not. Couple of our
friends heard about you where a spaceman was getting
drunk and tipped us off. We know who you are. Here,
try a bracky?"</p>

<p>Feldman took what seemed to be a cigarette and
studied it doubtfully. It was coarse and fibrous inside,
with a thin, hard shell that seemed to be a natural
growth, as if it had been chopped from some vine. He
lighted it, not knowing what to expect. Then he
coughed as the bitter, rancid smoke burned at his throat.
He started to throw it down, and hesitated. Jake was
smoking one, and it had killed the craving for tobacco
almost instantly.</p>

<p>"Some like 'em, most don't," Jake said. "They won't
hurt you. Look&mdash;see that? Old Martian ruins. Built by
some race a million years ago. Only half a dozen on
Mars."</p>

<p>It was only a clump of weathered stone buildings in
the light from the tractor, and Feldman had seen better
in the stereo shots. It was interesting only because it
connected with the legendary Martian race, like the canals
that showed from space but could not be seen on
the surface of the planet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Feldman waited for the other to go on, but Jake was
silent. Finally, he ground out the butt of the weed.
"Okay, Jake. What do you want with me?"</p>

<p>"Consultation, maybe. Ever hear of herb doctors? I'm
one of them."</p>

<p>Feldman knew that the Lobby permitted some leniency
here, due to the scarcity of real medical help.
There was only one decent hospital at Northport, on
the opposite side of the planet.</p>

<p>Jake sighed and reached for another bracky weed.
"Yeah, I'm pretty good with herbs. But I got a sick
village on my hands and I can't handle it. We can't all
mortgage our work to pay for a trip to Northport.
Southport's all messed up while the new she-doctor gets
her metabolism changed. Maybe the old guy there
would have helped, but he died a couple months ago.
So it looks like you're our only hope."</p>

<p>"Then you have no hope," Feldman told him sickly.
"I'm a pariah, Jake. I can't do a thing for you."</p>

<p>"We heard about your argument with the Lobby.
News reaches Mars. But these are mighty sick people,
Doc."</p>

<p>Feldman shook his head. "Better take me back. I'm
not allowed to practice medicine. The charge would be
first-degree murder if anything happened."</p>

<p>Lou leaned forward. "Shall I talk to him, Jake?"</p>

<p>The old man grimaced. "Time enough. Let him see
what we got first."</p>

<p>Sand howled against the windshield and the tractor
bumped and surged along. Feldman took another of the
weeds and tried to estimate their course. But he had no
idea where they were when the tractor finally stopped.
There was a village of small huts that seemed to be
merely entrances to living quarters dug under the sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>face.
They led him into one and through a tunnel into
a large room filled with simple cots and the unhappy
sounds of sick people.</p>

<p>Two women were disconsolately trying to attend to
the half-dozen sick&mdash;four children and two adults. Their
faces brightened as they saw Jake, then fell. "Eb and
Tilda died," they reported.</p>

<p>Feldman looked at the two figures under the sheets
and whistled. The same black specks he had seen on the
face of Billings covered the skins of the two old people
who had died.</p>

<p>"Funny," Jake said slowly. "They didn't quite act like
the others and they sure died mighty fast. Darn it, I
had it figured for that stuff in the book. Infantile paralysis.
How about it, Doc? Sort of like a cold, stiff
sore neck."</p>

<p>It was clearly polio&mdash;one of the diseases that could attack
Mars-normal flesh. Feldman nodded at the symptoms,
staring at the sick kids. He shrugged, finally.
"There's a cure for it, but I don't have the serum. Neither
do you, or you wouldn't have brought me here. I
couldn't help if I wanted to."</p>

<p>"That old book didn't list a cure," Jake told him.
"But it said the kids didn't have to be crippled. There
was something about a Kenny treatment. Doc, does the
stuff really cripple for life?"</p>

<p>Feldman saw one of the boys flinch. He dropped his
eyes, remembering the Lobby's efficient spy service on
Earth and wondering what it was like here. But he knew
the outcome.</p>

<p>"Damn you, Jake!"</p>

<p>Jake chuckled. "Thought you would. We sure appreciate
it. Just tell us what to do, Doc."</p>

<p>Feldman began writing down his requirements, try<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ing
to remember the details of the treatment. Exercise,
hot compresses, massage. It was coming back to him.
He'd have to do it himself, of course, to get the feel
of it. He couldn't explain it well enough. But he couldn't
turn his back on the kids, either.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can help," he said doubtfully as he moved
toward a cot.</p>

<p>"No, Doc." Jake's voice wasn't amused any longer,
and he held the younger man back. "You're doing us a
favor, and I'll be darned if I'll let you stick your neck
out too far. You can't treat 'em yourself. Mars is
tougher than Earth. You should live under Space Lobby
<i>and</i> Medical Lobby here a while. Oh, maybe they
don't mind a few fools like me being herb doctors, but
they'd sure hate to have a man who can do real medicine
outside their hands. You let me do it, or get in
the tractor and I'll have Lou drive you back. Once you
start in here, there'll be no stopping. Believe me."</p>

<p>Feldman looked at him, seeing the colonials around
him for the first time as people. It had been a long time
since he'd been treated as a fellow human by anyone.</p>

<p>Jake was right, he knew. Once he put his hand to the
bandage, eventually there'd be no turning back from
the scalpel. These people needed medical help too desperately.
Eventually, the news would spread, and the
Lobby police would come for him. Chris couldn't afford
to shield him. In fact, he was sure now that she'd
hunt him night and day.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Jake," he ordered brusquely. He
handed his list to one of the women. "You'll have to
learn to do what I do," he told the people there. "You'll
have to work like fools for weeks. But there won't be
many crippled children. I can promise that much!"</p>

<p>He blinked sharply at the sudden hope in their eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
But his mind went on wondering how long it would
be before the inevitable would catch up with him. With
luck, maybe a few months. But he hadn't been blessed
with any superabundance of luck. It would probably be
less time than he thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<h3>Surgery</h3>


<p>Doc Feldman's luck was better than he had expected.
For an Earth year, he was a doctor again, moving about
from village to village as he was needed and doing what
he could.</p>

<p>The village had been isolated during the early colonization
when Mars made a feeble attempt to break free
of Space Lobby. Their supplies had been cut off and
they had been forced to do for themselves. Now they
were largely self-sufficient. They grew native plants and
extracted hormones in crude little chemical plants. The
hormones were traded to the big chemical plants for a
pittance to buy what had to come from Earth. Other
jury-rigged affairs synthesized much of their food. But
mostly they learned to get along on what Mars provided.</p>

<p>Doc Feldman learned from them. Money was no
longer part of his life. He ate with whatever family
needed him and slipped into the life around him.</p>

<p>He was learning Martian medicine and finding that
his Earth courses were mostly useless. No wonder the
villagers distrusted Lobby doctors. Doc had his own little
laboratory where he had managed to start making
Mars-normal penicillin&mdash;a primitive antibiotic, but better
than nothing.</p>

<p>Jake had come to remind him that it was his first anniversary,
and now they were smoking bracky together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sheer luck, Jake," Doc repeated. "You Martians are
tough. But some day someone is going to die under my
care, with the little equipment I have. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jake nodded slowly. "Maybe, Doc. And maybe some
day Mars will break free of the Lobbies. You'd better
pray for that."</p>

<p>"I've been&mdash;" Doc stopped, realizing what he'd
started to say. The old man chuckled.</p>

<p>"You've been talking rebellion for months, Doc. I
hear rumors. Whenever you get mad, you want us to
secede. But you don't really mean it yet. You can't picture
any government but the one you're used to."</p>

<p>Doc grinned. Jake had a point, but it was not as
strong as it would have been a few months before. The
towns under the Lobby were cheap imitations of Earth,
but here, divorced to a large extent from the lobbies,
the villages were making Mars their own. Their ways
might be strange; but they worked.</p>

<p>Jake shifted his body in the weak sunlight. "Newton
village forgot to report a death on time. I hear Ryan
is sweating them out, trying to prove it was your fault."</p>

<p>There was no evidence against him yet, Doc was sure.
But Chris was out to prove something, and to get a
reputation as a top-flight administrator. It must have
hurt when they shipped her here as head of the lesser
hemisphere of Mars. She'd expected to use Feldman as
a front while she became the actual ruler of the whole
Lobby. Now she wanted to strike back.</p>

<p>"She's using blackmail," he said, and some of his old
bitterness was in his voice. "Anyone taking treatment
from an herb doctor in this section is cut off from Medical
Lobby service. Damn it, Jake, that could mean letting
people die!"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Jake sighed softly. "It could mean letting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
people begin to think about getting rid of the Lobby,
too. Well, I gotta help harvest the bracky. Take it easy
on operating for a while, will you, Doc?"</p>

<p>"All right, Jake. But stop keeping the serious cases a
secret. Two men died last month because you wouldn't
call me for surgery. I've broken all my oaths already.
It doesn't matter anymore."</p>

<p>"It matters, boy. We've been lucky, but some day one
case will go to the hospital and they'll find your former
work. Then they'll really be after you. The less you do
the better."</p>

<p>Doc watched Jake slump off, then turned down into
the little root cellar and back toward the room concealed
behind it, where his crude laboratory lay. For
the moment, he was free to work on the mystery of the
black spots.</p>

<p>He kept running into them&mdash;always on the body of
someone who died of something that seemed like a normal
disease. Without a microscope, he was almost helpless,
but he had taken specimens and tried to culture
them. Some of his cultures had grown, though they
might be nothing but unknown Martian fungi or bacteria.
Mars was dry and almost devoid of air, but plants
and a few smaller insects had survived and adapted. It
wasn't by any means lifeless.</p>

<p>Without a microscope, he could do little but depend
on his files of cases. But today there was new evidence.
A villager had filched an Earth <i>Medical Journal</i> from
the tractor driven by Chris Ryan and forwarded it to
him. He found the black specks mentioned in a single
paragraph, under skin diseases. Investigation of the diet
was being made, since all cases were among people
eating synthetics.</p>

<p>There was another article on aberrant cases&mdash;a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
strange little misbehaviors in classical syndromes. He
studied that, wondering. It had to be the same thing.
Diet didn't account for the fact that the specks appeared
only when the patient was near death.</p>

<p>Nor did it account for the hard lump at the base of
the neck which he found in every case he could check.
That might be coincidence, but he doubted it.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it aggravated any other disease the
patient had and made seemingly simple diseases turn out
to be completely and rapidly fatal. Once syphilis had
been called "The Great Imitator". This gave promise of
being worse.</p>

<p>He shook his head, cursing his lack of equipment.
Each month more people were dying with these specks&mdash;and
he was helpless.</p>

<p>The concealed door broke open suddenly and a boy
thrust his head in. "Doc, there's a man here from Einstein.
Says his wife's dying."</p>

<p>The man was already coming into the room.</p>

<p>"She's powerful sick, Doc. Had a bellyache, fever,
began throwing up. Pains under her belly, like she's
had before. But this time it's awful."</p>

<p>Doc shot a few questions at him, frowning at what
he heard. Then he began packing the few things that
might help. There should be no appendicitis on Mars.
The bugs responsible for that shouldn't have adapted
to Mars-normal. But more and more infections found
ways to cross the border. Gangrene had been able to get
by without change, it seemed. So far, none of the contagious
infections except polio and the common cold
had made the jump.</p>

<p>This sounded like an advanced case, perhaps already
involving peritonitis.</p>

<p>So far, he'd been lucky with penicillin, but each time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
he used it with grave doubts of its action on the Mars-adapted
patients. If the appendix had burst, however, it
was the only possible treatment.</p>

<p>He riffled through his stores; There was ether enough,
fortunately. The villagers had made that for him out of
Martian plants, using their complicated fermentation
processes. He yelled for Jake, and the boy brought the
old man back a moment later.</p>

<p>"Jake, I'll need more of that narcotic stuff. I don't
want the woman writhing and tearing her stitches after
the ether wears off."</p>

<p>"Can't get it, Doc." Jake's eyes seemed to cloud as he
said it. "Distilling plant broke down. Doc, I don't like
this case. That woman's been to the hospital three times.
I hear she just got out recently. This might be a plant,
or they figure they can't help her."</p>

<p>"They're afraid to try anything on Mars-normal flesh.
They can't be proved wrong if they do nothing." Doc
finished packing his bag and got ready to go out. "Jake,
either I'm a doctor or I'm not. I can't worry when a
woman may be dying."</p>

<p>For a second, Jake's expression was stubborn. Then
the little crow's feet around his eyes deepened and the
dry chuckle was back in his voice. "Right, Dr. Feldman."
He flipped up his thumb and went off at a shuffling
run toward the tractor. Lou and the man from
Einstein followed Doc into the machine.</p>

<p>It was a silent ride, except for Doc's questions about
the sick woman. Her husband, George Lynn, was evasive
and probably ignorant. He admitted that Harriet
had been to the dispensary and small infirmary that
Southport called a hospital.</p>

<p>It was the only place in the entire Southern hemisphere
where an operation could be performed legally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Most cases had to go to Northport, but Chris had been
trying to expand. Apparently, she was determined to
make Southport into another major center before she
was called back to Earth.</p>

<p>Doc wondered why the villagers went there. They
had no medical insurance with the Lobby; they couldn't
afford it. Most villagers didn't have the cash, either.
They were forced to mortgage their future work and
that of their families to the drug plants that were run
by the Lobby.</p>

<p>"And they just turned your wife away?" Doc asked.
He couldn't quite believe that of Chris.</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno. She wouldn't talk much. Twice she
went and they gave her something. Cost every cent I
could borrow. Then this last time, they kept her a couple
days before they let me come and get her. But
now she's a lot worse."</p>

<p>Jake spun about, suddenly tense. "How'd you pay
them last time, George?"</p>

<p>"Why, they didn't ask. I told her she could put up
six months from me and the kids, but nobody said nothing
about it. Just gave her back to me." He frowned
slowly, his dull voice uncertain. "They told me they'd
done all they could, not to bring her back. That's why
she was so strong on getting Doc."</p>

<p>"I don't like it," Jake said flatly. "It stinks. They always
charge. George, did they suggest she get in touch
with Doc here?"</p>

<p>"Maybe they did, maybe not. Harriet did all the talking
with them. I just do what she tells me, and she said
to get Doc."</p>

<p>Jake swore. "It smells like a trap. Are you sure she's
sick, George?"</p>

<p>"I felt her head and she sure had a fever." George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Lynn was torn between his loyalties. "You know me,
Doc. You fixed me up that time I had the red pip. I
wouldn't pull nothing on you."</p>

<p>Doc had a feeling that Jake was probably right, but
he vetoed the suggestion that they stop to look for spies.
He had no time for that. If the woman was really sick,
he had to get to her at once, and even that might be
too late.</p>

<p>He remembered the woman, sickly from other treatment.
He'd been forced to remove her inflamed tonsils
a few months before. She'd whined and complained because
he couldn't spend all his time attending her. She
was a nag, a shrew, and a totally selfish woman. But that
was her <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'huband's'.">husband's</ins> worry, not his.</p>

<p>He dashed into the little house when they reached
Einstein, and his first glance confirmed what George
Lynn had said. The woman was sick, all right. She was
running a high fever. Much too high.</p>

<p>She began whining and protesting at his having taken
so long, but the pain soon forced her to stop.</p>

<p>"There may still be a chance," Doc told her husband
brusquely. He threw the cleanest sheet onto a table and
shoved it under the single light. "Keep out of the way&mdash;in
the other room, if you can all pile in there. This
isn't exactly aseptic, anyhow. You can boil a lot of water,
if you want to help."</p>

<p>It would give them something to do and he could
use the water to clean up. There was no time to wait
for it, however. He had to sterilize with alcohol and
carbolic acid, and hope. He bent over the woman, ripping
her thin gown across to make room for the operation.</p>

<p>Then he swore.</p>

<p>Across her abdomen was the unhealed wound of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
previous operation. They'd worked on her at <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'Southpost'.">Southport</ins>.
They must have removed the appendix and then
been shocked by the signs of infection. They weren't
supposed to release a sick patient, but there was an easy
out for them; they could remove her from the danger
of spreading an unknown infection. Some doctors must
have doped her up on sedatives and painkillers and sent
her home, knowing that she would call him.
For that matter, they might have noticed her unrecorded
tonsillectomy and considered her fair bait.</p>

<p>He grabbed the ether and slapped a cone over her
nose. She tried to protest; she never cooperated in anything.
But the fumes of the ether he dipped onto the
packing of the cone soon overcame that.</p>

<p>It was peritonitis, of course. The only thing to do was
to go in and scrape and clean as best he could. It was
a rotten job to have to do, and he should have had
help. But he gritted his teeth and began. He couldn't
trust anyone else to hold the instruments, even.</p>

<p>He cleaned the infection as best he could, knowing
there was almost no chance. He used all the penicillin
he dared. Then he began sewing up the incision. It
was all he could do, except for dressing the wound with
a sterile bandage. He reached for one, and stopped.</p>

<p>While he'd been working, the woman had died, far
more quietly than she had ever lived.</p>

<p>It was probably the only gracious act of her life.
But it was damning to Doc. They couldn't hide her
death, and any investigation would show that someone
had worked on her. To the Lobby, he would be the
one who had murdered her.</p>

<p>Jake was waiting in the tractor. He took one look at
Doc's face and made no inquiries.</p>

<p>They were more than a mile away when Jake pointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
back. Small in the distance, but distinct against the
sands, a gray Medical Corps tractor was coming. Either
they'd had a spy in the village or they'd guessed the
rate of her infection very closely. They must have
hoped to catch Doc in the act, and they'd barely
missed.</p>

<p>It wouldn't matter. Their pictures and what testimony
they could force from the village should be
enough to hang Doc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<h3>Research</h3>


<p>There had been a council the night following the
death of Harriet Lynn. Somehow the word had spread
through the villages and the chiefs had assembled in
Jake's village. But they had brought no solution, and
in the long run had been forced to accept Doc's decision.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to retire and hide," he'd told them,
surprised at his own decision, but grimly determined.
"You need me and I need you. I'll move every
day in hopes the Lobby police won't find me, but I
won't quit."</p>

<p>Now he was packing the things he most needed and
getting ready to move. The small bottles in which he
was trying to grow his cultures would need warmth.
He shoved them into an inner pocket, and began surveying
what must be left.</p>

<p>He was heading for his tractor when another battered
machine drove up. It had a girl of about fourteen, with
tears streaming down her face. She held out a pleading
hand, and her voice was scared. "It's&mdash;it's mama!"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Leibnitz."</p>

<p>Leibnitz was near enough. Doc started his tractor,
motioning for the girl to lead the way. The little dwelling
she led him to was at the edge of the village, looking
more poverty-stricken than most.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Chris Ryan, and three of the Medical Lobby police
were inside, waiting. The girl's mother was tied to the
bed, with a collection of medical instruments laid
out, but apparently the threat had been enough. No
actual injury had been inflicted. Probably none had
been intended seriously.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd answer that kind of call," Chris said
coldly.</p>

<p>He grinned sickly. They'd wasted no time. "I hear
it's more than you'll do, Chris. Congratulations! My patient
died. You're lucky."</p>

<p>"She was certainly dead when my men took her picture.
The print shows the death grimace clearly."</p>

<p>"Pretty. Frame it and keep it to comfort you when
you feel lonely," he snapped.</p>

<p>She struck him across the mouth with the handle of
her gun. Then she twisted out through the door
quickly, heading for the tractor that had been camouflaged
to look like those used by the villagers. The three
police led him behind her.</p>

<p>A shout went up, and people began to rush onto the
village street. But they were too late. By the time they
reached Southport, Doc could see a trail of battered
tractors behind, but there was nothing more the people
could do. Chris had her evidence and her prisoner.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Judge Ben Wilson might have been Jake's brother.
He was older and grayer, but the same expression lay
on his face. He must have been the family black sheep,
since his father had been president of Space Lobby. Instead
of inheriting the position, Wilson had remained
on Mars, safely out of the family's way.</p>

<p>He dropped the paper he was reading to frown at
Chris. "This the fellow?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>She began formal charges, but he cut them off. "Your
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'laywer'.">lawyer</ins> already had all that drawn up. I've been expecting
you, Doctor. Doctor! Hnnf! You'd do a lot better
home somewhere raising a flock of babies. Well, young
fellow&mdash;so you're Feldman. Okay, your trial comes up
day after tomorrow. Be a shame to lock you in Southport
jail, a man of your importance. We'll just keep
you here in the pending-trial room. It's a lot more comfortable."</p>

<p>Chris had been boiling slowly, and now she seemed
to blow her safety valve. "Judge Wilson, your methods
are your own business in local affairs. But this involves
Earth Medical Lobby. I demand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tch, <i>tch</i>!" The judge stared at her reprovingly.
"Young woman, you don't demand anything. This is
Mars. If Space Lobby can stand me, I guess our friends
over at Medical will have to. Or should I hold trial
right now and find Feldman innocent for lack of evidence?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't!" Chris cried. Then her face sobered
suddenly. "I apologize. Medical is pleased to leave
things in your hands, of course."</p>

<p>Wilson smiled. "Court's closed for today. Doc, I'll
show you your cell. It's right next to my study, so I'm
heading there anyhow."</p>

<p>He began shucking his robe while Chris went out
with the police, her voice sharp and continual.</p>

<p>The cell was both reasonably escape-proof and comfortable,
Doc saw, and he tried to thank the judge.</p>

<p>But the old man waved it aside. "Forget it. I just like
to see that little termagant taken down. But don't count
on my being soft. My methods may be a bit unusual&mdash;I
always did like the courtroom scenes in the old
books by that fellow Smith&mdash;but Space Lobby never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
had any reason to reverse my decisions. Anything you
need?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Doc told him, grinning in spite of his bitterness.
"A good biology lab and an electron microscope."</p>

<p>"Umm. How about a good optical mike and some
stains? Just got them in on the last shipment. Figure
they were meant for you anyhow, since Jake Mullens
asked me to order them."</p>

<p>He went out and came back with the box almost at
once. He snorted at Doc's incredulous thanks and
moved off, his bedroom slippers slapping against the
hard floor.</p>

<p>Doc stared after him. If he were a friend of Jake,
willing to invent some excuse to get a microscope here
... but it didn't matter. Friend or foe, his death sentence
would be equally fatal. And there were other
things to be thought of now. The little microscope was
an excellent one, though only a monocular.</p>

<p>Doc's hands trembled as he drew his cultures out and
began making up a slide. The sun offered the best
source of light near the window, and he adjusted the
instrument. Something began to come into view, but
too faintly to be really visible.</p>

<p>He remembered the stains, trying to recall his biology
courses. More by luck than skill, his fourth try gave him
results.</p>

<p>Under two thousand powers, he could just see details.
There were dozens of cells in his impure culture,
but only one seemed unfamiliar. It was a long, worm-like
thing, sharpened at both ends, with the three separate
nuclei that were typical of Martian life forms.
Nearby were a host of little rodlike squiggles just too
small to see clearly.</p>

<p>Martian life! No Martian bug had ever proved harm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>ful
to men. Yet this was no mutated cell or virus from
Earth; it was a new disease, completely different from
all others. It was one where all Earth's centuries of experience
with bacteria would be valueless&mdash;the first
Martian disease. Unless this was simply some accidental
contamination of his culture, not common to the other
samples. He worked on until the light was too faint
before putting the microscope aside.</p>

<p>By the time the trial commenced, however, he was
sure of the cause of the disease. It <i>was</i> Martian. Crude
as his cultures were, they had proved that.</p>

<p>The little courtroom was filled, mostly from the villages.
Lou was there, along with others he had come to
know. Then the sight of Jake caught Doc's eyes. The
darned fool had no business there; he could get too
closely mixed into the whole mess.</p>

<p>"Court's in session," Wilson announced. "Doc, you
represented by counsel?"</p>

<p>Jake's voice answered. "Your Honor, I represent the
defendant. I think you'll find my credentials in order."</p>

<p>Chris started to protest, but Wilson grinned. "Never
lost your standing in spite of that little fracas thirty
years ago, so far as I know. But the police thought you
were a witness when you came walking in. Figured you
were giving up."</p>

<p>"I never said so," Jake answered.</p>

<p>Chris was squirming angrily, but the florid man acting
as counsel for Medical Lobby shook his head, bending
over to whisper in her ear. He straightened. "No objection
to counsel for the defense. We recognize his
credentials."</p>

<p>"You're a fool, Matthews," the judge told him. "Jake
was smarter than half the rest of Legal Lobby before
he went native. Still can tie your tail <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'in'.">to</ins> a can. Okay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
let's start things. I'm too old to dawdle."</p>

<p>Doc lost track of most of what happened. This was
totally unlike anything on Earth, though it might have
been in keeping with the general casualness of the villages.
Maybe the ritualistic routine of the Lobbies was
driving those who could resist to the opposite extreme.</p>

<p>Chris was the final witness. Matthews drew comment
of Feldman's former crime from her, and Jake made
no protest, though Wilson seemed to expect one. Then
she began sewing his shroud. There wasn't a fact that
managed to emerge without slanting, though technically
correct. Jake sat quietly, smiling faintly, and making
no protests.</p>

<p>He got up lazily to cross-examine Chris. "Dr. Ryan,
when Daniel Feldman was examined by the Captain of
the <i>Navaho</i> after arriving at Mars station, did you identify
him then as having been Dr. Daniel Feldman?"</p>

<p>She glanced at Matthews, who seemed puzzled but
unconcerned. "That's correct," she admitted. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you later saw him delivered to the surface of
Mars. Is that also correct?" When she assented, Jake
hesitated. Then he frowned. "What did you do then?
Did you report him or send anyone to look after him
or anything like that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she answered. "He was no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did absolutely nothing about him after you
identified him and saw him delivered here? You're quite
sure of that?"</p>

<p>"I did nothing."</p>

<p>Jake stood quietly for a moment, then shrugged. "No
more questions."</p>

<p>Matthews finished things in a plea for the salvation
of all humanity from the danger of such men as Daniel
Feldman. He was looking smug, as was Chris.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilson turned to Jake. "Has the defense anything to
say?"</p>

<p>"A few things, Your Honor." Jake stood up, suddenly
looking certain and pleased. "We are happy to
admit everything factual the Lobby had testified. Daniel
Feldman performed a surgical operation on Harriet
Lynn in the village of Einstein. But when has it been
illegal for a member of the Medical profession to
perform an operation, even with small chance of success,
within an accepted area for such operation? There
has been no evidence adduced that any crime or act of
even unethical conduct was committed."</p>

<p>That brought Chris and Matthews to their feet. Wilson
was relaxed again, looking as if he'd swallowed a
whole cage of canaries. He banged his gavel down.</p>

<p>Jake picked up two ragged and dog-eared volumes
from his table. "Case of Harding vs. Southport, 2043,
establishes that a Lobby is responsible for any member
on Mars. It is also responsible for informing the authorities
of any criminal conduct on the part of its
members or any former member known to it. Failure to
report shall be considered an admission that the Lobby
recognizes the member as one in good standing and
accepts responsibility for that member's conduct.</p>

<p>"At the time Daniel Feldman arrived, Dr. Christina
Ryan was the highest appointed representative of Medical
Lobby in Southport, with full authority. She identified
Feldman as having been a doctor, without stipulating
any change in status. She made no further report
to any authority concerning Daniel Feldman's presence
here. It seems obvious that Medical Lobby at Southport
thereby accepted Daniel Feldman as a doctor in good
standing for whose conduct the Lobby accepted full
responsibility."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilson studied the book Jake held out, and nodded.
"Seems pretty clear-cut to me," he agreed, passing the
book on to Matthews. "There's still the charge that Dr.
Feldman operated outside a hospital."</p>

<p>"No reason he shouldn't," Jake said. He handed over
the other volume. "This is the charter for Medical
Lobby on Mars. Medical Lobby agrees to perform all
necessary surgical and medical services for the planet,
though at the signing of this charter there was no hospital
on Mars. Necessarily, Medical Lobby agreed to
perform surgery outside of any hospital, then. But to
make it plainer, there's a later paragraph&mdash;page 181&mdash;that
defines each hospital zone as extending not less than
three nor more than one hundred miles. Einstein is
about one hundred and ten miles from the nearest hospital
at Southport, so Einstein comes under the original
charter provisions. Dr. Feldman was forced by charter
provisions to protect the good name of his Lobby by
undertaking any necessary surgery in Einstein."</p>

<p>He waited until Matthews had scanned that book,
then took it back and began packing a big bag. Doc
saw that his possessions and the microscope were already
in the bag. The old man paid no attention to the
arguments of Matthews before the bench.</p>

<p>Abruptly Wilson pounded his gavel. "This court finds
that Dr. Daniel Feldman is qualified to practice all the
arts and skills of the medical profession on Mars and
that he acted ethically in the performance of his duties
in the case of the deceased Harriet Lynn," he ruled.
"The costs of the case shall be billed to Medical Lobby
of Southport."</p>

<p>He took off his robe and moved rapidly toward his
private quarters. Court was closed.</p>

<p>Doc got up shakily, not daring to believe fully what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
he had heard. He started toward Jake, trying to avoid
bumping into Chris. But she would not be avoided. She
stood in front of him, screaming accusations and threats
that reminded him of the only fight they'd ever had
during their brief marriage.</p>

<p>When she ran down, he finally met her eyes. "You're
a helluva doctor," he told her harshly. "You spend all
your time fighting me when there's a plague out there
that may be worse than any disease we've ever known.
Take a look at what lies under the black specks on your
corpses. You'll find the first Martian disease. And
maybe if you begin working on that now, you can learn
to be a real doctor in time to do something about it.
But I doubt it."</p>

<p>She fell back from him then. "Research! You've been
doing unauthorized research!"</p>

<p>"Prove it," he suggested. "But you'd be a lot smarter
to try some yourself, and to hell with your precious
rules."</p>

<p>He followed Jake out to the tractor.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the old man was sweating now. He
shook his head at Doc's look, and his grin was uncertain.</p>

<p>"Matthews is an incompetent," he said. "They could
have had you, Doc. That charter is so sloppy a man
can prove anything by it, and building a hospital here
did bring in Earth rules. Wilson went out on a limb in
letting you go. But I guess we got away with it. Let's
get out of here."</p>

<p>Doc climbed into the tractor more soberly. They had
escaped this time. But there would be another time,
and he was pretty sure that would be Chris' round. He
had no intention of giving up his research.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h3>Plague</h3>


<p>Dr. Feldman leaned back from his microscope and
lighted another bracky weed. He glanced about the
room and sighed wearily. Maybe he'd been better off
when he had no friends and couldn't risk the safety of
others in an effort to do research that was the highest
crime on two worlds.</p>

<p>The evidence of his work was hidden thirty feet beyond
his former laboratory in Jake's village, with a
tunnel that led from another root-cellar. The theory was
the old one that the best place to avoid discovery was
where you had already been discovered. If their spies
had identified his former hangout, they'd never expect
to have him set up research nearby. It was a nice theory,
but he wasn't sure of it.</p>

<p>Jake looked up from a cot where he'd been watching
the improvised culture incubator. "Stop tearing yourself
to bits, Doc. We know the danger and we're still
darned glad to have you here working on this."</p>

<p>"I'm trying to put myself together into a whole man,"
Doc told him. "But I seem to come out wholly a fool."</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure. Sometimes it takes a fool to get things
done; wise men wait too long for the right time. How's
the bug hunt?"</p>

<p>Doc grunted in disgust and swung back to the microscope.
Then he gave up as his tired eyes refused to
focus. "Why don't you people revolt?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"They tried it twice. But they were just a bunch of
pariahs shipped here to live in peonage. They couldn't
do much. The first time Earth cut off shipments and
starved them. Next time the villages had the answer
to that but the cities had to fight for Earth or starve,
so they whipped us. And there's always the threat that
Earth could send over unmanned war rockets loaded
with fissionables."</p>

<p>"So it's hopeless?"</p>

<p>"So nothing! The Lobbies are poisoning themselves,
like cutting off Medical service until they cut themselves
out of a job. It's just a matter of time. Go back
to the bugs, Doc."</p>

<p>Doc sighed and reached for his notes. "I wish I knew
more Martian history. I've been wondering whether this
bug may not have been what killed off the old Martians.
Something had to do it, the way they disappeared.
I wish I knew enough to make an investigation of those
ruins out there."</p>

<p>"Durwood!" Jake had propped himself on an elbow,
staring at Doc in surprise.</p>

<p>Doc scowled. "Clive Durwood, you mean? The archeologist
who dug up what little we know about the
ruins?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, before he went back to Earth and started living
off his lectures. He came here again three years ago
and dropped dead in Edison on the way to some other
ruins. Heart failure, they called it, though it was more
like the two old farmers who ran themselves to death
last month. I saw him when they buried him. His face
looked funny, and I think he had those little specks,
though I may remember wrong." He grimaced. "Mars
is tough, Doc; it has to be. Some of the plant seeds
Durwood found in the ruins grew! Maybe your bugs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
waited a million years till we came along."</p>

<p>"What about the farmers? Did they meet Durwood?"</p>

<p>Jake nodded. "Must have. He lived in their village
most of the time."</p>

<p>Doc went through his notes. He'd asked for reports
on all deaths, and he finally found the account. The
two old men had been nervous and fidgety for weeks.
They were twins, living by themselves, and nobody
paid much attention. Then one morning both were
seen running wildly in circles. The village managed to
tie them up, but they died of exhaustion shortly after.</p>

<p>It wasn't a pretty picture. The disease might have an
incubation period of nearly fifteen years, judging by
the length of time it had taken to hit Durwood. It must
spread from person to person during an early contagious
stage, leaving widening circles behind Durwood
and those first infected. When matured, any other sickness
would set it off, with few symptoms of its own.
But without help, it still killed its victims, apparently
driving them madly toward frenzied physical effort.</p>

<p>He studied the culture on a slide again. He'd tried
Koch's method to get a pure strain, splattering the bugs
onto a native starchy root and plucking off individual
colonies. About twenty specimens had been treated
with every chemical he could find. So far he'd found a
few things that seemed to stop their growth, but nothing
that killed them, except stuff far too harsh to use
in living tissue.</p>

<p>He had nearly forty cases of deaths that showed
symptoms now, and he went back over them, looking
for anything in common that went back ten to twenty
years before death. There were no rashes nor blisters.
A few had had apparent colds, but such were too common
to mean anything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Only one thing appeared, about fourteen years before
their deaths. The people interviewed about the victims
might be vague about most things, but they remembered
the time when "Jim had the jumping headache."</p>

<p>"Jake," Doc called, "what's jumping headache? Most
people seem to have it some time or other, but I haven't
run across a case of it."</p>

<p>"Sure you have, Doc. Mamie Brander's little girl a
few weeks ago. Feels like your pulse is going to rip
your skull off, right here. Can't eat because chewing
drives you crazy. Back of your head, neck and shoulders
swell up for about a week. Then it goes away."</p>

<p>Then it goes away&mdash;for fourteen years, until it comes
back to kill!</p>

<p>Doc stared at his charts in sudden horror. It was a
new disease&mdash;thought to be some virus, but not considered
dangerous. Selznik's migraine, according to medical
usage; you treated it with hot pads and anodyne,
and it went away easily enough.</p>

<p>He'd seen hundreds of such cases on Earth. There
must be millions who had been hit by it. The patent-medicine
branch of the Lobby had even brought out
something called Nograine to use for self-treatment.</p>

<p>"Something important?" Jake wanted to know.</p>

<p>Feldman nodded. "How much weight do you swing
in other villages, Jake?"</p>

<p>"People sort of do me favors when I ask," Jake admitted.
"Like swiping those medical journals from
Northport for you, or like Molly Badger getting that
job as maid to spy on Chris Ryan. Name it and I'll do
my best."</p>

<p>Doc had a vague idea of village politics, but he had
more important things to think of. Most of his foul
mood had disappeared with the clue he'd stumbled on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and his chief worry now was to clinch the facts.</p>

<p>Feldman considered the problem. "I want a report on
every case of jumping headache in every village&mdash;who
had it, when, and how old they were. This place first,
but every village you can reach. And I'll want someone
to take a letter to Chris Ryan."</p>

<p>Jake frowned at that, but went out to issue instructions.
Doc sat down at a battered old typewriter. Writing
Chris might do no good, but some warning had to
be gotten through to Earth, where the vast resources
of Medical Lobby could be thrown into the task of
finding the cause and cure of the disease. The connection
with Selznik's migraine had to be reported. If something
could blast the Lobby into action, it wouldn't matter
quite so much what they did to him. He wasn't
foolish enough to expect gratitude from them, but he
was getting used to the idea that his days were numbered.
The plague was more important than what happened
to him.</p>

<p>The letter had been dispatched by the time Jake returned.
"Here's the dope for this village. Everybody
accounted for except you."</p>

<p>"Never had it, Jake." Feldman went down the list.
"Most of it fourteen years ago. That fits. About the
only exceptions are the kids who seem to get it between
the ages of two and three. Eighty-seven out of ninety-one!"</p>

<p>He stared at the figures sickly. Most of the village
not only had the plague but must be near the end of
the incubation period. It looked as if most of the village
would be dead before another year passed.</p>

<p>"Bad?" Jake asked.</p>

<p>"The first symptom of Martian fever."</p>

<p>The old man whistled, the lines around his eyes tight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>ening.
"Must be me," he decided. "I'm the guy who
must have brought it here, then. I used to spend a lot
of time with Durwood at his diggings!"</p>

<p>There was a constant commotion all that day and the
next as runners went out to the villages and came back
with reports. The variation from village to village was
only slight. Most of Mars seemed to have advanced cases
of Martian fever.</p>

<p>Without animals for investigation and study, real research
was difficult. Doc also needed an electron microscope.
He was reasonably sure that the disease must
travel through the nerves, but he had found no proof
beyond the hard lump at the base of the neck. There
it was a fair-sized organism. Elsewhere he could find
nothing, until the black specks developed.</p>

<p>His eyes ached from trying to see more than was
visible in the microscope. The tantalizing suggestions
of filaments around the nuclei might be the form of
plague that was contagious. They might even be the
true form of the bug, with the bigger cell only a transition
stage. There were a number of diseases that involved
complicated changes in the organisms that
caused them. But he couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>He finally buried his head in his hands, trying to do
by pure thought what he couldn't do in any other way.
And even there, he lacked training. He was a doctor,
not a xenobiologist. Research training had been taboo
in school, except for a favored few.</p>

<p>The reports continued to come in, confirming the
danger. They seemed to have the worst plague on their
hands in all human history; and nobody who could do
anything about it even knew of it.</p>

<p>"Molly reports that your letter got some results,"
Jake reported. "Chris Ryan brought home one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
electron microscopes and a bunch of equipment from
the hospital pathology room. Think she'll get anywhere?"</p>

<p>Doc doubted it. Damn it, he hadn't meant for her to
try it, though she might have authority for routine experiments.
But it was like her to refuse to pass on the
word without trying to prove her own suspicion of
him first.</p>

<p>He tried to comfort himself with the fact that some
men were immune, or seemed so; about three out of a
hundred showed no signs. If that immunity was hereditary,
it might save the race. If not....</p>

<p>Jake came in at twilight with a grim face. "More
news from Molly. The Lobby is starting out to comb
every village with a fault-finder, starting here. And this
hole will show up like a sore thumb. Better start packing.
We gotta be out of here in less than an hour!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h3>Fool</h3>


<p>Three days later, Doc saw his first runner.</p>

<p>The tractor was churning through the sand just before
sundown, heading toward another one-night stand
at a new village. Lou was driving, while Doc and Jake
brooded silently in the back, paying no attention to the
colors that were blazoned over the dunes. The cat-and-mouse
game was getting to Doc. There was no real assurance
that the village they were approaching might
not be the target the Lobby had chosen for the next
investigation.</p>

<p>Lou braked the tractor to a sudden halt, and pointed.</p>

<p>A figure was running frantically over one of the low
dunes with the little red sun behind him. He seemed
headed toward them, but as he drew nearer they could
see that he had no definite direction. He simply ran,
pumping his legs frantically as if all the devils of hell
were after him. His body swayed from side to side in
exhaustion, but his arms and legs pumped on.</p>

<p>"Stop him!" Jake ordered, and Lou swung the tractor.
It halted squarely in the runner's path, and the figure
struck against it and toppled.</p>

<p>The legs went on pumping, digging into the dirt and
gravel, but the man was too far gone to rise. Jake and
Lou shoved him through the doors into the tractor and
Doc yanked off his aspirator.</p>

<p>The man was giving vent to a kind of ululating cry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
weakened now almost to a whine that rose and fell with
the motion of his legs. Sweat had once streaked his
haggard face, but it was dry and blanched to a pasty
gray.</p>

<p>Doc injected enough narcotic to quiet a maddened
bull. It had no effect, except to upset the rhythm of the
arms and legs. It took five more minutes for the man
to die.</p>

<p>The specks were larger this time&mdash;the size of periods
in twelve-point type. The lump at the base of the skull
was as big as a small hen's egg.</p>

<p>"From Edison, like the others so far. Jack Kooley,"
Jake answered Doc's question. "Durwood spent a lot of
time here on his first expedition, so it's getting the worst
of it."</p>

<p>Doc pulled the aspirator mask back over the man's
face and they carried him out and laid him on a low
dune. They couldn't risk returning the corpse to its
people.</p>

<p>This was only the primary circle of infection, direct
from Durwood. The second circle could be ten times
as large, as the infection spread from one to a few to
many. So far it was localized. But it wouldn't stay that
way.</p>

<p>Doc climbed slowly out of the tractor, lugging his
small supplies of equipment, while Jake made arrangements
for them to spend the night in a deserted house.
But the figure of the runner and his own failures to
find more about the disease kept haunting Doc. He
began setting up his equipment grimly.</p>

<p>"Better get some sleep," Jake suggested. "You're a
mite more tired than you think. Anyhow, I thought
you told me you couldn't do any more with what you've
got."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Feldman looked at the supplies he had spread out,
and shook his head wearily. He'd been over every
chemical and combination a dozen times, without results
that showed in the limited magnification of the optical
mike.</p>

<p>He snapped the case shut and hit the rude table with
the heel of his hand. "There are other supplies. Jake,
do you have any signal to get in touch with Molly
at the Ryan house?"</p>

<p>"Three raps on the rear left window. I'll get Lou."</p>

<p>"No!" Doc came to his feet, reaching for his jacket.
"They're looking for three men now. It's safer if I go
alone&mdash;and I'm the only one who knows what supplies
are needed. With luck, I may even get the electron mike.
Got a gun I can borrow?"</p>

<p>Jake found one somewhere, an old revolver with a
few loads. He began protesting, but Doc overruled him
sharply. Three men could no more fight off the police
than one, if they were spotted. He swung toward the
tractor.</p>

<p>"You'd better start spreading the word on everything
we know. If people realize they're already safe or
doomed it'll be better than having them going crazy to
avoid contagion."</p>

<p>"Most of the villages know already," Jake told him.
"And damn it, get back here, Doc. If you can't make
it, turn tail quick, and we'll think of something else."</p>

<p>Southport seemed normal enough as Doc drove
through its streets. The stereo house was open, and the
little shops were brightly lighted. He stopped once to
pull a copy of Southport's little newspaper from a dispenser.
All was quiet on its front page, too.</p>

<p>As usual, though, the facts were buried inside. The
editorial was pouring too much oil on the waters in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
lauding of the role of Medical Lobby on Mars for no
apparent reason. The death notices no longer listed the
cause of death. Medical knew something was up, at least,
and was worried.</p>

<p>He parked the tractor behind Chris' house and slipped
to the proper window. Everything was seemingly quiet
there. At his knock, the shade was drawn back, and he
caught a brief glimpse of Molly looking out. A moment
later she opened the rear lock to let him into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Shh. She's still up, I think. What can I do, Doc?"</p>

<p>He tried to smile at her. "Hide me until it's safe to
get into her laboratory. I've got to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inner kitchen was kicked open and Chris stood
beyond it, holding a cocked gun in her hand.</p>

<p>"It took longer than I expected, Dan," she said
quietly. "But after your letter, I knew you'd swallow the
bait. You bloody fool! Did you really believe I'd start
doing research here just because of your imaginings?"</p>

<p>He slumped slowly back against the sink. "So this is
a fool's errand, then? There never was any equipment
here?"</p>

<p>"The equipment's here&mdash;in my office. I guessed your
spies would report it, so it had to be here. But it won't
help you now, pariah Feldman!"</p>

<p>He came from his braced position against the sink
like a spring uncoiling. He expected her to shoot, but
hoped the surprise would ruin her aim. Then it was
too late, and his boot hit the gun savagely, knocking it
from her hand. Life in the villages had hardened him
surprisingly. She was comparatively helpless in his
hands. A few minutes later, he had her bound securely
with surgical tape Molly brought him. She raged furiously
in the chair where he'd dumped her, then gave up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"They'll get you, Daniel Feldman!" Surprisingly,
there was no rage in her voice now. "You won't get
away from us. The planet isn't big enough."</p>

<p>"I got away from your trial," he reminded her. "And
I got away and lived when you left me without a
chance on the ground of the spaceport."</p>

<p>She laughed harshly. "<i>You</i> got away then? You fool,
who do you think gave you the extra battery so you
could live long enough to be helped at the spaceport?
Who hired a fool like Matthews so you wouldn't get the
death sentence you deserved? Who let you get away
as an herb doctor for months before you set yourself
up as God and a traitor to mankind again?"</p>

<p>It shook him, as it was probably intended to do. How
had she known about the extra battery? He'd always
assumed that Ben had returned to give it to him. But
in that case, Chris couldn't know of it. Then he hardened
himself again. In the old days, she'd always had
one trump card he couldn't beat and hadn't expected.
But too much was involved for games now.</p>

<p>"Any police around, Molly?" he asked.</p>

<p>Molly came back a minute later to report that everything
looked clear and to show him where the equipment
had been set up in Chris' office. It was all there,
including the electron mike&mdash;a beautiful little portable
model. There was even a small incubator with its own
heat source into which he immediately transferred the
little bottles he'd been keeping warm against his skin.
Most of the equipment had never been unpacked, which
made loading it onto his tractor ridiculously easy.</p>

<p>"Better come with me now, Molly," he suggested at
last. Then he turned to Chris, who was watching him
with almost no expression. "You can wriggle your chair
to the phone in half an hour, I guess. Knock the phone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
off and yell for help. It's better than you deserve, unless
you really did leave me that battery."</p>

<p>"You won't get away with it," she told him again,
calmly this time.</p>

<p>"No," he admitted. "Probably not. But maybe the
human race will, if I have time to find an answer to the
plague you won't see under your nose. But you won't
get away with it, either. In the long run, your kind
never do."</p>

<p>Molly was sniffling as they drove away. It had probably
been the best life she'd known, Doc supposed.
Chris could be kind to menials. But now Molly's work
was done, and she'd have to disappear into the villages.
He let her off at the first village and drove on alone.
He was itching to get to the microscope now, hardly
able to wait through the long journey back to Jake.
His impatience grew with each mile.</p>

<p>Finally he gave up. He swung the tractor into a small
gulley between sand dunes, left the motor idling and
pulled down the shades the villagers used for blackout
traveling. There was power enough for the mike here,
and the cab was big enough for what he had to do.</p>

<p>He mounted the mike on the tractor seat and began
laying out the collection of smears and cultures he had
brought. It had been years since he'd made a film for
the electron mike, but he found it all came back to him
as he worked.</p>

<p>His hands were sweating with tension as he inserted
the first film into the chamber. He had the magnetic
"lenses" set for twenty thousand power, but a quick
glance showed it was too weak. He raised the power
to fifty thousand.</p>

<p>The filaments were there, clear and distinct.</p>

<p>He turned on the little tape recorder that had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
part of Chris' equipment and set the microphone where
he could dictate into it without stopping to make
clumsy notes. He readjusted the focus carefully, carrying
on a running commentary.</p>

<p>Then he gasped. Each of the little filaments carried
three tiny darker sections; each was a cell, complete in itself,
with the typical Martian triple nucleus.</p>

<p>He put a film with a tiny section of the nerve tissue
from a corpse into the chamber next, and again a quick
glance at the screen was enough. The filaments were
there, thickly crowded among nerve cells. They <i>did</i>
travel along the nerves to reach the base of the brain
before the larger lump could form.</p>

<p>A specimen from one of the black specks was even
more interesting. The filaments were there, but some
were changed or changing into tiny, round cells, also
with the triple dark spots of nuclei. Those must be the
final form that was released to infect others. Probably
at first these multiplied directly in epithelial tissue, so
that there was a rapid contagion of infection. Eventually,
they must form the filaments that invaded the
nerves and caused the brief bodily reaction that was
Selznik's migraine. Then the body adapted to them and
they began to incubate slowly, developing into the
large cells he had first seen. When "ripe", the big cells
broke apart into millions of the tiny round ones that
went back to the nerve endings, causing the black spots
and killing the host.</p>

<p>He knew his enemy now, at least.</p>

<p>He reached for the controls, increasing the magnification.
He would lose resolution, but he might find
something more at the extreme limits of the mike.</p>

<p>Something wet and cold gushed into his face. He
jerked back, trying to wipe it off, but it was already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
evaporating, and there was a thick, acrid odor in the
cab. He grabbed for his aspirator, then tried to reach
the airlock. But paralysis was already spreading through
him, and he toppled to the floor before he could escape.</p>

<p>When he came to, it was morning outside, and Chris
was waiting inside the cab with two big Lobby policemen.
A hypo in her hand must have been what revived
him.</p>

<p>She touched the electron microscope with something
like affection. "The Lobby technicians did a good job
on this, don't you think, Dan? I warned you, but you
wouldn't listen. And now we've even got your own
taped words to prove you were doing forbidden research.
Fool!"</p>

<p>She shook her head pityingly as the tractor began
moving with two others toward Southport.</p>

<p>"You and your phony diseases. A little skin disorder,
Selznik's migraine, and a few cases of psychosis to make
a new disease. Do you think Medical Lobby can't check
on such simple things? Or didn't you expect us to hear
of your open talk of revolt and realize you were planning
to create some new germ to wipe out the Earth
forces. Maybe those runners of yours were real, mass
murderer!"</p>

<p>She drew out another hypo and shoved the needle
into his arm. Necrosynth&mdash;enough to keep him unconscious
for twenty-four hours. He started to curse her,
but the drug acted before he could complete the
thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<h3>Judgment</h3>


<p>Doc woke to see sunlight shining through a heavily
barred window that must be in the official Southport
jail. He waited a few minutes for his head to clear and
then sat up; necrosynth left no hangover, at least.</p>

<p>The sound of steps outside was followed by the
squeak of a key in the lock. "Fifteen minutes, Judge
Wilson," a voice said.</p>

<p>"Thank you, officer." Wilson came into the cell, carrying
a tray of breakfast and a copy of the Northport
<i>Gazette</i>. He began unloading bracky weeds from his
pocket while Doc attacked the breakfast.</p>

<p>"They tossed the book at you, Doc," he said. "You
haven't got a chance, and there's nothing the villages
can do. Trial's set for tomorrow at Northport, and it's
in closed session. We can't get you off this time."</p>

<p>Doc nodded. "Thanks for coming, even if there's
nothing you can do. I've been living on borrowed time
for a year, anyhow, so I have no right to kick. But
who's 'we'?"</p>

<p>"The villages. I've been part of their organization for
years." The old man sighed heavily. "You might say a
revolution has been going on since I can remember,
though most villagers don't know it. We've just been
waiting our time. Now we've stopped waiting and the
rifles will be coming out&mdash;rifles made in village shops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
The villages are going to rebel, even if we're all dead
of plague in a month."</p>

<p>Doc Feldman nodded and reached for the bracky. He
knew that this was their way of trying to make him
feel his work hadn't been for nothing, and he was grateful
for Wilson's visit. "It was a good year for me.
Damned good. But time's running short. I'd better brief
you on the latest on the plague."</p>

<p>Wilson began making notes until Doc was finished.
Finally he got up as steps sounded from the hall. "Anything
else?"</p>

<p>"Just a guess. A lot of Earth germs can't live in Mars-normal
flesh; maybe this can't live in Earth-normal. Tell
them so long for me."</p>

<p>"So long, Doc." He shook hands briefly and was waiting
at the door when the guard opened it.</p>

<p>An hour later, the Lobby police took Feldman to the
Northport shuttle rocket. They had some trouble on
the way; a runner cut down the street, with the crowds
frantically rushing out of his way. Terror was reaching
the cities already.</p>

<p>Doc flashed a look at Chris. "Mob hysteria. Like flying
saucers and wriggly tops, I suppose?" he asked, before
the guard could stop him.</p>

<p>They locked his legs, but left his hands free in the
rocket. He unfolded the paper Wilson had brought and
buried his face in it. Then he swore. They <i>were</i> explaining
the runners as a case of mob hysteria!</p>

<p>Northport was calmer. Apparently they had yet to
have first-hand experience with the plague. But now
nothing seemed quite real to Doc, even when they
locked him into the big Northport jail. The whole ritual
of the Lobbies seemed like a fantasy after the villages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>It snapped back into focus, however, when they led
him into the trial room of the Medical Lobby building.
It was a smaller version of his trial on Earth. Fear
washed in by association. The complete lack of humanity
in the procedure was something from a half-remembered
and horrible past.</p>

<p>The presiding officer asked the routine question: "Is
the prisoner represented by counsel?"</p>

<p>Blane, the dapper little prosecutor, arose quickly.
"The prisoner is a pariah, Sir Magistrate."</p>

<p>"Very well. The court will accept the protective
function for the prisoner. You may proceed."</p>

<p><i>I'll be judge, I'll be jury.</i> And prosecution and defense.
It made for a lot less trouble. Of course, if Space
Lobby had asserted interest, it would have gone to a
supposedly neutral court. But as usual, Space was happy
to leave it in the hands of Medical.</p>

<p>The tape was played as evidence. Doc frowned. The
words were his, but there had been a lot of editing
that subtly changed the import of his notes.</p>

<p>"I protest," he challenged. "It's not an accurate version."</p>

<p>The Lobby magistrate turned a wooden face to him.
"Does the prisoner have a different version to introduce?"</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The evidence is accepted. One of the prisoner's six
protests will be charged against him."</p>

<p>Blane smiled smoothly and held up a small package.
"We wish to introduce this drug as evidence that the
prisoner is a confirmed addict, morally irresponsible
under addiction. This is a package of so-called bracky
weed, a vile and noxious substance found in his possession."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has alkaloids no more harmful than nicotine,"
Feldman stated sharply.</p>

<p>"Do you contend that you find the taste pleasing?"
Blane asked.</p>

<p>"It's bitter, but I've gotten used to it."</p>

<p>"I've tasted it," the magistrate said. "Evidence accepted.
Two deductions, one for irregularity of presentation."</p>

<p>Doc shrugged and sat back. He'd tested his rights
and found what he expected. It was hard to see now
how he had ever accepted such procedure. Jake must
be right; they'd been in power too long, and were making
the mistake of taking the velvet glove off the iron
fist and flailing about for the sheer pleasure of power.</p>

<p>It dragged on, while he became a greater and greater
monster on the record. But finally it was over, and the
magistrate turned to Feldman. "You may present your
defense."</p>

<p>"I ask complete freedom of expression," Doc said
formally.</p>

<p>The magistrate nodded. "This is a closed court. Permission
granted. The recording will be scrambled."</p>

<p>The last bit ruined most of the purpose Doc had in
mind. But it was too late to change. He could only hope
that some one of the Medical men present would remember
something of what he said.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say for myself," he began. "It
would be useless. But I had to do what I did. There's
a plague outside. I've studied that plague, and I have
knowledge which must be used against it...."</p>

<p>He sat down in three minutes. It had been useless.</p>

<p>Blane arose, with a smile still plastered on his face.
"We, of course, recognize the existence of a new contagion,
but I believe we have established that this is one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
disseminated by the prisoner himself, and probably not
directly contagious. There have been many cases of fanatics
ready to destroy humanity to eliminate those
they hate. Now, surely, the prisoner has himself left no
question of his attitude. He asserts he has knowledge
and skill greater than the entire Medical Research staff.
He has attempted to intimidate us by threats. He is
clearly psychopathic, and dangerously so. The prosecution
rests."</p>

<p>The guards took Doc into the anteroom, where he
was supposed to hear nothing that went on. But their
curiosity was stronger than their discretion, and the
door remained a trifle ajar.</p>

<p>The magistrate began the discussion. "The case seems
firm enough. It's fortunate Dr. Ryan acted so quickly,
with some of the people getting nervous. Perhaps it
might be wise to publicize our verdict."</p>

<p>"My thought exactly," Blane agreed. "If we show
Feldman is responsible and that Medical is eliminating
the source of the infection, it may have a stabilizing
effect."</p>

<p>"Let's hope so. The sentence will have to be death,
of course. We can't let such a rebellious psychopath
live. But this needs something more, it seems. You've
prepared a recommendation, I suppose."</p>

<p>"There was the case of Albrecht Delier," Blane suggested.
"Something like that should have good publicity
impact."</p>

<p>It struck Doc that they sounded as if they believed
themselves&mdash;as the witch-burners had believed in
witches. He was sweating when the guards led him before
the bench.</p>

<p>The magistrate rolled a pen slowly across his fingers
as his eyes raked Feldman. "Pariah Daniel Feldman, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
have been found guilty on all counts. Furthermore, your
guilt must be shared by that entire section of Mars
known as the villages. Therefore the entire section shall
be banned and forbidden any and all services of the
Medical Lobby for a period of one year."</p>

<p>"Sir Magistrate!" One of the members of Southport
Hospital staff was on his feet. "Sir Magistrate, we can't
cut them off completely."</p>

<p>"We must, Dr. Harkness. I appreciate the fine humanitarian
tradition of our Lobby which lies behind
your protest, but at such a time as this the good of the
body politic requires drastic measures. Why not see me
after court, and we can discuss it then?"</p>

<p>He turned back to Feldman, and his face was severe.</p>

<p>"The same education which has produced such fine
young men as Dr. Harkness was wasted on you and
perverted to endanger the whole race. No punishment
can equal your crimes, but there is one previously invoked
for a particularly horrible case, and it seems fitting
that you should be the fourth so sentenced.</p>

<p>"Daniel Feldman, you are sentenced to be taken in
to space beyond planetary limits, together with all material
used by you in the furtherance of your criminal
acts. There you shall be placed into a spacesuit containing
sufficient oxygen for one hour of life, and no more.
You and your contaminated possessions shall then be
released into space, to drift there through all eternity as
a warning to other men.</p>

<p>"This sentence shall be executed at the earliest possible
moment, and Dr. Christina Ryan is hereby commissioned
to observe such execution. And may God
have mercy on your soul!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<h3>Execution</h3>


<p>The hours of waiting were blurred for Doc. There
were periods when fear clogged his throat and left him
gasping with the need to scream and beat his cell walls.
There were also times when it didn't seem to matter,
and when his only thoughts were for the villages and
the plague.</p>

<p>They brought him the papers, where he was painted
as a monster beside whom Jack the Ripper and Albrecht
Delier were gentle amateurs. They were trying
to focus all fear and resentment on him. Maybe it was
working. There were screaming crowds outside the jail,
and the noise of their hatred was strong enough to carry
through even the atmosphere of Mars. But there were
also signs that the Lobby was worried, as if afraid that
some attempt might still be made to rescue him.</p>

<p>He'd looked forward to the trip to the airport as a
way of judging public reaction. But apparently the
Lobby had no desire to test that. The guards led him
up to the roof of the jail, where a rocket was waiting.
The landing space was too small for one of the station
shuttles, but a little Northport-Southport shuttle was
parked there after what must have been a difficult set-down.
The guards tested Doc's manacles and forced
him into the shuttle.</p>

<p>Inside, Chris was waiting, carrying an official automatic.
There was also a young pilot, looking nervous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and unhappy. He was muttering under his breath as
the guards locked Doc's legs to a seat and left.</p>

<p>"All right," Chris ordered. "Up ship!"</p>

<p>"I tell you we're overweight with you. I wasn't counting
on three for the trip," the pilot protested. "The
only thing that will get this into orbit with the station
is faith. I'm loaded with every drop of fuel she'll hold
and it still isn't enough."</p>

<p>"That's your problem," Chris told him firmly.
"You've got your orders, and so have I. Up ship!"</p>

<p>If she had her own worries about the shuttle, she
didn't show it. Chris had never been afraid to do what
she felt she should. The pilot stared at her doubtfully
and finally turned back to his controls, still muttering.</p>

<p>The shuttle lifted sluggishly, but there was no great
difficulty. Doc could see that there was even some fuel
remaining when they slipped into the tube at the orbital
station. Chris went out, and other guards came
in to free him.</p>

<p>"So long, Dr. Feldman," the pilot called softly as they
led him out. Then the guards shoved him through the
airlock into the station. Fifteen minutes later he was
locked into one of the cabins of the <i>Iroquois</i>, with all
his possessions stacked beside him.</p>

<p>He grinned wryly. As an honest worker on the
<i>Navaho</i> he'd been treated like an animal. Now, as a human
fiend, he was installed in a luxury cabin of the
finest ship of the fleet, with constant spin to give a feeling
of weight and more room than the entire tube crew
had known.</p>

<p>He roamed the cabin until he found a little collapsible
table. He set the electron microscope up on that and
plugged it in. It seemed a shame that good equipment
should be wasted along with his life. He wondered if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
they would really throw it out into space with him.
Probably they would.</p>

<p>He pushed a button on the call board over the table
and asked for the steward. There was a long wait, as
if the procedure were being checked with some authority,
but finally he received a surly acknowledgement.
"Steward. Whatcha want?"</p>

<p>"How's the chance of getting some food?"</p>

<p>"You're on first-class."</p>

<p>They could afford it, Doc decided. He wouldn't cost
them much, considering the distance he was going.
"Bring me two complete dinners&mdash;one Earth-normal
and one Mars-normal."</p>

<p>"Okay, Feldman. But if you think you can suicide
that way, you're wrong. You may be sick, but you'll
be alive when they dump you."</p>

<p>A sharp click interrupted him. "That's enough, Steward.
Captain Everts speaking. Dr. Feldman, you have
my apologies. Until you reach your destination, you
are my passenger and entitled to every consideration of
any other passenger except freedom of movement
through the ship. I am always available for legitimate
complaints."</p>

<p>Feldman shook his head. He'd heard of such men.
But he'd thought the species extinct.</p>

<p>The steward brought his food in a thoroughly chastened
manner. He managed to find space for it and
came to attention. "Is that all&mdash;sir?"</p>

<p>For a moment, as the smell of real steak reached him,
Doc regretted the fact that his metabolism had been
switched. Then he shrugged. A little wouldn't hurt him,
though there was no proper nourishment in it. He
squeezed some of the gravy and bits of meat into one
of his bottles, sticking to his purpose; then he fell to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
on the rest. But after a few bites, it was queerly unsatisfactory.
The seemingly unappealing Mars-normal
ragout suited his current tastes better, after all.</p>

<p>Once the steward had cleared away the dishes, Doc
went to work. It was better than wasting his time in
dread. He might even be able to leave some notes behind.</p>

<p>A gong sounded, and a red light warned him that
acceleration was due. He finished with his bottles, put
them into the incubator, and piled into his bunk, swallowing
one of the tablets of morphetal the ship furnished.</p>

<p>Acceleration had ended, and a simple breakfast was
waiting when he awoke. There was also a red flashing
light over the call board. He flipped the switch while
reaching for the coffee.</p>

<p>"Captain Everts," the speaker said. "May I join you
in your cabin?"</p>

<p>"Come ahead," Feldman invited. He cut off the switch
and glanced at the clock on the wall. There were less
than eleven hours left to him.</p>

<p>Everts was a trim man of forty, erect but not rigid.
There was neither friendliness nor hostility in his
glance. His words were courteous as Doc motioned toward
the tray of breakfast. "I've already eaten, thank
you."</p>

<p>He accepted a chair. His voice was apologetic when
he began. "This is a personal matter which I perhaps
have no right to bring up. But my wife is greatly worried
about this plague. I violate no confidence in telling
you there is considerable unease, even on Earth, according
to messages I have received. The ship physician believes
Mrs. Everts may have the plague, but isn't sure
of the symptoms. I understand you are quite expert."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Doc wondered about the physician. Apparently there
was another man who placed his patients above anything
else, though he was probably meticulous about
obeying all actual rules. There was no law against listening
to a pariah, at least.</p>

<p>"When did she have Selznik's migraine?" he asked.</p>

<p>"About thirteen years ago. We went through it together,
shortly after having our metabolism switched
during the food shortage of '88."</p>

<p>Doc felt carefully at the base of the Captain's skull;
the swelling was there. He asked a few questions, but
there could be no doubt.</p>

<p>"Both of you must have it, Captain, though it won't
mature for another year. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"There's no hope, then?"</p>

<p>Doc studied the man. But Everts wasn't the sort to
dicker even for his life. "Nothing that I've found, Captain.
I have a clue, but I'm still working on it. Perhaps
if I could leave a few notes for your physician&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Everts' turn to shake his head. "I'm sorry, Dr.
Feldman. I have orders to burn out your cabin when
you leave. But thank you." He got to his feet and left
as quietly and erectly as he had entered.</p>

<p>Doc tore up his notes bitterly. He paced his cabin
slowly, reading out the hours while his eyes lingered on
the little bottle of cultures. At times the fear grew in
him, but he mastered it. There was half an hour left
when he began opening the little bottles and making his
films.</p>

<p>He was still not finished when steps echoed down
the hall, but he was reasonably sure of his results. The
bug could not grow in Earth-normal tissue.</p>

<p>Three men entered the room. One of them, dressed
in a spacesuit, held out another suit to him. The other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
two began gathering up everything in the cabin and
stowing it neatly into a sack designed to protect freight
for a limited time in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Doc forced his hands to steadiness with foolish pride
and began climbing into the suit. He reached for the
helmet, but the man shook his head, pointing to the
oxygen gauge. There would be exactly one hour's supply
of oxygen when he was thrown out and it still
lacked five minutes of the deadline.</p>

<p>They marched him down the hallway, to meet Everts
coming toward them. There were still three minutes
left when they reached the airlock, with its inner door
already open. The spacesuited man climbed into it and
began strapping down so that the rush of air would not
sweep him outward when the other seal was released.</p>

<p>Doc had saved one bracky weed. Now he raised it
to his lips, fumbling for a light.</p>

<p>Everts stepped forward and flipped a lighter. Doc inhaled
deeply. Fear was thick in every muscle, and he
needed the smoke desperately. Then he caught himself.</p>

<p>"Better change your metabolism back to Earth-normal,
Captain Everts," he said, and his voice was so normal
that he hardly recognized it.</p>

<p>Everts' eyes widened briefly. The man bowed faintly.
"Thank you, Dr. Feldman."</p>

<p>It was ridiculous, impossible, and yet there was a curious
relief at the formality of it. It was like something
from a play, too unreal to affect his life.</p>

<p>Everts nodded to the man holding the helmet. Doc
dropped his bracky weed and felt the helmet snap
down. A hiss of oxygen reached him and the suit ballooned
out. There was no gravity; the two men handed
him up easily to the one in the airlock while the inner
seal began to close.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>There was still ten seconds to go, according to the
big chronometer that had been installed in the lock. The
spaceman used it in tying the sack of possessions firmly
to Doc's suit.</p>

<p>A red light went on. The man caught Doc and held
him against the outer seal. The red light blinked. Four
seconds ... three ... two....</p>

<p>There was a sudden heavy thudding sound, and the
<i>Iroquois</i> seemed to jerk sideways slightly. The spaceman's
face swung around in surprise.</p>

<p>The red light blinked and stayed on. Zero!</p>

<p>The outer seal snapped open and the spaceman
heaved. Air exploded outwards, and Doc went
with it. He was alone in space, gliding away from the
ship, with oxygen hissing softly through the valve and
ticking away his life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<h3>Convert</h3>


<p>Feldman fought for control of himself, forced himself
to think, to hold onto his sanity. It was sheer stupidity,
since nothing could have been more merciful than
to lose this reality. But the will to be himself was
stronger than logic. And bit by bit, he forced the fear
and horror away from him until he could examine his
situation.</p>

<p>He was spinning slowly, so that stars ahead of him
seemed to crawl across his view. The ship was retreating
from him already hundreds of yards away. Mars
was a shrunken pill far away.</p>

<p>Then something blinked to one side. He turned his
head to stare.</p>

<p>A little ship was less than three hundred yards away.
He recognized it as a life raft. Now his spin brought
him around to face it, and he saw it was parallelling
his course. The ejection of the life raft must have
caused the thump he'd heard before he was cast adrift.</p>

<p>It meant someone was trying to save him. It meant
<i>life</i>!</p>

<p>He flailed his arms and beat his legs together, senselessly
trying to force himself closer, while trying to
guess who could have taken the chance. No one he
could think of could have booked passage on the <i>Iroquois</i>.
There wasn't that much free money in the villages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Something flashed a hot blue, and the little ship leaped
forward. Whoever was handling it knew nothing about
piloting. It picked up too much speed at too great an
angle.</p>

<p>Again blue spurts came, but this time matters were
even worse. Then there was a long wait before a third
try was made. He estimated the course. It would miss
him by a good hundred feet, but it was probably the best
the amateur pilot could do. The ship drifted closer, but
to one side. It would soon pass him completely.</p>

<p>A spacesuited figure suddenly appeared in the tiny
airlock, holding a coil of rope. The rope shot out, well
thrown. But it was too short. It would pass within ten
feet&mdash;and might as well have been ten miles for all the
good it would do him.</p>

<p>Every film he had seen on space seemed to form a
mad jumble in his mind, but he seized on the first idea
he could remember. He inhaled deeply and yanked the
oxygen tank free. An automatic seal on the suit cut off
the connection. He aimed the hissing bottle, fumbling
for the manual valve.</p>

<p>It almost worked. It kicked him toward the rope
slightly, but most of the energy was wasted in setting
him into a wilder spin. He blinked, trying to spot the
rope. It was within five feet now.</p>

<p>Again he waited, until he seemed to be in position.
This time he threw the bottle away from it. It added
spin to his vertical axis, but the rope came into view
within arm's reach.</p>

<p>He grasped it, just as his lungs seemed about to burst.
He couldn't hold on long enough to tie the rope....</p>

<p>His lungs gave up suddenly, collapsing and then sucking
in greedily. Clean air rushed in, letting his head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
clear. He'd forgotten that the inflated suit held enough
oxygen for several minutes.</p>

<p>His body struck the edge of the airlock and a hand
jerked him inside. The outer seal was slammed shut and
locked, and there was a hiss of air entering.</p>

<p>He threw back his helmet just as Chris Ryan jerked
hers off.</p>

<p>Her voice shook almost hysterically. "Thank God.
Dan, I almost gave up!"</p>

<p>"I liked the air out there better," he told her bitterly.
"If you'll open the lock again, I'll leave. Or am I supposed
to believe this is rescue and that you came along
just to save me?"</p>

<p>"I came along to see you killed, as you know very
well. Saving you wasn't in my orders."</p>

<p>He grunted and reached for the handle that would
release the outer lock. "Better get back inside if you
don't want to blow out with me."</p>

<p>"It's up to you, Dan," she told him, and there was
all the sincerity in the world in her blue eyes. "I'm on
your side now."</p>

<p>He began counting on his fingers. "Let's see. The
spare battery, the delay in arresting me, the choice of
Matthews&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was all true." Anger began to grow in her eyes.
"Dan Feldman, you get inside this raft! If you don't
care about me, you might consider the people dying of
the plague who need you!"</p>

<p>She'd played her trump, and it took the round. He
followed her.</p>

<p>"All right," he said grudgingly. "Spill your story."</p>

<p>She held out a copy of a space radiogram, addressed
to Mrs. D. E. Everts, and signed by one of the best
doctors on the Lobby Board of Directors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Regret confirm diagnosis. Topsecret. Repeat
topsecret. Martian fever incubates fourteen years,
believed highly fatal. No cure, research beginning
immediately. Penalty violation topsecret, death all
concerned.</p></div>

<p>"Mrs. Everts rates a topsecret break?" Doc commented
dryly. "Come off it, Chris!"</p>

<p>"She's the daughter of Elmers of Space Lobby!"
Chris answered. She pointed to the message, underlining
words with her finger. "<i>Fourteen years.</i> You
couldn't have caused it. <i>Highly fatal.</i> And people are
being told it's only a skin disease. <i>Research beginning.</i>
But you've already done most of the research. I can
see that now. I can see a lot of things."</p>

<p>"You've got me beat then," he said. "I can't see how
such a reformed young noblewoman calmly walked
over and stole a life raft. I can't see how your brilliant
mind concocted this whole scheme in almost no time.
And to be honest, I can't even see why Medical Lobby
decided to save me at the last minute and sent you to
do the job. You didn't have to spy out knowledge from
me. I've been trying all along to get it to your Research
division."</p>

<p>She sighed and dropped onto a little seat.</p>

<p>"I can't prove my motives. You'll just have to believe
me. But it wasn't hard to do what I've done. That shuttle
pilot was found in a routine check, stowed away on
the life raft. I was with Captain Everts when he was
found, so I discovered how to get into the raft. And I
heard his whole confession. He wasn't the real pilot.
He'd come from the villages to save you. The whole
scheme was his. I just used it, hoping I could reach
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>As always her story had a convincing element she
shouldn't have known. The pilot's farewell, addressing
him as Dr. Feldman, had been too low for her to hear,
but it was something that fitted her story. It was probably
a deliberate clue to give him hope, to assure him
the villages were still trying. It shook his confidence.</p>

<p>"And your motive&mdash;your real motive?" he insisted.</p>

<p>She swore at him, then began ripping off the spacesuit.
She turned her back, pulling a thin blouse down
from her neck. He stared, then reached out to touch
the lump there.</p>

<p>"So you've had Selznik's migraine and know you're
carrying plague. And you've decided your precious
Lobby won't save you?"</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes, then raised them to meet his
defiantly. "I'm not just scared and selfish. Dad caught
it, too, and it must be close to the time for him. He
switched to Mars-normal when he was a liaison agent
and never changed back. Dan, are we all going to have
to die? Can't you save him?"</p>

<p>Feldman was out of his suit and at the control panel.
There was a manual lever, which Chris must have used
before. It might work out here where there was room
to maneuver and nothing to hit. But trying to make a
landing was going to be different.</p>

<p>"Dan?" she repeated.</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I don't know. They've started research
too late and they'll be under so much pressure
that the real brains won't have a chance. The topsecret
stuff looks bad for research. Maybe there's a cure. It
works in culture bottles, but it may fail in person. When
I'm convinced I'm safe with you, I may tell you about
it."</p>

<p>"Oh." Her voice was low. Then she sighed. "I sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>pose
I can understand why you hate me, Dan."</p>

<p>"I don't hate you. I'm too mixed up. Tomorrow
maybe, but not now. Shut up and let me see if I can
figure out how to land this thing."</p>

<p>He found that the fuel tanks were nearly full, but
that still didn't leave much margin. Mars must have been
notified by Everts and be ready to pick the raft up. He
had to reach the wastelands away from any of the shuttle
ports. They had no aspirators, however, and they
couldn't cover much territory in the spacesuits they
would have to use. It meant he'd have to land close to
a village where he was known.</p>

<p>He jockeyed the ship around by trial and error,
studying the manual that was lying prominently on the
control panel. According to the booklet, the ship was
simple to operate. It was self-leveling in an atmosphere,
and automatic flare computers were supposed to make
it possible for an amateur to judge the rate of descent
near the surface. It looked reassuring&mdash;and was probably
written with that in mind.</p>

<p>Finally he reached for the control, hoping he'd figured
his landing orbit reasonably well by simple logic.
He smoothed it out in the following hours as he
watched the markings on Mars. When they were near
turnover point, he began cranking the little gyroscope
to swing the ship. It saved fuel to turn without power,
and he wasn't sure he could have turned accurately by
blasting.</p>

<p>He was gaining some proficiency, however, he felt.
But now he had to waste fuel and ruin his orbit again.
There was no way to practice maneuvering without actually
doing so.</p>

<p>In the end, he compromised, leaving a small margin
for a bad landing that would require a second attempt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
but with less practice than he wanted.</p>

<p>He had located Jake's village through the little telescope
when he finally reached for the main blast control.
The thin haze of Mars' atmosphere came rushing
up, while the blast lashed out. Then they were in the
outer fringes of the sky and the blast was beginning to
show a corona that ruined visibility.</p>

<p>He turned to the flare computer and back to what
he could see through the quartz viewport. He was going
to land about half a mile from the village, as nearly
as he could judge.</p>

<p>The computer seemed to work as it should. The
speed was within acceptable limits. He gave up trying
to see the ground and was forced to trust the machinery
designed for amateur pilots. The flare bloomed, and
he yanked down on the little lever.</p>

<p>It could have been worse. They hit the ground,
bounced twice, and turned over. The ship was a mess
when Feldman freed himself from the elastic straps of
the seat. Chris had shrieked as they hit, but she was unbuckling
herself now.</p>

<p>He threw her her spacesuit and one of the emergency
bottles of oxygen from the rack. "Hurry up with
that. We've sprung a leak and the pressure's dropping."</p>

<p>They were halfway to the village when a dozen tractors
came racing up and Jake piled out of the lead one
to drag the two in with him.</p>

<p>"Heard about it from the broadcasts and figured you
might land around here. Good to see you, Doc." He
started the tractor off at full speed, back to the wastelands,
while Doc stared at the armed men who were
riding the tractors.</p>

<p>Jake caught his look and nodded. "You're in enemy
territory, Doc. There's a war going on!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<h3>War</h3>


<p>Sometimes it seemed to Doc that war was nothing
but an endurance race to see how many times they
could run before they were bombed. He was just beginning
to drop off to sleep after a long trip for the
sixth consecutive day when the little alarm shrilled. He
sighed and shook Chris awake.</p>

<p>"Again?" she protested. But she got up and began
helping him pack.</p>

<p>Jake came in, his eyes weary, pulling on the old
jacket with the big star on its sleeve. Doc hadn't been
too surprised to learn that Jake was the actual leader of
the rebels. "Shuttles spotted taking off this way. And I
still can't find where the leak is. They haven't missed
our location once this week. Here, give me that."</p>

<p>He took the electron mike that had been among Doc's'
possessions, but Chris recaptured it. "I can manage,"
she told him, and headed out for the tractor where Lou
was waiting.</p>

<p>Doc scowled after her. He and Jake had been watching
her. She was too useful to Doc's research to be
turned away, but they didn't trust her yet. So far, however,
they had found nothing wrong with her conduct.
Still....</p>

<p>He swung suddenly into Jake's tractor. "Just remembered
something. How'd they find me that time I
stopped in the tractor to use the mike? I was pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
well hidden, and no tracks last in the sand long enough
for them to have followed. But they were there when
I came to. Somehow, they must have put a radio tracer
on me."</p>

<p>Jake waited while they lighted up, his eyes suddenly
bright. "You mean something you got from her house
was bugged? It figures."</p>

<p>"And I've still got all the stuff. Now they find wherever
we set up headquarters, though they've always
managed to miss my laboratory, even when they've hit
the troops around us. Jake, I think it's the microscope."
Doc managed to push enough junk off one of the seats
to make a cramped bed, and stretched out. "Sure, we
figured they sent her because they want to keep tabs
on what I discover. They've finally gotten scared of the
plague, and she's the perfect Judas goat. But they have
to have some way to get in touch with her. I'll bet
there's a tracer in the mike and a switch so she can
modulate it or key it to send out Morse."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jake nodded. "Well, she does her own dirty
work. I might get to like her if she was on our side.
Okay, Doc. If they've put things into the mike, I've got
a boy who'll find and fix it so she won't guess it's been
touched."</p>

<p>Doc relaxed. For the moment, there would be no
power in the instrument, nor any excuse for her to use
it. But she must have handled some secret arrangement
during the work periods. She used the mike more than
he did. The switch could be camouflaged easily enough.
If anyone detected the signal, they'd probably only
think it was some leak in the electrical circuit.</p>

<p>Far away, the shuttle rockets had appeared as tiny
dots in the sky. They were standing on their tails a second
later, just off the ground, letting the full force of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
their blasts bake the area where headquarters had been.</p>

<p>Jake watched grimly, driving by something close to
instinct. Then he looked back. "Know anything about
a Dr. Harkness?"</p>

<p>"Not much, except that he protested sealing off the
villages. Why?"</p>

<p>"He and five other doctors were picked up, trying to
get through to us. Claimed they wanted to give us medical
help. We can use them, God knows. I guess I'll
have to chance it."</p>

<p>They stopped at a halfway village and hid the tractors
before looking for a place to rest. Doc found Chris
curled up asleep against the microscope. He had a hard
time getting her to leave it in the tractor, but she was
too genuinely tired to put up any real argument.</p>

<p>Jake reported in the morning before they set out
again. "You were right, Doc. It was a nice job of work.
Must have taken the best guys in Southport to hide the
circuit so well. But it's safe now. It just makes a kind
of meaningless static nobody can trace. Maybe we can
get you a permanent lab now."</p>

<p>Doc debated again having Chris left behind and decided
against it. The Lobby was determined to let him
find a cure for them if he could. That meant Chris
would work herself to exhaustion trying to help. Let
her think she was doing it for the Lobby! It was time
she was on the receiving end of a double cross.</p>

<p>"It's a stinking way to run a war," he decided.</p>

<p>Jake chuckled without much humor. "It's the war
you wanted, remember? They forced our hand, but it
had to come sometime. Right now the Lobby's fighting
to get their hands on your work before we can use it;
they're just using holding tactics, which helps our side.
And we're hoping you get the cure so we can win.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
With that, maybe we'll whip them."</p>

<p>It was a crazy war, with each side killing more of its
own men than of the enemy. The runners were increasing,
and Jake's army was learning to shoot the poor
devils mercifully and go on. They knew, at least, that
there was no current danger of infection. In the Lobby
towns, more were dying of panic in their efforts to escape
the runners.</p>

<p>Desert towns had joined the villages, reluctantly but
inevitably, to give the rebels nearly three-quarters of
the total population. But the Lobby forces and the few
cities held most of the real fighting equipment and they
were ready to wait until Earth could send out unmanned
rockets, loaded with atomics, which could cut
through space at ten times normal speed.</p>

<p>There were vague lines of battle, but time was the
vital factor. The Lobbies waited to steal a cure for the
plague and the villages waited until they could announce
it and demand surrender as its price.</p>

<p>It looked as if both sides were doomed to disappointment,
however. He and Chris had put in every spare
minute between moving and the minimum of sleep in
searching for something that would check the disease.
It couldn't grow in an Earth-normal body, but it didn't
die, either. And there wasn't enough normal food available
to permit the switch-over for more than a handful
of people. Even Earth was out of luck, since eighty percent
of her population ate synthetics. There were ways
to synthesize Earth-normal food, but they were still
hopelessly inefficient.</p>

<p>Jake had ordered one of the villages to rebuild their
plant for such a purpose, while another was producing
the enzyme that would permit switching. But it looked
hopeless for more than a few of the most valuable men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"No progress?" Jake asked for the hundredth time.</p>

<p>Doc grinned wryly. "A lot, but no help. We've found
a fine accelerator for the bug. We can speed up its incubation
or even make someone already infected catch
it all over again. But we can't slow it down or stop it."</p>

<p>The new laboratory was still being fitted when they
arrived. It had been dug into one of the few real cliffs
in this section of Mars. The power plant had been installed,
complete with a steam plant that would operate
off sunlight in the daytime through a series of heat
valves that took in a lot of warm air and produced
smaller amounts hot enough to boil water.</p>

<p>"I'll see you whenever I can," Jake said. "But mostly,
you're going to be somewhat isolated so they won't
trace you. Let them think they goofed with the shuttles
and hit you and Chris. Anything you need?"</p>

<p>"Guinea pigs," Doc told him sarcastically. It was
meant as a joke, though a highly bitter one. Jake
nodded and left them.</p>

<p>Doc opened the cots as Chris came in, not bothering
to unpack the equipment. "Hit the sack, Chris," he told
her.</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully. "You almost said that
the way you'd address a human being, Dan. You're
slipping. One of these days you'll like me again."</p>

<p>"Maybe." He was too tired to argue. "I doubt it,
though. Forget it and get some sleep."</p>

<p>She watched him silently until he got up to turn out
the light. Then she sighed heavily. "Dan?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"I never got a divorce. The publicity would have
been bad. But anyway, we're still married."</p>

<p>"That's nice." He swung to face her briefly. "And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
they found the radio in the microscope. Better get to
sleep, Chris."</p>

<p>"Oh." It was a quiet exclamation, barely audible.
There was a sound that might have been a sniffle if it
had come from anyone else. Then she rolled over. "All
right, Dan. I still want to help you."</p>

<p>He cursed himself for a stupid fool for telling her.
Fatigue was ruining what judgment he had. From now
on, he'd have to watch her every minute. Or had she
really seen the value of the research by now? She
wasn't a fool. It should have registered on even her
stubborn mind. But he was too sleepy to think about it.</p>

<p>She had breakfast ready in the morning. She made
no comment on what had been said during the night.
Instead, she began discussing a way to keep one of the
organic antibiotics from splitting into simpler compounds
when they tried to switch it over to Mars-normal.
They were both hopelessly bad chemists and biologists,
but there was no one else to do the work.</p>

<p>Chris worked harder than ever during the day.</p>

<p>Just after sundown, Jake came in with a heavy box.
He dropped it onto the floor. "Mice!"</p>

<p>Doc ripped off the cover, exposing fine screening.
There were at least six dozen mice inside!</p>

<p>"Harkness found them," Jake explained. "A hormone
extraction plant used them for testing some of the products.
Had them sent by regular shipments from Earth.
Getting them cost a couple of men, but Harkness claims
it's worth it. He's a good man on a raid. Here!"</p>

<p>He'd gone to the doorway again and came back with
another box, this one crammed with bottles and boxes.
"They had quite a laboratory, and Harkness picked out
whatever he thought you could use."</p>

<p>Chris and Doc were going through it. The labels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
were engineering ones, but the chemical formulae were
identification enough. There were dozens of chemicals
they hadn't hoped to get.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" Doc finally asked as they began
arranging the supplies.</p>

<p>"More runners. A lot more. We're still holding things
down, but it's reaching a limit. Panic will start in the
camps if this keeps on. But that's my worry. You stick
to yours."</p>

<p>Several of the new chemicals showed promise in the
tubes. But two of them proved fatal to the mice and
the others were completely innocuous in the little animal's
bodies, both to mouse and to germ. The plague
was much hardier in contact with living cells than in
the artificial environment of the culture jars.</p>

<p>They lost seven mice in two days, but that seemed
unimportant; the females were already living up to their
reputations, nearly all pregnant. Doc didn't know the
gestation period, but he remembered that it was short.</p>

<p>"Funny they all started at the same time," he commented.
"Must have been shipped out separately or
else been kept apart while they were switched over to
Mars-normal. Something interrupted their habits, anyhow."</p>

<p>A few nights later they learned what it was. There
was a horrible squealing that woke him out of the
depths of his sleep. Chris was already at the light
switch. As light came on, they turned to the mouse
box.</p>

<p>All the animals were charging about in their limited
space, their little legs driving madly and their mouths
open. What they lacked in size they made up in numbers,
and the din was terrific.</p>

<p>But it didn't last. One by one, the mice began drop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ping
to the floor of the cage. In fifteen minutes, they
were all dead!</p>

<p>It was obviously the plague, contracted after having
their metabolism switched. Women were sterile for
some time after Selznik's migraine struck, and the same
must have been true of the mice. They must have contracted
the plague at about the same time and reached
fertility together. Somehow, the plague incubation period
had been shortened to fit their life span; the disease
was nothing if not adaptive.</p>

<p>Chris prepared a slide in dull silence. The familiar
cell was there when Doc looked through the microscope.
He picked up one of the little creatures and cut
it open, removing one of the foetuses.</p>

<p>"Make a film of that," he suggested.</p>

<p>She worked rapidly, scraping out the almost microscopic
brain, dissolving out the fatty substance, and
transferring the result to a film. This time, even at full
magnification, there was no sign of the filaments that
were always present in diseased flesh. The results were
the same for the other samples they made.</p>

<p>"Something about the very young animal or a secretion
from the mother's organs keeps the bug from
working." Doc reached for a bracky weed and accepted
a light from Chris without thinking of it. "Every kid
I've heard about contracted the plague between the second
and third year. None are born with it, none get it
earlier. I've suspected this, but now here's confirmation."</p>

<p>Chris began preparing specimens, while Doc got
busy with tubes of the culture. They'd have to test
various fluids from the tiny bodies, but there were
enough cultures prepared. Then, if the substance only
inhibited growth, there would be a long, slow test; if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
it killed the bugs, they might know more quickly.</p>

<p>Jake came in before the final tests, but waited on
them. Doc was studying a film in the microscope. He
suddenly motioned excitedly for Chris.</p>

<p>"See the filaments? They're completely disintegrated.
And there's one of the big cells broken open. We've
got it! It's in the blood of the foetus. And it must be
in the blood of newborn children, too!"</p>

<p>Jake looked at the slide, but his face was doubtful.</p>

<p>"Maybe you've got something, Doc. I hope so. And
I hope you can use it." He shook his head wearily.
"We need good news right now. A couple of big rockets
just reached the station and they've been sending
shuttles back and forth a mile a minute. Nobody can
figure how they got here so fast or what they're for.
But it doesn't look good for us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>Susceptibility</h3>


<p>Doc could feel the tension in the village where GHQ
was temporarily located long before they were close
enough for details to register. The people were gathered
in clusters, staring at the sky where the station
must be. A few were pacing up and down, gesticulating
with tight sweeps of their arms.</p>

<p>One woman suddenly went into even more violent
action. She leaped into the air and then took off at a
rapid trot, then a run. Her hands were tearing at her
clothes and her mouth seemed to be working violently.
She was halfway to the top of the nearest dune before
a rifle cracked. She dropped, to twitch once and lie
still.</p>

<p>Almost with her death, another figure leaped from
one of the houses, his face bare of the necessary aspirator.
He took off at a violent run, but he was falling
from lack of air before the bullet ended his struggles.</p>

<p>The people suddenly began to move apart, as if trying
to get away from each other. For weeks they had
faced the horror with courage; now it was finally too
much for them.</p>

<p>Tension mounted as no news came from the cities.
Doc noticed that it seemed to aggravate or speed up
the disease. He saw three men shot in the next half-hour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>He was trying to calm them with word of a possible
cure for the plague, but their reactions were as curiously
dull as those of Jake had been. As he spoke, they
faced him with set expressions. At his mention of the
need for the blood of young children, they turned from
him, sullenly silent.</p>

<p>Jake came over, nodding unhappily. "It's what I was
afraid might happen, Doc. George Lynn! Tell Doc
what's wrong."</p>

<p>Lynn was reluctant, but he finally stumbled out his
explanation. "It ain't like you, Doc. Comes from that
Lobby woman you got. It's her dirty idea. We've seen
the Lobby doctors cutting open our kids, poisoning
their blood, and bleeding them dry. That ain't gonna
happen again, Doc. You tell her it ain't!"</p>

<p>Doc swore as he realized their ignorance. An unexplained
vaccination looked like poisoning of the blood.
But he couldn't understand the bleeding part until Jake
filled him in.</p>

<p>"Northport infant's wing. Each department has its
own blood bank and donation is compulsory. Southport
started it a couple months ago, too."</p>

<p>The long arm of the Lobby had reached out again.
Now if he ever got them to try the treatment, it would
be only after long sessions of preparing them with the
facts, and there was hardly enough time for the crucial
work!</p>

<p>By afternoon, Judge Ben Wilson reached them. His
voice shook with fatigue as he climbed up to address
the crowd through a power megaphone. "Southport's
going crazy." He had to pause for breath between each
sentence. "Earth's pulling back all the important people.
They're packing them into the ships. They're leaving
only colonials with no Earth rights. Those ships left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
when they decided the plague was coming from here.
They won't let anybody back until the plague is licked.
There won't be an Earth technician on Mars tomorrow."</p>

<p>"No bombs?" someone called.</p>

<p>"No bombs. The ships must have started before you
rebelled, maybe meant honestly to save their own kind.
But now it's a military action, and don't think it won't
mean trouble. The poor devils in the city bet on the
wrong horse. Now they can't run their food factories
or anything else for long. Not without technicians.
They've got to whip you now. Up to this time, they've
been fighting for the Lobbies. Now they'll fight you
for their own bellies to get your supplies. And they've
still got shuttle rockets and fuel for them. Now beat it.
I gotta confer with Jake."</p>

<p>Doc started after the judge, but Dr. Harkness caught
his arm and drew him aside. Chris followed.</p>

<p>"I've found another epidemic," Harkness told them.
"Over at Marconi. It's kept me on the run all night,
and now half the village is down with it. Starts like a
common cold, runs a fair fever, and the skin breaks out
all over with bright red dots...."</p>

<p>He went on describing it. Chris began asking him
about what medical supplies he had brought with him,
pilfered from Northport hospital. She seemed to know
what it was, but refused to say until she saw the cases.
Doc also preferred to wait. Sometimes things weren't
as bad as they seemed, though usually they were worse.</p>

<p>Marconi was dead to all outward appearances, with
nobody on the streets. It had been a village of great
hopes a week before, since this was where they had
decided to experiment with switching the people back
to Earth-normal. They'd had the best chance of sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>vival
of anyone on Mars until this came up.</p>

<p>Three people lay on the beds in the first house Harkness
led them to. The room was darkened, and a man
was stumbling around, trying to tend the others, though
the little spots showed on his skin. He grinned weakly.
"Hi, Doc. I guess we're making a lot of trouble, ain't
we?"</p>

<p>Chris gave Doc no chance to answer. "Just as I
thought. Measles! Plain old-fashioned measles."</p>

<p>"Figured so," the sick man said. "Like my brother
back on Earth."</p>

<p>The others looked doubtful, but Doc reassured them.
Chris should know; she'd worked in a swanky hospital
where the patients were mostly Earth-normal. Measles
was one of the diseases which was foiled by the metabolism
switch. Well, at least they wouldn't have to be
quarantined here.</p>

<p>Chris finished treating the family with impersonal efficiency,
discussing the symptoms loudly with Harkness.
"It's a good thing it isn't serious!"</p>

<p>"No," Harkness answered bitterly. "Not serious. It's
only killed five children and three adults so far!"</p>

<p>"It would, here," Doc agreed unhappily. He led Chris
out of the room on the pretext of washing his hands.
"It's serious enough to force us to abandon the whole
idea of going back to Earth-normal. Measles today,
smallpox, tuberculosis, scarlet fever and everything else
tomorrow. These people have lived Mars-normal so long
their natural immunity has been destroyed. On Earth
where the disease was everywhere, kids used to pick
up some immunity with constant exposure, even without
what might be called a case of the disease. Here,
the blood has no reason to build antibodies. They can
be killed by things people used to laugh at. How the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
disease got here, I don't know. But it's here. So we'll
have to give up the idea of switching back to Earth-normal."</p>

<p>He gathered up one of the kits and started toward
the other houses. "And Lord knows how long it will
take to get the blood for the other treatment, even if
it works."</p>

<p>They worked as a team for a while, with Harkness
frowning as he watched Chris. Finally the young doctor
stopped Chris outside the fifth house. "These are
my patients, Dr. Ryan. I left the Lobby because I didn't
believe colonials were mere livestock. I still feel the
same. I appreciate your help in diagnosis and methods
of treatment. But I can't let you handle my patients
this way."</p>

<p>"Dan!" She swung around with eyes glazing. "Dan,
are you going to stand for that?"</p>

<p>"I think you'd better wait in the tractor, Chris."</p>

<p>He was lucky enough to catch the kit she threw at
him before its precious contents spilled. But it wasn't
luck that guided his hand to the back of her skirt hard
enough to leave it stinging.</p>

<p>Her face froze and she stormed out. A moment later
they heard the tractor start off.</p>

<p>But Doc had no time to think of her. He and Harkness
split up and began covering the streets, house by
house, while he passed on the word to abandon the metabolism
switch and go back to Mars-normal.</p>

<p>Jake sent two other doctors to relieve them late in
the evening. Things were somewhat quieter at GHQ
as Doc reported the events at Marconi.</p>

<p>"Where's Dr. Ryan?" Jake asked at last.</p>

<p>Doc exchanged glances with Harkness. "She isn't in
the lab?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wasn't there an hour ago."</p>

<p>Doc cursed himself for letting her go. With the
knowledge that the radio in the mike was disabled,
she'd obviously grabbed the first chance to report back.
And with her had gone news of the only cure they
had found.</p>

<p>Jake took it as philosophically as he could, though it
was a heavy blow to his hopes. They spent half the
night looking for her tractor, on the chance that she
might have gotten lost or broken down, but there was
no sign of it.</p>

<p>She was waiting in the laboratory when he returned
at dawn. Her face was dirty and her uniform was a
mess. But she was smiling. She got up to greet him,
holding out two large bottles.</p>

<p>"Infant plasma&mdash;straight from Southport. And if you
think I had it easy lying my way in and out of the
hospital, you're a fool, Dan Feldman. If the man who
took my place there hadn't been a native idiot, I never
would have gotten away with it."</p>

<p>The things he had suspected could still be right, he
realized. She could have reported everything to the
Lobby. It was a better explanation than her vague account
of bullying her way in and out. But she'd had a
rough drive, and he wanted the plasma. Curiously, he
was glad to have her back with him. He reached out a
hand for the bottles.</p>

<p>She put the bottle on the table and grabbed up a
short-bladed knife. "Not so fast," she cried. Her eyes
were blazing now. "Dan Feldman, if you touch those
bottles until you've crawled across the floor on your
face and apologized for the way you treated me the last
few days, I'll cut your damned heart out."</p>

<p>He shook his head, chuckling at the picture she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
made. There were times when he could almost see why
he'd married her.</p>

<p>"All right, Chris," he gave in. "I'll be darned if I'll
crawl, but you've earned an apology. Okay?"</p>

<p>She sighed uncertainly. Then she nodded and began
changing for work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<h3>Immunity</h3>


<p>They worked through the day in what seemed to be
armed truce. There was no coffee waiting for him when
he awoke next, as he'd come to expect, but he didn't
comment. He went to where she was already working,
checking on the results of the plasma on the cultures.</p>

<p>The response had been slower than with the mouse
blood, but now the bugs seemed to be dead. The filaments
were destroyed, and there were no signs of the
big cells. It seemed to be a cure, at least in the culture
bottles.</p>

<p>"We'll need volunteers," he decided. "There should
be animals, but we don't have any. At least this stuff
isn't toxic. We need a natural immune and someone infected.
Two of each, so one can be treated and the
other used for a control. Makes four. Not enough to
be sure, but it will have to do."</p>

<p>"Two," Chris corrected. "You're not infected, I am."</p>

<p>"Two others," he agreed. "I'll get them from Jake."</p>

<p>Most of GHQ was out on the street, but Doc found
Jake inside the big schoolroom where he enjoyed his
early morning bracky and coffee. The chief listened
and agreed at once, turning to the others in the room.</p>

<p>"Who's had the jumping headache? Okay, Swanee.
Who never had it?" He blinked in surprise as three men
nodded out of the eight present. "I guess you go, Tom."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men stood up, tamping out their weeds, and
went out with Doc.</p>

<p>Chris had everything set up. They matched coins to
decide who would be treated. Doc noticed that Chris
would get no plasma, while he was scheduled for everything.
He watched her prepare the culture and add the
accelerator that would speed development and make
certain he and Tom were infected, then let her inject it.</p>

<p>That was all, except for the waiting. To keep conditions
more closely alike, they were to stay there until
the tests were finished, not even eating for fear of upsetting
the conditions. Swanee dug out a pack of worn
cards and began to deal while Doc dug out some large
pills to use as chips.</p>

<p>It was an hour later when the pain began. Doc had
just won the pot of fifty pills and opened his mouth
for the expected gloating. He yelled as an explosion
seemed to go off inside his head. Even closing his
mouth was agony.</p>

<p>A moment later, Tom began to sweat. It got worse,
spreading to the whole area of the back of the head
and neck. Doc lay on the cot, envying Chris and Swanee
who had already been infected naturally. He longed
desperately for bracky, and had to keep reminding himself
that no drugs must upset the tests. It was the longest
day he had ever spent, and he began to doubt that
he could get through it. He watched the little clock
move from one minute to nine over to half a minute
and hung breathless until it hit the nine. There was
no question about whether the infection had taken.
Now they could dull the agony.</p>

<p>Chris had the anodyne tablets already dissolved in
water, and Swanee was passing out three lighted bracky
weeds. It took a few minutes for the relief of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
anodyne, and even that couldn't kill all the pain. But
it didn't matter by comparison. He sucked the weed,
mashed it out and began dealing the cards again.</p>

<p>They had a plentiful supply of the anodyne and used
it liberally during the night. The test was a speeded-up
simulation of the natural course of the disease, where
painkiller would take time to get for most people here,
but would then be used generously.</p>

<p>Precisely at nine in the morning, Chris began to inject
Swanee and Doc with plasma.</p>

<p>Now there was no thought of cards. They waited,
trying to talk, but with most of their attention on the
clock. Doc had estimated that an hour should be enough
to show results, but it was hard to remember that an
hour was the guess as to the minimum time.</p>

<p>He winced as Chris took a tiny bit of flesh from his
neck. She went to the other men, and then submitted
to his work on herself. Then she began preparing the
slides.</p>

<p>"Feldman," she read the name of the slide as she inserted
it into the microscope. Then her breath caught
sharply. "Only dead cells!"</p>

<p>It was the same for Swanee and Tom. Each had to
look at his own slide and have it explained before the
results could be believed. But at last Chris bent over
her own slide. A minute later she glanced up, nodding.
"What it should be. It checks."</p>

<p>Tom whooped and went out the door to notify Jake.
There was only plasma for some two hundred injections,
but that should yield sufficient proof. Once salvation
was offered, there should be no trouble convincing
the people that blood donations from their children
were worthwhile.</p>

<p>Later, when the last of the plasma had been used,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
they could finally relax. Chris slipped off her smock
and dropped onto the cot. A tired smile came onto her
lips. "You're forgiven, Dan," she said. A moment later
she was obviously asleep. Doc meant to join her, but
it was too much effort. He leaned his head forward
onto his arms, vaguely wondering why she was calling
off the feud.</p>

<p>It was night outside when he awoke, and he was lying
on the cot, though he still felt cramped and
strained. He stirred, groaning, and finally realized that
a hand was on his shoulder shaking him. He looked up
to see Jake above him. Chris was busy with the coffee
maker.</p>

<p>Jake slumped onto the cot beside Doc. "We took
Southport," he announced.</p>

<p>That knocked the sleep out of Doc's system. "You
what?"</p>

<p>"We took it, lock, stock and barrel. I figured the
news of your cure would put guts into the men, and
it did. But we'd probably have taken it anyhow. There
wasn't anything to fight for there after Earth pulled out
and the plague really hit. Wilson mistook last-minute
panic for fighting spirit. The poor devils didn't have
anything to fight about, once the Lobby stopped goading
them."</p>

<p>Doc tried to assimilate the news. But once the surprise
was gone, he found it meant very little. Maybe
his revolutionary zeal had cooled, once the Lobby men
had pulled out. "We'll need a lot more plasma than
there is in Southport," he said.</p>

<p>"Not so much, maybe," Jake denied. "Doc, three of
the men you injected were shot down as runners. Your
plasma's no good."</p>

<p>"It takes time to work, Jake. I told you there might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
be a case or two that would be too close to the edge.
Three is more than I expected; but it's not impossible."</p>

<p>"There was plenty of time. They blew after we got
back from Southport." Jack dropped his hand on Doc's
shoulder, and his face softened. "Harkness tested every
man you injected. He finished half an hour ago. Five
showed dead bugs. The rest of them weren't helped
at all."</p>

<p>Doc fumbled for a weed, trying to think. But his
thoughts refused to focus. "Five!"</p>

<p>"Five out of two hundred. That's about average. And
what about Tom? He was jumping around after the
test last night, telling how you'd cured him, how he'd
seen the dead bugs; but he never had the jumping
headache, and you never gave him the plasma! He's got
dead bugs, though. Harkness tested him."</p>

<p>Doc let his realization of his own idiocy sink in until
he could believe it. Jake was right. Tom had never
been treated, yet Chris had reported dead bugs. They'd
all been so ready to believe in miracles that no one had
been able to think straight after the long wait.</p>

<p>"There was a bump on his neck&mdash;a small one," he
said slowly. "Jake, he must have caught it, even if he
seemed immune. If he was taking anodyne anyway for
something&mdash;or unconscious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was up in Northport six years ago for a kidney
operation," Jake admitted doubtfully. "We had to chip
in to pay for it. But you still didn't treat him, and he's
cured. Face it, Doc, that plasma is no good inside the
body."</p>

<p>His hand tightened on Doc's shoulder again. "We're
not blaming you. We don't judge a man here except by
what he is. Maybe the stuff helps a little. We'll go on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
using it when we get it; tell everybody you were a mite
optimistic, so they'll figure it's a gamble, but have a little
hope left. And you keep trying. Something cured
it in Tom. Now you find out what."</p>

<p>Doc watched him go out numbly, and turned to
Chris.</p>

<p>"It can't be right," she said shakily. "You and Swanee
were cured. Maybe it was the accelerator. It had to be
something."</p>

<p>"You didn't have the accelerator," he accused.</p>

<p>"No, and I've still got live bugs. I was never supposed
to be cured, so I expected to see just what I saw.
How I missed the fact that Tom should have been
like me, I don't know. Damn it, oh, damn it!"</p>

<p>He's never seen her cry before, except in fury. But
she mastered it almost at once, shaking tears out of her
eyes. "All right. Plasma works in a bottle but not in
an adult body. Maybe something works in the body
but not in a bottle."</p>

<p>"Maybe. And maybe some people are just naturally
immune after it reaches a certain stage. Maybe we ran
into coincidence."</p>

<p>But he didn't believe that, any more than she did.
The answer had to be in the room. He'd taken a massive
dose of the disease and been cured in a few hours.</p>

<p>Outside the room, the war went on, drawing toward
a close. The supposed partial cure was good propaganda,
if nothing else, and Jake was widening his territory
steadily. There was only token resistance against
him. He had the Southport shuttles now to cover huge
areas in a hurry. But inside the room, the battle was
less successful. It wasn't the accelerator. It wasn't the
tablets of anodyne. They even tried sweeping the floor
and using the dust without results.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Then another test in the room, made with four volunteers
Jake selected, yielded complete cures after injections
with plain salt water in place of plasma.</p>

<p>The plague speeded up again. About four people out
of a hundred now seemed to have caught the disease
and cured themselves. They accounted for what faith
was left in Doc's plasma and gave some unfounded hope
to the others.</p>

<p>Northport fell a week later, putting the whole planet
in rebel hands.</p>

<p>Jake returned, wearier than ever. He'd proved to be
one of the natural immunes, but the weight of the
campaign that could only end in a defeat by the plague
left him no room to rejoice in his personal fortune.</p>

<p>This time he looked completely defeated. And a moment
later, Doc saw why as Jake flipped a flimsy sheet
onto the table. It bore the seals of Space and Medical
Lobbies.</p>

<p>Jake pointed upwards. "The war rockets are there,
all right. We knew they'd come. Now all they want
for calling them off is our surrender and your cure.
If they don't get both, they'll blow the planet to bits.
We have two days."</p>

<p>The rockets could be seen clearly with binoculars.
There were more than enough to destroy all life on the
planet. Maybe they'd be used eventually, anyhow, since
the Lobbies wanted no more rebellion. But with a cure
for the plague, he might have bought them off.</p>

<p>Chris stood beside him, looking as if it were a bitter
pill for her, too. She'd risked herself in the hands of
the enemy, had cooperated with him in everything
she'd been taught to oppose, and had worked like a dog.
Now the Lobbies seemed to forget her as a useless tool.
They were falling back on a raw power play and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>getting
any earlier schemes.</p>

<p>"Maybe they'd hold off for a while if I agreed to go
to them and share all my ideas, specimens and notes,"
he said at last. "Do you think your Lobby would settle
for that, Chris?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Dan. I've stopped thinking their way."
She seemed almost apologetic for the admission.</p>

<p>He dropped an arm over her shoulder and turned
with her back to the laboratory. "Okay, then we've got
to find a miracle. We've got two days ahead of us. At
least we can try."</p>

<p>But he knew he was lying to himself. There wasn't
anything he could think of to try.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

<h3>Decision</h3>


<p>Two days was never enough time for a miracle. Doc
decided as he packed his notes into a small bag and
put it beside his bundle of personal belongings. He
glanced around the room for the last time, and managed
a grin at Jake's gloomy expression.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can bluff them, or maybe they'll string
along for a while," he said. "Anyhow, now that they've
agreed to take me and my notes in place of the cure
we're fresh out of, I've got to be on that shuttle when
it goes back to their men at orbital station."</p>

<p>Jake nodded. "I don't like selling friends down the
river, Doc. But it wouldn't do you any more good to
blow up with the planet, I reckon. They won't call off
the war rockets when they do get you, of course. But
maybe they won't use them, except as a threat to put
the Lobbies back in, stronger than ever."</p>

<p>He stuck out one of his awkwardly shaped hands,
clapped the aspirator over his face and hurried out.
Doc picked up his bags and went toward the little tractor
where Lou was waiting to drive him and Chris back
toward Southport and the shuttle rocket that would be
landing for them. They hadn't mentioned Chris in their
demands, but her father must expect her to return.</p>

<p>After they had him, he'd be on his own. His best
course was probably to insist on talking only to Ryan
at Medical Lobby, and then being completely honest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
The room here would be kept sealed, in case the Lobby
wanted to investigate where he had failed. And his notes
were honest, which was something that could usually
be determined. Chris could testify to that, anyhow,
since she'd kept a lot of them for him.</p>

<p>At best, there would be a chance for some compromise
and perhaps some clue for them that might eventually
end the plague. They had enough men to work
on it, and billions in equipment. At worst, he should
gain a little time.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Chris," he told her as he climbed through
the little airlock. "Maybe Harkness will turn up the
cure before our negotiations break down. He has the
whole of Northport Hospital to play with. They
haven't tried to chase him out of there yet. After all,
we almost found something with no equipment except
wild imaginations."</p>

<p>She shook her head as the tractor began moving.
"Shut up! I've got enough trouble without your coming
down with logorrhea. Don't be a fool."</p>

<p>"Why change now?" he asked her. "Everything I've
done has been because I am a fool. I guess my luck
lasted longer than I could expect. And I'm still fool
enough to think that the solution has to turn up eventually.
We know it has to be in that room. Damn it,
we must know it&mdash;if we could only think straight now."</p>

<p>She reached over and touched his hand, but made
no comment. They had been over that statement of
desperation too many times already. But it kept nagging
at him&mdash;something in the room, something in the
room! Something so common that nobody noticed it!</p>

<p>They passed a crowd chasing down a runner. Something
in that room could have saved the unlucky man.
It could have saved Mars, perhaps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>He growled for the hundredth time, cursing his fatigue-numbed
mind. Too little sleep, too much coffee
and bracky....</p>

<p>He reached for the package of weed, realizing that
he would miss it on Earth, if he ever got there. Like
everything here on the planet, he'd begun by detesting
it and wound up finding it the thing he wanted to
keep forever. He lighted the bracky and sat smoking,
watching Lou drive. When the first was finished, he
lighted another from the butt.</p>

<p>She put out a hand and took it away. "Please, Dan.
I can stand the stuff, but I'll never like it, and the tractor's
stuffy enough already. I've taken enough of it.
And it keeps reminding me of our test&mdash;the three of
you stinking up the place, puffing and blowing that
out, while I couldn't even get a breath of air...."</p>

<p>She was getting logorrhea herself now and&mdash;</p>

<p>The answer finally hit him! He jerked around, making
a grab for Lou's shoulder, motioning for the man
to head back.</p>

<p>"Bracky&mdash;it has to be! Chris, that's it. Jake picked
out the second group of men from his friends&mdash;and
they are all cronies because they hang around so much
in their so-called smoking room. The first time, it killed
the bugs for all of us who smoked&mdash;and it didn't work
for you because you never learned the habit."</p>

<p>Lou had the tractor turned and the rheostat all the
way to the floor.</p>

<p>She was sitting up now, but she wasn't fully satisfied.
"The percentage of immunes seems about right. But
why do some of the smokers get the disease while some
don't?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It depends on whether they pick up the
habit before or after the disease gets started. Tom must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
have got his while he was in Northport. They wouldn't
let him smoke there&mdash;if he had the habit before, for
that matter."</p>

<p>She found no fault with that. He twisted it back and
forth in his mind, trying to find a fault. There seemed
to be none. The only trouble was that they couldn't
send a message that bracky was the cure and hope that
Earth would prove it true. No polite note of apology
would do after that. They had to be sure. Too many
other ideas had proved wrong already.</p>

<p>Jake saw them coming and came running toward the
laboratory, but Lou stopped the tractor before it
reached the building and let the older man in.</p>

<p>"Get me a dozen men who have the plague. I want
the worst cases you have, and ones that Harkness tested
himself," Doc ordered. "And then start praying that
the cure we've got works fast."</p>

<p>Chris was at the electron mike at once, but one of
her hands reached out for the weed. She began puffing
valiantly, making sick faces. Now other men began
coming in, their faces struggling to find hope, but not
daring to believe yet. Jake followed them.</p>

<p>"We'll test at ten-minute intervals. That will be about
two hours for the last from the group," Doc decided.
One of the doctors Harkness had brought to the villages
was busy cutting tiny sections from the lumps on
the men's necks, while Chris ran them through the microscope
to make sure the bugs were still alive. The
regular optical mike was strong enough for that.</p>

<p>Doc handed each man a bracky weed, with instructions
to keep smoking, no matter how sick it made him.</p>

<p>There were no results at the end of ten minutes
when the first test was made. The second, at the end of
twenty minutes, was still infected with live bugs. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the half-hour, Chris frowned.</p>

<p>"I can't be sure&mdash;take a look, Dan."</p>

<p>He bent over, moving the slide to examine another
spot. "I think so. The next one should tell."</p>

<p>There was no doubt about the fourth test. The bugs
were dead, without a single exception that they could
find.</p>

<p>One by one, the men were tested and went storming
out, shouting the news. For a minute, the gathering
crowd was skeptical, remembering the other failures.
Then, abruptly, men were screaming, crying and fighting
for the precious bracky, like the legions of the
damned grabbing for lottery tickets when the prize was
a passport to paradise.</p>

<p>Jake swore as he moved toward the door. "We're low
on bracky here. Have to get a supply from Edison,
I guess, and cart it to the shuttle. Enough for a sample,
and to make them want more. It'll be tough, but
we'll get it there in time&mdash;by the time the shuttle should
be picking you up. Doc, you've won our war! From
now on, if Earth wants to keep her population up, we'll
be a free planet!"</p>

<p>Chris turned slowly from the microscope, holding a
slide in her hands. "My bugs," she said unbelievingly.
"Dan, they're dead!"</p>

<p>Jake patted her shoulder. "That makes it perfect,
girl. Now come on. We've got to start celebrating a
victory!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was the general feeling of most of the heads of the
villages when they met the next day in Southport, using
the courtroom that had been presided over so long by
Judge Ben Wilson. It was victory, and to the victor
belonged the spoils. The bracky had gone out to Earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
on a converted war rocket that could make the trip in
less than two weeks, and one packet had been specially
labeled for Captain Everts. But Earth had already confirmed
the cure. The small amounts of the herb found
in the botanical collections had been enough to satisfy
all doubts.</p>

<p>Harkness, Chris and Doc had been fighting against
the desire to rob Earth blind that filled most of the
men here for hours now. Now they had the backing
of Jake and Ben Wilson. And now finally they leaned
back, sensing that the argument had been won.</p>

<p>Bargaining was all right in its place, but it had no
place in affairs of life and death such as this. They
had to see that Earth received all the bracky she
needed. It was only right to charge a fair price for it,
but they couldn't restrict it by withholding or overcharging.
And they could still gain their ends without
blackmail.</p>

<p>Martian alkaloids were tricky things, and bracky
smoke contained a number of them. It would take Earth
at least ten years to discover and synthesize the right
one&mdash;and it would still probably cost more than it
would to import the weed from Mars. As long as the
source of that weed was here, and in the hands of the
colonials, there would be no danger of Earth's bombing
the planet.</p>

<p>Harkness got up to underscore a point Wilson had
made. "The plague lived a million years, and it won't
disappear now. The jumping headache, or <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'Selnick's'.">Selznick's</ins> migraine,
is unpleasant enough to make us reasonably sure
that there will be a steady consumption of the weed.
Our problem will be to keep the children from using
too much of it, probably." He pulled a weed out and
lighted it, puckering his face as the smoke bit his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
tongue. "I'm told that this gets to be an enjoyable habit.
If I can believe that, surely you can believe me when
I say we don't have to bargain with lives."</p>

<p>The village men were human, and most of them
could remember the strain they had been under when
they expected those they loved to die at any hour. It
had made them crave vengeance, but now as they had
a chance to reexamine it, they began to find it harder
to impose the horror of any such threat on others. The
final vote was almost unanimous.</p>

<p>Doc listened as they wrangled over the wording of
the message to Earth, feeling disconnected from it. He
passed Chris a bracky and lighted it for her. She took
it automatically, smiling as the smoke hit her lungs. It
was one thing they had in common now, at least.</p>

<p>Ben Wilson finally read the message.</p>

<p>"To the people of Earth, greetings!</p>

<p>"On behalf of the free people of Mars, I have the
honor to announce that this planet hereby declares itself
a sovereign and independent world. We shall continue
to regard Earth as our mother, and to consider
the health and welfare of her people in no way second
to our own in matters which affect both planets. We
trust that Earth will share this feeling of mutual friendship.
We trust that all strains of hostility will be ended.
The advantages to each from peaceful commerce make
any course other than the most cordial of relations unthinkable.</p>

<p>"We shall consider proof of such friendship an order
by Earth to all rockets circling this planet that they
shall deliver themselves safely into our hands, in order
that we may begin converting them to peaceful purposes
for the trade that is to come. In turn, we pledge
that all efforts will be made to ensure a prompt de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>livery
of those products most in demand, including the
curative bracky plant."</p>

<p>He turned to Doc then. "You want to sign it, Dr.
Feldman? Make it as acting president or something, until
we can get around to voting you into permanent
office."</p>

<p>"You and Jake fight over the job," Doc told him.
"No, Ben, I mean it."</p>

<p>He got up and moved out into the outer room, where
he could avoid the stares of amazement that were
turned to him. He'd never asked for the honor, and he
didn't want it.</p>

<p>Chris came with him. Her face was shocked and
something was slowly draining out of it as he looked
at her.</p>

<p>"Forget it, Chris," he said. "You're going back to
Earth. There is nothing for you here."</p>

<p>She hadn't quite given up. "There could be, Dan.
You know that."</p>

<p>"No. No, Chris, I don't think there ever can be. You
can't find a man strong enough to rule who'll be weak
enough to let you rule in his place. It didn't work on
Earth, and it won't work here. Forget the dreams you
had of what could be done with a new planet. Those
are the dreams that made a mess of the old one."</p>

<p>"I'll be back," she told him. "Some day I'll be back."</p>

<p>He shook his head again. "No. You wouldn't like
what you find here. Freedom is heady stuff, but you
have to have a taste for it. You can't acquire a fondness
for it secondhand. And for a while, there's going
to be freedom here. Besides, once you get back to
Earth, you'll forget what happened here."</p>

<p>She sighed at last. For the first time since he had
known her, she seemed to give in completely. And for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
that brief moment, he loved what she could have been,
but never would be.</p>

<p>"All right, Dan," she said quietly. "I can't fight you.
I never could, I see now. I'll take the rocket back.
What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>He hadn't bothered to think, but he knew the answer.
"Research. What else?"</p>

<p>There would be a lot of research done here. It had
been suppressed too long, and had piled up a back-pressure
that would have to be relieved. And from that
research, he suspected, would come the end of the stable
oligarchy of Earth. It could never stand against the
changes that would be pouring out of Mars.</p>

<p>She put her hands on his shoulders and moved forward
to kiss him. He bent down to meet her, and
found her eyes were wet. Maybe his were, too. Then
she broke free.</p>

<p>"You're a fool, Dan Feldman," she whispered, and
began moving down the hallway and out of the council
hall of Mars.</p>

<p>Doc Feldman nodded slowly as he let her go. He
was a fool. He had always been a fool, and always
would be. And that was why he could never take over
leadership here. Fools and idealists should never govern
a world. It took practical men such as Jake to do that.</p>

<p>But the practical men needed the foolish idealists, too.
And maybe for a time here on Mars their kind of men
and his kind of fools could make one more stab at the
ancient puzzle of freedom.</p>

<p>Outside the war rockets of Earth began landing
quietly on the free soil of Mars.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
