<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It was bound to happen sooner or
later.</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Not because man failed to understand
his fellow man, but because he
failed to understand himself.</span></span></p>

the golden showers of deadly
dust and the blinding flashes that
blotted out the light from the sun.</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">And all because man continued to
confuse emotion with reason.</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">But somehow, as before, man survived....</span></span></p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Don't touch!</span></span>" Sinzor's
command shot through the
chill morning air like an
arrow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ragged little group of men
stopped dead in their tracks and
looked questioningly at their leader.
He was pointing down to an object
lying half-buried in the soil at his
feet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Another <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">death-thing</span></span>, maybe," Sinzor
said. "Another <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">'thing</span></span> our ancestors
made with which to destroy themselves."
He peered around the semi-circle
of men until he spotted the
aged one with a leg missing. "Morge!
See that this place is marked forbidden."

The hunting party moved on and
Morge stayed behind. He hobbled
about, collecting sticks and stones, arranging
them in the "forbidden-symbol"
way to form a barrier around
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">'thing</span></span>. It was because of such a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">'thing</span></span> that he'd lost a leg in his
youth. He both hated and feared the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">death-things</span></span> his ancestors had so
carelessly left lying about before they
vanished. But that wasn't right. Morge
scratched his grizzly old head and
thought hard. According to Builder,
wisest of their tribe, their ancestors
hadn't all vanished; some of them
had become the tribe--Sinzor, Builder,
and even old Morge. Very puzzling.
But it was all because of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">death-things</span></span>!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Puffing, Morge completed the barrier,
then turned for a last look at
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">'thing</span></span> gleaming dully in the pale<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
winter sunlight. How strange it
looked. In no way did it resemble the
usual <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">death-things</span></span>, most of which
were long and round with little wings
attached. This one was different, like
nothing he'd ever seen before. It was
boxlike with strange arms sticking up;
and under the arms, half-buried, was
a shelf or platform resembling vaguely
the upper portion of two legs. The
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">'thing</span></span> terrified Morge for a moment;
then, in order to prove his courage to
himself, he stepped forward and spat
on it. Nothing happened. Sneering, he
spat on it again and watched his spittle
slowly run down its side over a
strange marking like a thunderbolt--</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thunderbolt!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly Morge fell grovelling to
his one good knee. It was Thor, god
of thunder and lightning and god of
the tribe!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">And he had spat on Thor!</span></span></p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For nearly an hour he
knelt there praying forgiveness
for his sacrilege. Then, trembling, he
tore off a piece of his goatskin and
wiped the spittle off Thor's side, carefully
began to uncover the remainder
of Thor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally he lifted Thor out of the
hole and onto level ground. Kneeling
once more, he took a small drink-scoop
from his belt and placed it before
Thor. Then he pulled out his knife
and folded his single leg under him;
bending over, he cut a gash in his
wrist and let the blood flow into the
scoop until it was nearly full.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rising to his knee he said, "Oh,
Thor, please take this humble offering
to show that I am forgiven." Almost
prostrate now, he picked up the
scoop and placed it on Thor's lap beneath
his arms.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately there was a soft rumble
and humming. Fearfully old
Morge watched Thor's arms come
down, lift up the scoop and carry it
inside his huge mouth. There was a
sucking noise and the scoop was returned
empty to his lap.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Filled with joy, Morge spent another
endless time thanking Thor.
Then all of a sudden an idea seized
him. What if he carried Thor back to
the tribe and presented him to the
priest, Thougor, for all to worship
and give sacrifices to? Would not he,
the despised, the looked down upon,
be the greatest of heroes? All that was
known of Thor were the legends, but
at last they would have the actual
god!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Painfully, with many grunts and
groans, he got Thor under one arm
and staggered off towards the village,
his crutch kicking up little puffs of
dust.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Builder was having
trouble with Thougor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He almost wished now that he'd
continued his search a little longer
for a segment of humanity. He might
have found a group less primitive
who would have appreciated and understood
his help much better. But
this was the best he'd found; as it
was, he'd wandered over the continent
nearly a lifetime before even finding
these poor wretches. But they were
at least human--something that
couldn't be said for those <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">others</span></span> he'd
come in contact with all through the
past years.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now, after having been with
the tribe--the only human tribe--for
over a year, he was being balked by
this--priest! Which meant being
balked at setting up Truth and
Knowledge as the only true gods of
humanity, being balked at getting the
dam built before the spring rains, so
that there would not be another summer
drouth followed by a winter of
famine such as they had just passed
through. The dam was his first big
project; without freedom from want,
there would be little progress next
winter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost savagely he turned on
Thougor. "But why must you have
this religious festival <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></span>?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Because of the finding of the god
Thor," came Thougor's cold answer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Why the offerings of blood?<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Can't they wait? The dam <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></span> be
finished before the rains; but the loss
of blood already has so weakened the
workers that they can no longer work
for a full day."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Which is more important, worldly
or spiritual things?" Thougor replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"But there maybe won't be anyone
around to indulge in spiritual things
if there's another drouth this year!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Thor will see to it that there is
not another drouth."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Yes, I know, but wouldn't it be
wiser to be on the safe side? Suppose
somebody does something to displease
Thor?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Nobody will displease Thor! It is
my duty to see to that! I tell them
what to think, so that they won't displease
Thor."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A crafty devil you are</span></span>, Builder
thought. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manipulating this image of
Thor you talk about, so that it will
take the blood offerings of the people
and even you and that half-baked discipline
of yours, Morge. I must look
at your god Thor one of these days--</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He suddenly felt very weary and
sat down on the floor; looking up at
Thougor, he said, "But that is not
part of being civilized, to tell the
people <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></span> to think. You must <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">make</span></span>
them think without telling them what
to think. And with the dam, next winter
there will be freedom from want
for the first time. The tribe will have
a chance to think and be on the road
to civilization."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"The tribe has already found civilization
in finding Thor. By worshipping
Him as a group they have already
ceased their bickering and quarreling.
Does not that fit in with your
definition of civilization, the one you
gave my people when you first came
to us? Since the coming of Thor we
have begun to cooperate, have we
not?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"No, hardly at all. I said civilization
is cooperation among men in
adapting to environment--which includes
man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two men stared at each other,
and for awhile there was silence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Nevertheless," Thougor finally
said, "Thor and blood offerings continue!"</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Builder watched
Thougor turn and stalk out of
the tiny hovel that housed his plans
and his work, himself and his dreams.
What could he do? He could only appeal
to the tribe's reason; Thougor
could appeal to their emotions which
were far stronger. But unless emotion
was controlled, used wisely, there
could never be any reason.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Builder realized, with a sinking
heart, that he was much too old for
the job he'd undertaken. Too late in
life had he discovered these people.
Almost all his energy since youth had
been sapped just looking for a segment
of humanity. His mother and
father had told him there might be
failure, but still they had taught him
everything they could in the short
time before death had overtaken them.
They had been the only humans living
in that towering jungle of concrete
and steel. How they had gotten
there was never explained to him. It
didn't matter, though.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly Builder shook himself.
Here he was recollecting his youth instead
of concentrating on the task at
hand. He must <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></span> be getting old.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was glad of Thougor's visit. At
least he was now fully aware of the
problem to be solved. In spite of the
priest, he had to find a way of getting
that dam finished and soon. Or
maybe next year there wouldn't be
any people, for game was getting
scarcer each winter.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very little work was done that day
in spite of Builder's managing to
round up his full crew. The blood offering
each worker had given the
night before had left them tired
and listless. Only four of the fifty-four
molds running across the river
were filled with sand and gravel that
morning and afternoon--there were<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still nearly fifty to be filled. Builder
was very depressed--</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he was even more depressed
when, at the close of day, two workmen
grew careless and slipped into
the last mold being filled; their ear-splitting
shrieks brought half the
tribe up over the hill above the village
and down to the dam sight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After Builder explained what had
happened, there were angry mutterings
to the effect that Thor was displeased
with the dam and therefore
had taken lives. Nothing Builder
could say would dissuade them from
this notion, so well had Thougor indoctrinated
them with religious fear of
anything used to control nature.
Builder hadn't realized until that moment
just how much the people were
against the dam.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he saw Thougor, tall and ominous
in his cloak of black skins, come
striding through the crowd.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment he stood facing them
with his hands on his hips. There
seemed to be a silent understanding
between them. Slowly the crowd
turned and disappeared over the hill.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Thougor strode over to
Builder and said simply, "There will
be no more dam." Turning he followed
the rest of the tribe back to
the village.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Builder was thunderstruck. He
knew there was no use arguing or trying
to reason with either Thougor or
the tribe. It was too late for that; only
some drastic measure would complete
the dam now.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He walked tiredly over the black
hill and down to his shack, wondering
how he could compete with an
idol. He realized now, it had been
foolish of him to have overlooked the
possible effect Thor might have upon
the tribe. When it had been found
three months ago, he never dreamed
they would spend all their leisure in
rituals.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The god was his problem; therefore
he must get it out of the way,
himself, without expecting help from
anyone. Each evening the clouds on
the northern horizon were darkening
and drawing closer.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was night when
Builder finally stumbled into
his quarters. After lighting a pine
torch he sat down by his workbench
and buried his head in his hands. He
was too tired and upset to eat, which
was just as well--</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Outside of deliberately killing
Thougor, there was only one thing
he could do--that was to kidnap
Thor. With this realization, in spite
of the risk involved, came some peace
of mind. He hadn't the vaguest idea
just how he was to go about it, especially
since his strength was failing
him, but do it he would. First, though,
he would have to wait until sometime
before dawn when everybody--even
Thougor--was sure to be asleep.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hours dragged heavily between
then and his chosen time. Many were
the times when he longed for something
to read, although he supposed
that by this time he'd forgotten how.
Like wisps of smoke, memories of
his youth in the concrete jungle drifted
through his mind. How long ago
that all seemed now. Sometimes he
wondered if any of it had been real.
But here he was, as his parents had
wished him to be, trying to help what
was left of humanity back up the
trail. To what, he wondered? To destruction
again--this time, probably
complete and final?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He shook his old head and ran a
trembling hand through his white
shaggy hair. He'd gotten this far;
somehow he would get the rest of the
way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Builder got up and crossed over to
his sleeping pile. After tying several
skins together, he folded them under
his arm and walked out into the pre-dawn
night. His bones felt the crackling
cold of early spring as they had
never felt it before. Slowly he made
his way around the village to where
Thor was housed under a huge slanting
roof of bark and scraped skins.
He'd never seen Thor, and now<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wished he'd paid at least one visit to
the god.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like a shadow he glided carefully
through the blackness in back of the
temple until he was just inside the
rear opening. He could see clear
across the chamber, out into the pale
twinkling stars. Then he detected a
dark mass in the center of the temple
silhouetted against the stars; that
must be Thor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Swiftly Builder advanced towards
it until his foot struck something soft,
causing him to stumble and fall. As
he did so, he heard a grunt sounding
like someone being kicked in the
stomach--</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then something was on top of him,
pounding his head and shoulders with
a heavy stick of some kind. Old
Builder knew he didn't have the
strength to wrestle; he managed to
get his pile of skins unfolded and,
with his last ounce of strength, throw
them over the head of his attacker.
Somehow he managed to wiggle out
from underneath and climb to his
feet. His assailant began to scream for
help, but the heavy skins muffled his
shouts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Quickly Builder looked around for
something to hit him with. The only
thing his eye spotted was the idol. He
hobbled over and, using both arms,
dragged it off its dias. Then, with the
remainder of his strength, dropped it
squarely on top of whomever was
under the skins. There was a muted
clunk followed by silence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fearfully Builder stood there for
a moment catching his breath and
listening for anyone coming. All was
quiet except the pounding of his
heart.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As fast as he could make his arms
and hands work he rolled up the body
in the skins and painfully hoisted it
over one shoulder. With his other
hand he reached down and picked
Thor up by one of its arms, then,
staggering under the load, he started
back the way he had come.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Except for a greyish streak in the
east, it was still dark. He stumbled
and fell several times before reaching
his dwelling, but he was confident that
he had left no tracks. Every night,
even this late in the winter, the
ground froze solid.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Back inside his shed,
still in the dark, Builder unrolled
his burden and listened for any
heartbeat. There was none. As he
rolled the body up again, something
clattered to the floor. It was a crutch.
Quickly he felt for his victim's legs;
one was missing. Of all the people he
had to kill--Morge! Thougor's right
hand man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He realized he had to get rid of the
body before daylight and fast! Already
more grey was lining the eastern
horizon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He didn't know whether he had the
strength to do it or not, but he had
to get Morge up to the dam and into
one of the unfilled molds. For the time
being he would have to hide Thor
someplace inside here. He couldn't
carry both of them up to the dam.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He rolled the idol up in another set
of skins and placed it under the head
of his sleeping pile. Then, picking up
his other bundle once more, he started
for the dam.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun was just peeking over the
horizon when Builder finally stumbled
back into his dwelling and into bed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All that day, he lay there, body on
fire with fever, and heart pounding
like a drum. He was almost certain he
would soon die. "It was just as well,"
a little corner of his consciousness
said. At least he would be missing all
the frenzied excitement of Thor's disappearance
along with Morge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it looked as though he had
failed after all. In spite of removing
the god, now he was dying--and the
dam still unfinished.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day dragged on and on and he
didn't die.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After waking up in late afternoon
he felt better. He ate a handful of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nuts and figs washed down with a little
herb tea. Then as night crept over
the sky, he tottered down to the village.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever had taken place during
the day was done, and little groups of
people stood around fires resting and
talking--as though it were the old
days before the coming of Thor,
thought Builder. That was good.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Builder moved in closer to one of
the fires to warm himself against the
early spring night. Someone recognized
him--it was one of his workers--and
he was suddenly made welcome,
once again being given the place of
honor nearest the fire, as in the old
days when he'd first discovered the
humans.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Builder was dumbfounded at the
sudden cordiality. In recent days,
Thougor had done such a good job
of discrediting, he never dreamed of
regaining his old standing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he was told what had happened
during the day while he lay
almost dying:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the god and Morge were discovered
missing, Thougor had called
the village together, explaining that
Thor had left them, taking Morge as
a sacrifice because he was dissatisfied
with the tribe's paltry blood offerings
and worship. Therefore a
great death sacrifice of young men
and women must be undertaken to
pacify Thor and cause his return.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the people questioned Thougor's
order; they seemed to feel it was
the priest who had been at fault, not
themselves. After all, he was the closest
to Thor, was he not? Therefore it
was Thougor, not the village, that
Thor had become angered at. And
after holding quick council, they had
driven Thougor out into the wilderness,
telling him he was not to return
unless Thor was with him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Old Builder almost cried when he
heard this joyful news. The dam would
be completed after all, he was almost
certain. He decided to say nothing
more about religion, Thor or Thougor.
Maybe soon they would forget the
whole thing. Now he could go back to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
teaching the youngsters and some of
the brighter oldsters the methods
of writing in symbols instead of drawing
pictures.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hours and days turned
into weeks and months as
Builder taught his people what feeble
knowledge he possessed in arithmetic,
simple engineering--such as the dam--and
most of all, instilling in them
the will to want to learn and investigate
and question anything they came
in contact with--even the very thing
he was asking them to do.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the weeks passed on and the
dam was completed, he gradually
gathered around him an ardent little
group of seeker after that most elusive
of all things--"Truth".</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Builder knew that his days
were numbered now, and his work
completed; there was still one thing
he had to do, and that was permanently
to do away with Thor by dropping
the idol to the bottom of the
dam; he still hadn't examined the god
hidden under his sleeping pile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One evening after returning from a
solitary walk above the dam, he
entered his shack and lit a torch, then
almost dropped it from shock!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His dwelling was a wreck. The
place had been ransacked from top
to bottom. His sleeping pile lay in the
middle of the floor--the idol was
gone!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He turned and fled from the room,
but before he could take a dozen steps
towards the village, several shadows
glided out from behind trees and rocks
in the moonlight, resolving themselves
into men.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before he could cry out or struggle,
strong arms pinned his arms to his
body and someone clapped a dirty
hand over his mouth. He was forced
back into his hovel and the door
slammed shut. Standing in front of
him was a very bedraggled figure
whom he recognized as Thougor. He
also recognized his three other captors;
all were elderly reactionaries of the
tribe who had disapproved of him
from the beginning. In spite of his
predicament Builder felt a warm glow
of happiness course through him. If
these were the only cronies Thougor
could round up, that meant the rest
of the villagers were sympathetic with
his cause. He suddenly became aware
of Thougor's grating voice:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"It took me a little time to piece
things together, but once I did, it
didn't take me long to come back and
find the god where I might have at
first suspected it would be--right here!
For your sacrilege you will pay with
every last drop of blood you have in
your scrawny old body--and now!"
Whereupon Thougor disappeared out
of the hovel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somehow Builder had known they
were going to kill him before arousing
the rest of the tribe to the fact that
Thor was back. Thougor was taking
no chances of his standing in the way
of him or Thor ever again. But Builder
didn't care: he had sown his few seeds
of knowledge and wisdom well. Although
Thougor didn't know it, this
time he wouldn't have complete homage
from all the tribe. There would
now be doubts and questionings and
tests for both Thor and Thougor in
the ways of truth and righteousness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Thougor returned to the shack
with what, Builder thought, must be
Thor. The hand over his mouth had
twisted his head back so that he only
got a glimpse, but he didn't miss the
long knife Thougor pulled from beneath
his tattered skins, nor the large
sacrificial bowl one of the others held
below his neck. Then his head was
tilted forward and sidewise, and he got
his first full look at the god Thor. At
the sight, his whole body shook with
smothered laughter. Below the two
arms and etched thunderbolt were
large block letters standing out in bold
relief:</p>

            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
