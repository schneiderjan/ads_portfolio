<h2><a name="CHAPTER_ONE" id="CHAPTER_ONE"></a>CHAPTER ONE</h2>


<p>Jed Cochrane tried to be cynical as the helicab
hummed softly through the night over the city. The cab
flew at two thousand feet, where lighted buildings seemed
to soar toward it from the canyons which were streets.
There were lights and people everywhere, and Cochrane
sardonically reminded himself that he was no better than
anybody else, only he'd been trying to keep from realizing
it. He looked down at the trees and shrubbery on the
roof-tops, and at a dance that was going on atop one
of the tallest buildings. All roofs were recreation-spaces
nowadays. They were the only spaces available. When you
looked down at a city like this, you had cynical thoughts.
Fourteen million people in this city. Ten million in that.
Eight in another and ten in another still, and twelve million
in yet another ... Big cities. Swarming millions of
people, all desperately anxious&mdash;so Cochrane realized
bitterly&mdash;all desperately anxious about their jobs and
keeping them.</p>

<p>"Even as me and I," said Cochrane harshly to himself.
"Sure! I'm shaking in my shoes right along with the rest
of them!"</p>

<p>But it hurt to realize that he'd been kidding himself.
He'd thought he was important. Important, at least, to
the advertising firm of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and
Fallowe. But right now he was on the way&mdash;like a common
legman&mdash;to take the moon-rocket to Lunar City,
and he'd been informed of it just thirty minutes ago. Then
he'd been told casually to get to the rocket-port right
away. His secretary and two technical men and a writer
were taking the same rocket. He'd get his instructions
from Dr. William Holden on the way.</p>

<p>A part of his mind said indignantly, "<i>Wait till I get
Hopkins on the phone! It was a mixup! He wouldn't
send me off anywhere with the Dikkipatti Hour depending
on me! He's not that crazy!</i>" But he was on his way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to the space-port, regardless. He'd raged when the message
reached him. He'd insisted that he had to talk to
Hopkins in person before he obeyed any such instructions.
But he was on his way to the space-port. He was
riding in a helicab, and he was making adjustments
in his own mind to the humiliation he unconsciously
foresaw. There were really three levels of thought in
his mind. One had adopted a defensive cynicism, and
one desperately insisted that he couldn't be as unimportant
as his instructions implied, and the third watched the
other two as the helicab flew with cushioned booming
noises over the dark canyons of the city and the innumerable
lonely lights of the rooftops.</p>

<p>There was a thin roaring sound, high aloft. Cochrane
jerked his head back. The stars filled all the firmament,
but he knew what to look for. He stared upward.</p>

<p>One of the stars grew brighter. He didn't know when
he first picked it out, but he knew when he'd found it.
He fixed his eyes on it. It was a very white star, and
for a space of minutes it seemed in no wise different
from its fellows. But it grew brighter. Presently it was
very bright. It was brighter than Sirius. In seconds more
it was brighter than Venus. It increased more and more
rapidly in its brilliance. It became the brightest object in
all the heavens except the crescent moon, and the cold
intensity of its light was greater than any part of that.
Then Cochrane could see that this star was not quite
round. He could detect the quarter-mile-long flame of the
rocket-blast.</p>

<p>It came down with a rush. He saw the vertical, stabbing
pencil of light plunge earthward. It slowed remarkably
as it plunged, with all the flying aircraft above the
city harshly lighted by its glare. The space-port itself
showed clearly. Cochrane saw the buildings, and the
other moon-rockets waiting to take off in half an hour
or less.</p>

<p>The white flame hit the ground and splashed. It spread
out in a wide flat disk of intolerable brightness. The
sleek hull of the ship which still rode the flame down
glinted vividly as it settled into the inferno of its own
making.</p>

<p>Then the light went out. The glare cut off abruptly.
There was only a dim redness where the space-port tarmac
had been made incandescent for a little while. That
glow faded&mdash;and Cochrane became aware of the enormous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
stillness. He had not really noticed the rocket's
deafening roar until it ended.</p>

<p>The helicab flew onward almost silently, with only
the throbbing pulses of its overhead vanes making any
sound at all.</p>

<p>"<i>I kidded myself about those rockets, too</i>," said Cochrane
bitterly to himself. "<i>I thought getting to the moon
meant starting to the stars. New worlds to live on. I had
a lot more fun before I found out the facts of life!</i>"</p>

<p>But he knew that this cynicism and this bitterness came
out of the hurt to the vanity that still insisted everything
was a mistake. He'd received orders which disillusioned
him about his importance to the firm and to the business
to which he'd given years of his life. It hurt to find out that
he was just another man, just another <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'expendible'">expendable</ins>. Most
people fought against making the discovery, and some succeeded
in avoiding it. But Cochrane saw his own self-deceptions
with a savage clarity even as he tried to keep
them. He did not admire himself at all.</p>

<p>The helicab began to slant down toward the space-port
buildings. The sky was full of stars. The earth&mdash;of course&mdash;was
covered with buildings. Except for the space-port
there was no unoccupied ground for thirty miles in any direction.
The cab was down to a thousand feet. To five
hundred. Cochrane saw the just-arrived rocket with tender-vehicles
running busily to and fro and hovering around it.
He saw the rocket he should take, standing upright on the
faintly lighted field.</p>

<p>The cab touched ground. Cochrane stood up and paid
the fare. He got out and the cab rose four or five feet
and flitted over to the waiting-line.</p>

<p>He went into the space-port building. He felt himself
growing more bitter still. Then he found Bill Holden&mdash;Doctor
William Holden&mdash;standing dejectedly against a
wall.</p>

<p>"I believe you've got some orders for me, Bill," said
Cochrane sardonically. "And just what psychiatric help
can I give you?"</p>

<p>Holden said tiredly:</p>

<p>"I don't like this any better than you do, Jed. I'm
scared to death of space-travel. But go get your ticket
and I'll tell you about it on the way up. It's a special
production job. I'm roped in on it too."</p>

<p>"Happy holiday!" said Cochrane, because Holden
looked about as miserable as a man could look.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>He went to the ticket desk. He gave his name. On
request, he produced identification. Then he said sourly:</p>

<p>"While you're working on this I'll make a phone-call."</p>

<p>He went to a pay visiphone. And again there were different
levels of awareness in his mind&mdash;one consciously
and defensively cynical, and one frightened at the revelation
of his unimportance, and the third finding the others
an unedifying spectacle.</p>

<p>He put the call through with an over-elaborate confidence
which he angrily recognized as an attempt to deceive
himself. He got the office. He said <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'calmy'.">calmly</ins>:</p>

<p>"This is Jed Cochrane. I asked for a visiphone contact
with Mr. Hopkins."</p>

<p>He had a secretary on the phone-screen. She looked at
memos and said pleasantly:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Mr. Hopkins is at dinner. He said he couldn't
be disturbed, but for you to go on to the moon according
to your instructions, Mr. Cochrane."</p>

<p>Cochrane hung up and raged, with one part of his
mind. Another part&mdash;and he despised it&mdash;began to argue
that after all, he had better wait before thinking there was
any intent to humiliate him. After all, his orders must
have been issued with due consideration. The third part
disliked the other two parts intensely&mdash;one for raging without
daring to speak, and one for trying to find alibis for
not even raging. He went back to the ticket-desk. The
clerk said heartily:</p>

<p>"Here you are! The rest of your party's already on
board, Mr. Cochrane. You'd better hurry! <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphenated to correspond with other usage in text.">Take-off's</ins> in
five minutes."</p>

<p>Holden joined him. They went through the gate and
got into the tender-vehicle that would rush them out to
the rocket. Holden said heavily:</p>

<p>"I was waiting for you and hoping you wouldn't come.
I'm not a good traveller, Jed."</p>

<p>The small vehicle rushed. To a city man, the dark
expanse of the space-port was astounding. Then a spidery
metal framework swallowed the tender-truck, and them.
The vehicle stopped. An elevator accepted them and lifted
an indefinite distance through the night, toward the stars. A
sort of gangplank with a canvas siderail reached out
across emptiness. Cochrane crossed it, and found himself
at the bottom of a spiral ramp inside the rocket's passenger-compartment.
A stewardess looked at the tickets.
She led the way up, and stopped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is your seat, Mr. Cochrane," she said professionally.
"I'll strap you in this first time. You'll do it later."</p>

<p>Cochrane lay down in a contour-chair with an eight-inch
mattress of foam rubber. The stewardess adjusted
straps. He thought bitter, ironic thoughts. A voice said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cochrane!"</p>

<p>He turned his head. There was Babs Deane, his secretary,
with her eyes very bright. She regarded him from a
contour-chair exactly opposite his. She said happily:</p>

<p>"Mr. West and Mr. Jamison are the science men, Mr.
Cochrane. I got Mr. Bell as the writer."</p>

<p>"A great triumph!" Cochrane told her. "Did you get
any idea what all this is about? Why we're going up?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Babs cheerfully. "I haven't the least
idea. But I'm going to the moon! It's the most wonderful
thing that ever happened to me!"</p>

<p>Cochrane shrugged his shoulders. Shrugging was not
comfortable in the straps that held him. Babs was a good
secretary. She was the only one Cochrane had ever had
who did not try to make use of her position as secretary
to the producer of the Dikkipatti Hour on television.
Other secretaries had used their nearness to him to wangle
acting or dancing or singing assignments on other
and lesser shows. As a rule they lasted just four public
appearances before they were back at desks, spoiled for
further secretarial use by their taste of fame. But Babs
hadn't tried that. Yet she'd jumped at a chance for a
trip to the moon.</p>

<p>A panel up toward the nose of the rocket&mdash;the upper
end of this passenger compartment&mdash;glowed suddenly.
Flaming red letters said, "<i><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphenated to correspond with other usage in text.">Take-off</ins>, ninety seconds.</i>"</p>

<p>Cochrane found an ironic flavor in the thought that
splendid daring and incredible technology had made his
coming journey possible. Heroes had ventured magnificently
into the emptiness beyond Earth's atmosphere. Uncountable
millions of dollars had been spent. Enormous
intelligence and infinite pains had been devoted to making
possible a journey of two hundred thirty-six thousand
miles through sheer nothingness. This was the most splendid
achievement of human science&mdash;the reaching of a
satellite of Earth and the building of a human city there.</p>

<p>And for what? Undoubtedly so that one Jed Cochrane
could be ordered by telephone, by somebody's secretary,
to go and get on a passenger-rocket and get to the moon.
Go&mdash;having failed to make a protest because his boss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
wouldn't interrupt dinner to listen&mdash;so he could keep his
job by obeying. For this splendid purpose, scientists had
labored and dedicated men had risked their lives.</p>

<p>Of course, Cochrane reminded himself with conscious
justice, of course there was the very great value of moon-mail
cachets to devotees of philately. There was the value
of the tourist facilities to anybody who could spend that
much money for something to brag about afterward.
There were the solar-heat mines&mdash;running at a slight loss&mdash;and
various other fine achievements. There was even
a <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphen removed to correspond with other usage in text.">nightclub</ins> in Lunar City where one highball cost the
equivalent of&mdash;say&mdash;a week's pay for a secretary like
Babs. And&mdash;</p>

<p>The panel changed its red glowing sign. It said: "<i>Take-off
forty-five seconds.</i>"</p>

<p>Somewhere down below a door closed with a cushioned
soft definiteness. The inside of the rocket suddenly
seemed extraordinarily still. The silence was oppressive.
It was dead. Then there came the whirring of very many
electric fans, stirring up the air.</p>

<p>The stewardess' voice came matter-of-factly from below
him in the upended cylinder which was the passenger-space.</p>

<p>"We take off in forty-five seconds. You will find yourself
feeling very heavy. There is no cause to be alarmed.
If you observe that breathing is oppressive, the oxygen
content of the air in this ship is well above earth-level,
and you will not need to breathe so deeply. Simply relax
in your chair. Everything has been thought of. Everything
has been tested repeatedly. You need not disturb
yourself at all. Simply relax."</p>

<p>Silence. Two heart-beats. Three.</p>

<p>There was a roar. It was a deep, booming, numbing
roar that came from somewhere outside the rocket's hull.
Simultaneously, something thrust Cochrane deep into the
foam-cushions of his contour-chair. He felt the cushion
piling up on all sides of his body so that it literally surrounded
him. It resisted the tendency of his arms and
legs and abdomen to flatten out and flow sidewise, to
spread him in a thin layer over the chair in which he
rested.</p>

<p>He felt his cheeks dragged back. He was unduly conscious
of the weight of objects in his pockets. His stomach
pressed hard against his backbone. His sensations were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
those of someone being struck a hard, prolonged blow all
over his body.</p>

<p>It was so startling a sensation, though he'd read about
it, that he simply stayed still and blankly submitted to it.
Presently he felt himself gasp. Presently, again, he noticed
that one of his feet was going to sleep. He tried to move
it and succeeded only in stirring it feebly. The roaring
went on and on and on....</p>

<p>The red letters in the panel said: "<i>First stage ends in
five seconds</i>."</p>

<p>By the time he'd read it, the rocket hiccoughed and
stopped. Then he felt a surge of panic. He was falling!
He had no weight! It was the sensation of a suddenly
dropping elevator a hundred times multiplied. He bounced
out of the depression in the foam-cushion. He was prevented
from floating away only by the straps that held
him.</p>

<p>There was a sputter and a series of jerks. Then he had
weight again as roarings began once more. This was not
the ghastly continued impact of the take-off, but still it
was weight&mdash;considerably greater weight than the normal
weight of Earth. Cochrane wiggled the foot that had
gone to sleep. Pins and needles lessened their annoyance
as sensation returned to it. He was able to move his arms
and hands. They felt abnormally heavy, and he experienced
an extreme and intolerable weariness. He wanted to
go to sleep.</p>

<p>This was the second-stage rocket-phase. The moon-rocket
had blasted off at six gravities acceleration until
clear of atmosphere and a little more. Acceleration-chairs
of remarkably effective design, plus the pre-saturation of
one's blood with oxygen, made so high an acceleration
safe and not unendurable for the necessary length of
time it lasted. Now, at three gravities, one did not feel
on the receiving end of a violent thrust, but one did feel
utterly worn out and spent. Most people stayed awake
through the six-gravity stage and went heavily to sleep
under three gravities.</p>

<p>Cochrane fought the sensation of fatigue. He had not
liked himself for accepting the orders that had brought
him here. They had been issued in bland confidence that
he had no personal affairs which could not be abandoned
to obey cryptic orders from the secretary of a boss he
had actually never seen. He felt a sort of self-contempt
which it would have been restful to forget in three-gravity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
sleep. But he grimaced and held himself awake to
contemplate the unpretty spectacle of himself and his
actions.</p>

<p>The red light said: "<i>Second stage ends ten seconds.</i>"</p>

<p>And in ten seconds the rockets hiccoughed once more
and were silent, and there was that sickening feeling of
free fall, but he grimly made himself think of it as soaring
upward instead of dropping&mdash;which was the fact, too&mdash;and
waited until the third-stage rockets boomed suddenly
and went on and on and on.</p>

<p>This was nearly normal acceleration; the effect of this
acceleration was the feel of nearly normal weight. He
felt about as one would feel in Earth in a contour-chair
tilted back so that one faced the ceiling. He knew approximately
where the ship would be by this time, and
it ought to have been a thrill. Cochrane was hundreds of
miles above Earth and headed eastward out and up. If
a port were open at this height, his glance should span
continents.</p>

<p>No.... The ship had taken off at night. It would still
be in Earth's shadow. There would be nothing at all to be
seen below, unless one or two small patches of misty
light which would be Earth's too-many great cities. But
overhead there would be stars by myriads and myriads,
of every possible color and degree of brightness. They
would crowd each other for room in which to shine. The
rocket-ship was spiralling out and out and up and up, to
keep its rendezvous with the space platform.</p>

<p>The platform, of course, was that artificial satellite of
Earth which was four thousand miles out and went around
the planet in a little over four hours, traveling from west
to east. It had been made because to break the bonds of
Earth's gravity was terribly costly in fuel&mdash;when a ship
had to accelerate slowly to avoid harm to human cargo.
The space platform was a filling station in emptiness, at
which the moon-rocket would refuel for its next and longer
and much less difficult journey of two hundred thirty-odd
thousand miles.</p>

<p>The stewardess came up the ramp, moving briskly.
She stopped and glanced at each passenger in each chair
in turn. When Cochrane turned his open eyes upon her,
she said soothingly:</p>

<p>"There's no need to be disturbed. Everything is going
perfectly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not disturbed," said Cochrane. "I'm not even
nervous. I'm perfectly all right."</p>

<p>"But you should be drowsy!" she observed, concerned.
"Most people are. If you nap you'll feel better for it."</p>

<p>She felt his pulse in a <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphen removed to correspond with other usage in text.">businesslike</ins> manner. It was
normal.</p>

<p>"Take my nap for me," said Cochrane, "or put it back
in stock. I don't want it. I'm perfectly all right."</p>

<p>She considered him carefully. She was remarkably
pretty. But her manner was strictly detached. She said:</p>

<p>"There's a button. You can reach it if you need anything.
You may call me by pushing it."</p>

<p>He shrugged. He lay still as she went on to inspect
the other passengers. There was nothing to do and nothing
to see. Travellers were treated pretty much like parcels,
these days. Travel, like television entertainment and most
of the other facilities of human life, was designed for
the seventy-to-ninety-per-cent of the human race whose
likes and dislikes and predilections could be learned exactly
by surveys. Anybody who didn't like what everybody
liked, or didn't react like everybody reacted, was
subject to annoyances. Cochrane resigned himself to them.</p>

<p>The red light-letters changed again, considerably later.
This time they said: "<i>Free flight, thirty seconds.</i>"</p>

<p>They did not say "free fall," which was the technical
term for a rocket coasting upward or downward in space.
But Cochrane braced himself, and his stomach-muscles
were tense when the rockets stopped again and stayed
off. The sensation of continuous fall began. An electronic
speaker beside his chair began to speak. There were other
such mechanisms beside each other passenger-chair, and
the interior of the rocket filled with a soft murmur which
was sardonically like choral recitation.</p>

<p>"<i>The sensation of weightlessness you now experience</i>,"
said the voice soothingly, "<i>is natural at this stage of your
flight. The ship has attained its maximum intended speed
and is still rising to meet the space platform. You may
consider that we have left atmosphere and its limitations
behind. Now we have spread sails of inertia and glide on
a wind of pure momentum toward our destination. The
feeling of weightlessness is perfectly normal. You will be
greatly interested in the space platform. We will reach it
in something over two hours of free flight. It is an artificial
satellite, with an air-lock our ship will enter for refueling.
You will be able to leave the ship and move about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
inside the Platform, to lunch if you choose, to buy souvenirs
and mail them back and to view Earth from a height
of four thousand miles through quartz-glass windows.
Then, as now, you will feel no sensation of weight. You
will be taken on a tour of the space platform if you wish.
There are rest-rooms&mdash;.</i>"</p>

<p>Cochrane grimly endured the rest of the taped lecture.
He thought sourly to himself: "<i>I'm a captive audience
without even an interest in the production tricks.</i>"</p>

<p>Presently he saw Bill Holden's head. The psychiatrist
had squirmed inside the straps that held him, and now
was staring about within the rocket. His complexion was
greenish.</p>

<p>"I understand you're to brief me," Cochrane told him,
"on the way up. Do you want to tell me now what all
this is about? I'd like a nice dramatic narrative, with
gestures."</p>

<p>Holden said sickly:</p>

<p>"Go to hell, won't you?"</p>

<p>His head disappeared. Space-nausea was, of course, as
definite an ailment as seasickness. It came from no weight.
But Cochrane seemed to be immune. He turned his mind
to the possible purposes of his journey. He knew nothing
at all. His own personal share in the activities of Kursten,
Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe&mdash;the biggest advertising
agency in the world&mdash;was the production of the Dikkipatti
Hour, top-talent television show, regularly every
Wednesday night between eight-thirty and nine-thirty
o'clock central U. S. time. It was a good show. It was
among the ten most popular shows on three continents.
It was not reasonable that he be ordered to drop it and
take orders from a psychiatrist, even one he'd known
unprofessionally for years. But there was not much, these
days, that really made sense.</p>

<p>In a world where cities with populations of less than
five millions were considered small towns, values were
peculiar. One of the deplorable results of living in a
world over-supplied with inhabitants was that there were
too many people and not enough jobs. When one had
a good job, and somebody higher up than oneself gave
an order, it was obeyed. There was always somebody
else or several somebodies waiting for every job there
was&mdash;hoping for it, maybe praying for it. And if a good
job was lost, one had to start all over.</p>

<p>This task might be anything. It was not, however, connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in any way with the weekly production of the Dikkipatti
Hour. And if that production were scamped this
week because Cochrane was away, he would be the one
to take the loss in reputation. The fact that he was on
the moon wouldn't count. It would be assumed that he
was slipping. And a slip was not good. It was definitely
not good!</p>

<p>"<i>I could do a documentary right now</i>," Cochrane told
himself angrily, "<i>titled 'Man-afraid-of-his-job.' I could
make a very authentic production. I've got the material</i>!"</p>

<p>He felt weight for a moment. It was accompanied by
booming noises. The sounds were not in the air outside,
because there was no air. They were reverberations of
the rocket-motors themselves, transmitted to the fabric of
the ship. The ship's steering-rockets were correcting the
course of the vessel and&mdash;yes, there was another surge of
power&mdash;nudging it to a more correct line of flight to
meet the space platform coming up from behind. The
platform went around the world six times a day, four
thousand miles out. During three of its revolutions anybody
on the ground, anywhere, could spot it in daylight
as an infinitesimal star, bright enough to be seen against
the sky's blueness, rising in the west and floating eastward
to set at the place of sunrise.</p>

<p>There was again weightlessness. A rocket-ship doesn't
burn its rocket-engines all the time. It runs them to get
started, and it runs them to stop, but it does not run them
to travel. This ship was floating above the Earth, which
might be a vast sunlit ball filling half the universe below
the rocket, or might be a blackness as of the Pit. Cochrane
had lost track of time, but not of the shattering effect
of being snatched from the job he knew and thought
important, to travel incredibly to do something he had
no idea of. He felt, in his mind, like somebody who climbs
stairs in the dark and tries to take a step that isn't there.
It was a shock to find that his work wasn't important even
in the eyes of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe.
That he didn't count. That nothing counted ...</p>

<p>There was another dull booming outside and another
touch of weight. Then the rocket floated on endlessly.</p>

<p>A long time later, something touched the ship's outer
hull. It was a definite, positive clanking sound. And then
there was the gentlest and vaguest of tuggings, and Cochrane
could feel the ship being maneuvered. He knew it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
had made contact with the space platform and was being
drawn inside its lock.</p>

<p>There was still no weight. The stewardess began to unstrap
the passengers one by one, supplying each with
magnetic-soled slippers. Cochrane heard her giving instructions
in their use. He knew the air-lock was being
filled with air from the huge, globular platform. In time
the door at the back&mdash;bottom&mdash;base of the passenger-compartment
opened. Somebody said flatly:</p>

<p>"Space platform! The ship will be in this air-lock for
some three hours plus for refueling. Warning will be given
before departure. Passengers have the freedom of the platform
and will be given every possible privilege."</p>

<p>The magnetic-soled slippers did hold one's feet to the
spiral ramp, but one had to hold on to a hand-rail to make
progress. On the way down to the exit door, Cochrane
encountered Babs. She said breathlessly:</p>

<p>"I can't believe I'm really here!"</p>

<p>"I can believe it," said Cochrane, "without even liking
it particularly. Babs, who told you to come on this trip?
Where'd all the orders come from?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hopkins' secretary," said Babs happily. "She
didn't tell me to come. I managed that! She said for me
to name two science men and two writers who could
work with you. I told her one writer was more than enough
for any production job, but you'd need me. I assumed
it was a production job. So she changed the orders and
here I am!"</p>

<p>"Fine!" said Cochrane. His sense of the ironic deepened.
He'd thought he was an executive and reasonably
important. But somebody higher up than he was had disposed
of him with absent-minded finality, and that man's
secretary and his own had determined all the details, and
he didn't count at all. He was a pawn in the hands of
firm-partners and assorted secretaries. "Let me know what
my job's to be and how to do it, Babs."</p>

<p>Babs nodded. She didn't catch the sarcasm. But she
couldn't think very straight, just now. She was on the
space platform, which was the second most glamorous
spot in the universe. The most glamorous spot, of course,
was the moon.</p>

<p>Cochrane hobbled ashore into the platform, having
no weight whatever. He was able to move only by the
curious sticky adhesion of his magnetic-soled slippers to
the steel floor-plates beneath him. Or&mdash;were they beneath?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
There was a crew member walking upside down on a
floor which ought to be a ceiling directly over Cochrane's
head. He opened a door in a side-wall and went in, still
upside down. Cochrane felt a sudden dizziness, at that.</p>

<p>But he went on, using hand-grips. Then he saw Dr.
William Holden looking greenish and ill and trying sickishly
to answer questions from West and Jamison and
Bell, who had been plucked from their private lives just
as Cochrane had and were now clamorously demanding
of Bill Holden that he explain what had happened to
them.</p>

<p>Cochrane snapped angrily:</p>

<p>"Leave the man alone! He's space-sick! If you get him
too much upset this place will be a mess!"</p>

<p>Holden closed his eyes and said gratefully:</p>

<p>"Shoo them away, Jed, and then come back."</p>

<p>Cochrane waved his hands at them. They went away,
stumbling and holding on to each other in the eerie dream-likeness
and nightmarish situation of no-weight-whatever.
There were other passengers from the moon-rocket in this
great central space of the platform. There was a fat woman
looking indignantly at the picture of a weighing-scale
painted on the wall. Somebody had painted it, with a
dial-hand pointing to zero pounds. A sign said, "<i>Honest
weight, no gravity.</i>" There was the stewardess from the
rocket, off duty here. She smoked a cigarette in the blast
of an electric fan. There was a party of moon-tourists
giggling foolishly and clutching at everything and buying
souvenirs to mail back to Earth.</p>

<p>"All right, Bill," said Cochrane. "They're gone. Now
tell me why all the not inconsiderable genius in the employ
of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe, in my
person, has been mobilized and sent up to the moon?"</p>

<p>Bill Holden swallowed. He stood up with his eyes
closed, holding onto a side-rail in the great central room
of the platform.</p>

<p>"I have to keep my eyes shut," he explained, queasily.
"It makes me ill to see people walking on side-walls and
across ceilings."</p>

<p>A stout tourist was doing exactly that at the moment.
If one could walk anywhere at all with magnetic-soled
shoes, one could walk everywhere. The stout man did
walk up the side-wall. He adventured onto the ceiling,
where he was head-down to the balance of his party. He
stood there looking up&mdash;down&mdash;at them, and he wore a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
peculiarly astonished and half-frightened and wholly foolish
grin. His wife squealed for him to come down: that
she couldn't bear looking at him so.</p>

<p>"All right," said Cochrane. "You're keeping your eyes
closed. But I'm supposed to take orders from you. What
sort of orders are you going to give?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure yet," said Holden thinly. "We are sent
up here on a private job for Hopkins&mdash;one of your bosses.
Hopkins has a daughter. She's married to a man named
Dabney. He's neurotic. He's made a great scientific discovery
and it isn't properly appreciated. So you and I
and your team of tame scientists&mdash;we're on our way to
the Moon to save his reason."</p>

<p>"Why save his reason?" asked Cochrane cynically. "If
it makes him happy to be a crackpot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It doesn't," said Holden, with his eyes still closed. He
gulped. "Your job and a large part of my practice depends
on keeping him out of a looney-bin. It amounts to
a public-relations job, a production, with me merely censoring
aspects that might be bad for Dabney's psyche.
Otherwise he'll be frustrated."</p>

<p>"Aren't we all?" demanded Cochrane. "Who in hades
does he think he is? Most of us want appreciation, but
we have to be glad when we do our work and get paid
for it! We&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he swore bitterly. He had been taken off the job
he'd spent years learning to do acceptably, to phoney a
personal satisfaction for the son-in-law of one of the partners
of the firm he worked for. It was humiliation to be
considered merely a lackey who could be ordered to perform
personal services for his boss, without regard to the
damage to the work he was really responsible for. It was
even more humiliating to know he had to do it because
he couldn't afford not to.</p>

<p>Babs appeared, obviously gloating over the mere fact
that she was walking in magnetic-soled slippers on the
steel decks of the space platform. Her eyes were very
bright. She said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cochrane, hadn't you better come look at Earth
out of the quartz Earthside windows?"</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Cochrane bitterly. "If it wasn't that
I'd have to hold onto something with both hands, in order
to do it, I'd be kicking myself. Why should I want to do
tourist stuff?"</p>

<p>"So," said Babs, "so later on you can tell when a writer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
or a scenic designer tries to put something over on you
in a space platform show."</p>

<p>Cochrane grimaced.</p>

<p>"In theory, I should. But do you realize what all this
is about? I just learned!" When Babs shook her head he
said sardonically, "We are on the way to the Moon to
stage a private production out of sheer cruelty. We're
hired to rob a happy man of the luxury of feeling sorry
for himself. We're under Holden's orders to cure a man of
being a crackpot!"</p>

<p>Babs hardly listened. She was too much filled with the
zest of being where she'd never dared hope to be able to go.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to be cured of being a crackpot,"
protested Cochrane, "if only I could afford such a luxury!
I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>Babs said urgently:</p>

<p>"You'll have to hurry, really! They told me it starts in
ten minutes, so I came to find you right away."</p>

<p>"What starts?"</p>

<p>"We're in eclipse now," explained Babs, starry-eyed.
"We're in the Earth's shadow. In about five minutes we'll
be coming out into sunlight again, and we'll see the new
Earth!"</p>

<p>"Guarantee that it will be a new Earth," Cochrane
said morosely, "and I'll come. I didn't do too well on the
old one."</p>

<p>But he followed her in all the embarrassment of walking
on magnetic-soled shoes in a total absence of effective
gravity. It was quite a job simply to start off. Without
precaution, if he merely tried to march away from where
he was, his feet would walk out from under him and he'd
be left lying on his back in mid-air. Again, to stop without
putting one foot out ahead for a prop would mean
that after his feet paused, his body would continue onward
and he would achieve a full-length face-down flop.
And besides, one could not walk with a regular up-and-down
motion, or in seconds he would find his feet churning
emptiness in complete futility.</p>

<p>Cochrane tried to walk, and then irritably took a hand-rail
and hauled himself along it, with his legs trailing behind
him like the tail of a swimming mermaid. He thought
of the simile and was not impressed by his own dignity.</p>

<p>Presently Babs halted herself in what was plainly a
metal blister in the outer skin of the platform. There was
a round quartz window, showing the inside of steel-plate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
windows beyond it. Babs pushed a button marked "<i>Shutter</i>,"
and the valves of steel drew back.</p>

<p>Cochrane blinked, lifted even out of his irritableness
by the sight before him.</p>

<p>He saw the immensity of the heavens, studded with innumerable
stars. Some were brighter than others, and they
were of every imaginable color. Tiny glintings of lurid
tint&mdash;through the Earth's atmosphere they would blend
into an indefinite faint luminosity&mdash;appeared so close together
that there seemed no possible interval. However
tiny the appearance of a gap, one had but to look at it
for an instant to perceive infinitesimal flecks of colored
fire there, also.</p>

<p>Each tiniest glimmering was a sun. But that was not
what made Cochrane catch his breath.</p>

<p>There was a monstrous space of nothingness immediately
before his eyes. It was round and vast and near. It
was black with the utter blackness of the Pit. It was Earth,
seen from its eight-thousand-mile-wide shadow, unlighted
even by the Moon. There was no faintest relief from its
absolute darkness. It was as if, in the midst of the splendor
of the heavens, there was a chasm through which one
glimpsed the unthinkable nothing from which creation
was called in the beginning. Until one realized that this
was simply the dark side of Earth, the spectacle was one
of hair-raising horror.</p>

<p>After a moment Cochrane said with a carefully steadied
voice:</p>

<p>"My most disparaging opinions of Earth were never as
black as this!"</p>

<p>"Wait," said Babs confidently.</p>

<p>Cochrane waited. He had to hold carefully in his mind
that this visible abyss, this enormity of purest dark, was
not an opening into nothingness but was simply Earth at
night as seen from space.</p>

<p>Then he saw a faint, faint arch of color forming at its
edge. It spread swiftly. Immediately, it seemed, there was
a pinkish glowing line among the multitudinous stars. It
was red. It was very, very bright. It became a complete
half-circle. It was the light of the sun refracted around
the edge of the world.</p>

<p>Within minutes&mdash;it seemed in seconds&mdash;the line of light
was a glory among the stars. And then, very swiftly, the
blazing orb which was the sun appeared from behind
Earth. It was intolerably bright, but it did not brighten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the firmament. It swam among all the myriads of myriads
of suns, burning luridly and in a terrible silence, with
visibly writhing prominences rising from the edge of its
disk. Cochrane squinted at it with light-dazzled eyes.</p>

<p>Then Babs cried softly:</p>

<p>"Beautiful! Oh, beautiful!"</p>

<p>And Cochrane shielded his eyes and saw the world new-born
before him. The arc of light became an arch and
then a crescent, and swelled even as he looked. Dawn
flowed below the space platform, and it seemed that seas
and continents and clouds and beauty poured over the
disk of darkness before him.</p>

<p>He stood here, staring, until the steel shutters slowly
closed. Babs said in regret:</p>

<p>"You have to keep your hand on the button to keep
the shutters open. Else the window might get pitted with
dust."</p>

<p>Cochrane said cynically:</p>

<p>"And how much good will it have done me to see that,
Babs? How can that be faked in a studio&mdash;and how much
would a television screen show of it?"</p>

<p>He turned away. Then he added sourly:</p>

<p>"You stay and look if you like, Babs. I've already had
my vanity smashed to little bits. If I look at that again I'll
want to weep in pure frustration because I can't do anything
even faintly as well worth watching. I prefer to cut
down my notions of the cosmos to a tolerable size. But
you go ahead and look!"</p>

<p>He went back to Holden. Holden was painfully dragging
himself back into the rocket-ship. Cochrane went
with him. They returned, weightless, to the admirably
designed contour-chairs in which they had traveled to this
place, and in which they would travel farther. Cochrane
settled down to stare numbly at the wall above him. He
had been humiliated enough by the actions of one of the
heads of an advertising agency. He found himself resenting,
even as he experienced, the humbling which had been
imposed upon him by the cosmos itself.</p>

<p>Presently the other passengers returned, and the moonship
was maneuvered out of the lock and to emptiness
again, and again presently rockets roared and there was
further feeling of intolerable weight. But it was not as bad
as the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphenated to correspond with other usage in text.">take-off</ins> from Earth.</p>

<p>There followed some ninety-six hours of pure tedium.
After the first accelerating blasts, the rockets were silent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
There was no weight. There was nothing to hear except
the droning murmur of unresting electric fans, stirring the
air ceaselessly so that excess moisture from breathing
could be extracted by the dehumidifiers. But for them&mdash;if
the air had been left stagnant&mdash;the journey would have
been insupportable.</p>

<p>There was nothing to see, because ports opening on
outer space were not safe for passengers to look through.
Mere humans, untrained to keep their minds on technical
matters, could break down at the spectacle of the universe.
There could be no activity.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers took dozy-pills. Cochrane did
not. It was against the law for dozy-pills to produce a
sensation of euphoria, of well-being. The law considered
that pleasure might lead to addiction. But if a pill merely
made a person drowsy, so that he dozed for hours halfway
between sleeping and awake, no harm appeared to
be done. Yet there were plenty of dozy-pill addicts. Many
people were not especially anxious to feel good. They
were quite satisfied not to feel anything at all.</p>

<p>Cochrane couldn't take that way of escape. He lay
strapped in his chair and thought unhappily of many
things. He came to feel unclean, as people used to feel
when they traveled for days on end on railroad trains.
There was no possibility of a bath. One could not even
change clothes, because baggage went separately to the
moon in a robot freight-rocket, which was faster and
cheaper than a passenger transport, but would kill anybody
who tried to ride it. Fifteen-and twenty-gravity acceleration
is economical of fuel, and six-gravity is not, but
nobody can live through a twenty-gravity lift-off from
Earth. So passengers stayed in the clothes in which they
entered the ship, and the only possible concession to
fastidiousness was the disposable underwear one could get
and change to in the rest-rooms.</p>

<p>Babs Deane did not take dozy-pills either, but Cochrane
knew better than to be more than remotely friendly with
her outside of office hours. He did not want to give her any
excuse to tell him anything for his own good. So he spoke
pleasantly and kept company only with his own thoughts.
But he did notice that she looked rapt and starry-eyed even
through the long and dreary hours of free flight. She was
mentally tracking the moonship through the void. She'd
know when the continents of Earth were plain to see, and
the tints of vegetation on the two hemispheres&mdash;northern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and southern&mdash;and she'd know when Earth's ice-caps could
be seen, and why.</p>

<p>The stewardess was not too much of a diversion. She
was brisk and calm and soothing, but she became a trifle
reluctant to draw too near the chairs in which her passengers
rode. Presently Cochrane made deductions and
maliciously devised a television commercial. In it, a moon-rocket
stewardess, in uniform and looking fresh and charming,
would say sweetly that she went without bathing for
days at a time on moon-trips, and did not offend because
she used whoosit's antistinkum. And then he thought
pleasurably of the heads that would roll did such a commercial
actually get on the air.</p>

<p>But he didn't make plans for the production-job he'd
been sent to the moon to do. Psychiatry was specialized,
these days, as physical medicine had been before it. An
extremely expensive diagnostician had been sent to the
moon to tap Dabney's reflexes, and he'd gravely diagnosed
frustration and suggested young Dr. Holden for the curative
treatment. Frustration was the typical neurosis of the rich,
anyhow, and Bill Holden had specialized in its cure. His
main reliance was on the making of a dramatic production
centering about his patient, which was expensive enough
and effective enough to have made him a quick reputation.
But he couldn't tell Cochrane what was required of him.
Not yet. He knew the disease but not the case. He'd have
to see and know Dabney before he could make use of the
extra-special production-crew his patient's father-in-law
had provided from the staff of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins
and Fallowe.</p>

<p>Ninety-some hours after blast-off from the space platform,
the rocket-ship turned end for end and began to
blast to kill its velocity toward the moon. It began at half-gravity&mdash;the
red glowing sign gave warning of it&mdash;and
rose to one gravity and then to two. After days of no-weight,
two gravities was punishing.</p>

<p>Cochrane thought to look at Babs. She was rapt, lost
in picturings of what must be outside the ship, which she
could not see. She'd be imagining what the television screens
had shown often enough, from film-tapes. The great pock
marked face of Luna, with its ring-mountains in incredible
numbers and complexity, and the vast open "seas" which
were solidified oceans of lava, would be clear to her mind's
eye. She would be imagining the gradual changes of the
moon's face with nearness, when the colorings appear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
From a distance all the moon seems tan or sandy in tint.
When one comes closer, there are tawny reds and slate-colors
in the mountain-cliffs, and even blues and yellows,
and everywhere there is the ashy, whitish-tan color of the
moondust.</p>

<p>Glancing at her, absorbed in her satisfaction, Cochrane
suspected that with only half an excuse she would explain
to him how the several hundreds of degrees difference in
the surface-temperature of the moon between midnight
and noon made rocks split and re-split and fracture so that
stuff as fine as talcum powder covered every space not too
sharply tilted for it to rest on.</p>

<p>The feeling of deceleration increased. For part of a
second they had the sensation of three gravities.</p>

<p>Then there was a curious, yielding jar&mdash;really very slight&mdash;and
then the feeling of excess weight ended altogether.
But not the feeling of weight. They still had weight. It
was constant. It was steady. But it was very slight.</p>

<p>They were on the moon, but Cochrane felt no elation.
In the tedious hours from the space platform he'd thought
too much. He was actually aware of the humiliations and
frustrations most men had to conceal from themselves because
they couldn't afford expensive psychiatric treatments.
Frustration was the disease of all humanity, these days.
And there was nothing that could be done about it.
Nothing! It simply wasn't possible to rebel, and rebellion
is the process by which humiliation and frustration is cured.
But one could not rebel against the plain fact that Earth
had more people on it than one planet could support.</p>

<p>Merely arriving at the moon did not seem an especially
useful achievement, either to Cochrane or to humanity at
large.</p>

<p>Things looked bad.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TWO" id="CHAPTER_TWO"></a>CHAPTER TWO</h2>


<p>Cochrane stood when the stewardess' voice authorized
the action. With sardonic docility he unfastened his
safety-belt and stepped out into the spiral, descending aisle.
It seemed strange to have weight again, even as little as this.
Cochrane weighed, on the moon, just one-sixth of what he
would weigh on Earth. Here he would tip a spring-scale at
just about twenty-seven pounds. By flexing his toes, he
could jump. Absurdly, he did. And he rose very slowly, and
hovered&mdash;feeling singularly foolish&mdash;and descended with a
vast deliberation. He landed on the ramp again feeling
absurd indeed. He saw Babs grinning at him.</p>

<p>"I think," said Cochrane, "I'll have to take up toe-dancing."</p>

<p>She laughed. Then there were clankings, and something
fastened itself outside, and after a moment the entrance-door
of the moonship opened.</p>

<p>They went down the ramp to board the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphenated to correspond with other usage in text.">moon-jeep</ins>,
holding onto the hand-rail and helping each other. The
tourist giggled foolishly. They went out the thick doorway
and found themselves in an enclosure very much like the
interior of a rather small submarine. But it did have
shielded windows&mdash;ports&mdash;and Babs instantly pulled herself
into a seat beside one and feasted her eyes. She saw
the jagged peaks nearby and the crenelated ring-mountain
wall, miles off to one side, and the smooth frozen lava of
the "sea." Across that dusty surface the horizon was remarkably
near, and Cochrane remembered vaguely that
the moon was only one-fourth the size of Earth, so its
horizon would naturally be nearer. He glanced at the stars
that shone even through the glass that denatured the sunshine.
And then he looked for Holden.</p>

<p>The <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'pyschiatrist'.">psychiatrist</ins> looked puffy and sleepy and haggard
and disheveled. When a person does have space-sickness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
even a little weight relieves the symptoms, but the consequences
last for days.</p>

<p>"Don't worry!" he said sourly when he saw Cochrane's
eyes upon him. "I won't waste any time! I'll find my man
and get to work at once. Just let me get back to Earth...."</p>

<p>There were more clankings&mdash;the jeep-bus sealing off
from the rocket. Then the vehicle stirred. The landscape
outside began to move.</p>

<p>They saw Lunar City as they approached it. It was five
giant dust-heaps, from five hundred-odd feet in height
down to three. There were airlocks at their bases and dust-covered
tunnels connecting them, and radar-bowls about
their sides. But they were dust-heaps. Which was completely
reasonable. There is no air on the moon. By day the
sun shines down with absolute ferocity. It heats everything
as with a furnace-flame. At night all heat radiates
away to empty space, and the ground-temperature drops
well below that of liquid air. So Lunar City was a group
of domes which were essentially half-balloons&mdash;hemispheres
of plastic brought from Earth and inflated and
covered with dust. With airlocks to permit entrance and
exit, they were inhabitable. They needed no framework to
support them because there were no stormwinds or earthquakes
to put stresses on them. They needed neither heating
nor cooling equipment. They were buried under forty
feet of moon-dust, with vacuum between the dust-grains.
Lunar City was not beautiful, but human beings could live
in it.</p>

<p>The jeep-bus carried them a bare half mile, and they
alighted inside a lock, and another door and another
opened and closed, and they emerged into a scene which
no amount of television film-tape could really portray.</p>

<p>The main dome was a thousand feet across and half as
high. There were green plants growing in tubs and pots.
And the air was fresh! It smelled strange. There could be
no vegetation on the rocket and it seemed new and blissful
to breathe really freshened air after days of the
canned variety. But this freshness made Cochrane realize
that he'd feel better for a bath.</p>

<p>He took a shower in his hotel room. The room was very
much like one on Earth, except that it had no windows.
But the shower was strange. The sprays were tiny. Cochrane
felt as if he were being sprayed by atomizers rather
than shower-nozzles until he noticed that water ran off him
very slowly and realized that a normal shower would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
been overwhelming. He scooped up a handful of water and
let it drop. It took a full second to fall two and a half feet.</p>

<p>It was unsettling, but fresh clothing from his waiting
baggage made him feel better. He went to the lounge of the
hotel, and it was not a lounge, and the hotel was not a hotel.
Everything in the dome was indoors in the sense that it was
under a globular ceiling fifty stories high. But everything
was also out-doors in the sense of bright light and growing
trees and bushes and shrubs.</p>

<p>He found Babs freshly garmented and waiting for him.
She said in <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'buisinesslike'.">businesslike</ins> tones:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cochrane, I asked at the desk. Doctor Holden has
gone to consult Mr. Dabney. He asked that we stay within
call. I've sent word to Mr. West and Mr. Jamison and Mr.
Bell."</p>

<p>Cochrane approved of her secretarial efficiency.</p>

<p>"Then we'll sit somewhere and wait. Since this isn't an
office, we'll find some refreshment."</p>

<p>They asked for a table and got one near the swimming
pool. And Babs wore her office manner, all crispness and
business, until they were seated. But this swimming pool
was not like a pool on Earth. The water was deeply sunk
beneath the pool's rim, and great waves surged back and
forth. The swimmers&mdash;.</p>

<p>Babs gasped. A man stood on a board quite thirty feet
above the water. He prepared to dive.</p>

<p>"That's Johnny Simms!" she said, awed.</p>

<p>"Who's he?"</p>

<p>"The playboy," said Babs, staring. "He's a psychopathic
personality and his family has millions. They keep him up
here out of trouble. He's married."</p>

<p>"Too bad&mdash;if he has millions," said Cochrane.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't marry a man with a psychopathic personality!"
protested Babs.</p>

<p>"Keep away from people in the advertising business,
then," Cochrane told her.</p>

<p>Johnny Simms did not jounce up and down on the diving
board to start. He simply leaped upward, and went
ceilingward for easily fifteen feet, and hung stationary for
a full breath, and then began to descend in literal slow
motion. He fell only two and a half feet the first second,
and five feet more the one after, and twelve and a half after
that.... It took him over four seconds to drop forty-five
feet into the water, and the splash that arose when he struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the surface rose four yards and subsided with a lunatic
deliberation.</p>

<p>Watching, Babs could not keep her businesslike demeanor.
She was bursting with the joyous knowledge that
she was on the moon, seeing the impossible and looking at
fame.</p>

<p>They sipped at drinks&mdash;but the liquid rose much too
swiftly in the straws&mdash;and Cochrane reflected that the drink
in Babs' glass would cost Dabney's father-in-law as much
as Babs earned in a week back home, and his own was
costing no less.</p>

<p>Presently a written note came from Holden:</p>

<p>"<i>Jed: send West and Jamison right away to Dabney's
lunar laboratory to get details of discovery from man named
Jones. Get moon-jeep and driver from hotel. I will want
you in an hour.&mdash;Bill.</i>"</p>

<p>"I'll be back," said Cochrane. "Wait."</p>

<p>He left the table and found West and Jamison in Bell's
room, all three in conference over a bottle. West and Jamison
were Cochrane's scientific team for the yet unformulated
task he was to perform. West was the popularizing
specialist. He could make a television audience believe
that it understood all the seven dimensions required for
some branches of wave-mechanics theory. His explanation
did not stick, of course. One didn't remember them. But
they were singularly convincing in cultural episodes on
television productions. Jamison was the prophecy expert.
He could extrapolate anything into anything else, and
make you believe that a one-week drop in the birthdate on
Kamchatka was the beginning of a trend that would leave
the Earth depopulated in exactly four hundred and seventy-three
years. They were good men for a television
producer to have on call. Now, instructed, they went out
to be briefed by somebody who undoubtedly knew more
than both of them put together, but whom they would regard
with tolerant suspicion.</p>

<p>Bell, left behind, said cagily:</p>

<p>"This script I've got to do, now&mdash;Will that laboratory
be the set? Where is it? In the dome?"</p>

<p>"It's not in the dome," Cochrane told him. "West and
Jamison took a moon-jeep to get to it. I don't know what
the set will be. I don't know anything, yet. I'm waiting to
be told about the job, myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I've got to cook up a story-line," observed Bell, "I
have to know the set. Who'll act? You know how amateurs
can ham up any script! How about a part for Babs? Nice
kid!"</p>

<p>Cochrane found himself annoyed, without knowing why.</p>

<p>"We just have to wait until we know what our job is,"
he said curtly, and turned to go.</p>

<p>Bell said:</p>

<p>"One more thing. If you're planning to use a news cameraman
up here&mdash;don't! I used to be a cameraman before
I got crazy and started to write. Let me do the camera-work.
I've got a better idea of using a camera to tell
a story now, than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold it," said Cochrane. "We're not up here to film-tape
a show. Our job is psychiatry&mdash;craziness."</p>

<p>To a self-respecting producer, a psychiatric production
would seem craziness. A script-writer might have trouble
writing out a psychiatrist's prescription, or he might not.
But producing it would be out of all rationality! No camera,
the patient would be the star, and most lines would be ad
libbed. Cochrane viewed such a production with extreme
distaste. But of course, if a man wanted only to be famous,
it might be handled as a straight public-relations job. In
any case, though, it would amount to flattery in three dimensions
and Cochrane would rather have no part in it.
But he had to arrange the whole thing.</p>

<p>He went back to the table and rejoined Babs. She confided
that she'd been talking to Johnny Simms' wife. She
was nice! But homesick. Cochrane sat down and thought
morbid thoughts. Then he realized that he was irritated
because Babs didn't notice. He finished his drink and
ordered another.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Holden found them. He had in tow
a sad-looking youngish man with a remarkably narrow
forehead and an expression of deep anxiety. Cochrane
winced. A neurotic type if there ever was one!</p>

<p>"Jed," said Holden heartily, "here's Mr. Dabney. Mr.
Dabney, Jed Cochrane is here as a specialist in public-relations
set-ups. He'll take charge of this affair. Your
father-in-law sent him up here to see that you are done
justice to!"</p>

<p>Dabney seemed to think earnestly before he spoke.</p>

<p>"It is not for myself," he explained in an anxious tone.
"It is my work! That is important! After all, this is a fundamental
scientific discovery! But nobody pays any attention!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
It is extremely important! Extremely! Science itself
is held back by the lack of attention paid to my discovery!"</p>

<p>"Which," Holden assured him, "is about to be changed.
It's a matter of public relations. Jed's a specialist. He'll
take over."</p>

<p>The sad-faced young man held up his hand for attention.
He thought. Visibly. Then he said worriedly:</p>

<p>"I would take you over to my laboratory, but I promised
my wife I would call her in half an hour from now.
Johnny Simms' wife just reminded me. My wife is back
on Earth. So you will have to go to the laboratory without
me and have Mr. Jones show you the proof of my work.
A very intelligent man, Jones&mdash;in a subordinate way, of
course. Yes. I will get you a jeep and you can go there at
once, and when you come back you can tell me what you
plan. But you understand that it is not for myself that I
want credit! It is my discovery! It is terribly important!
It is vital! It must not be overlooked!"</p>

<p>Holden escorted him away, while Cochrane carefully
controlled his features. After a few moments Holden came
back, his face sagging.</p>

<p>"This your drink, Jed?" he asked dispiritedly. "I need
it!" He picked up the glass and emptied it. "The history
of that case would be interesting, if one could really get
to the bottom of it! Come along!" His tone was dreariness
itself. "I've got a jeep waiting for us."</p>

<p>Babs stood up, her eyes shining.</p>

<p>"May I come, Mr. Cochrane?"</p>

<p>Cochrane waved her along. Holden tried to stalk gloomily,
but nobody can stalk in one-sixth gravity. He reeled,
and then depressedly accommodated himself to conditions
on the moon.</p>

<p>There was an airlock with a smaller edition of the
moon-jeep that had brought them from the ship to the
city. It was a brightly-polished metal body, raised some
ten feet off the ground on outrageously large wheels. It
was very similar to the straddle-trucks used in lumberyards
on Earth. It would straddle boulders in its path. It
could go anywhere in spite of dust and detritus, and its
metal body was air-tight and held air for breathing, even
out on the moon's surface.</p>

<p>They climbed in. There was the sound of pumping,
which grew fainter. The outer lock-door opened. The
moon-jeep rolled outside.</p>

<p>Babs stared with passionate rapture out of a shielded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
port. There were impossibly jagged stones, preposterously
steep cliffs. There had been no weather to remove the
sharp edge of anything in a hundred million years. The
awkward-seeming vehicle trundled over the lava sea toward
the rampart of mighty mountains towering over Lunar
City. It reached a steep ascent. It climbed. And the way
was remarkably rough and the vehicle springless, but it
was nevertheless a cushioned ride. A bump cannot be harsh
in light gravity. The vehicle rode as if on wings.</p>

<p>"All right," said Cochrane. "Tell me the worst. What's
the trouble with him? Is he the result of six generations of
keeping the money in the family? Or is he a freak?"</p>

<p>Holden groaned a little.</p>

<p>"He's practically a stock model of a rich young man
without brains enough for a job in the family firm, and too
much money for anything else. Fortunately for his family,
he didn't react like Johnny Simms&mdash;though they're good
friends. A hundred years ago, Dabney'd have gone in for
the arts. But it's hard to fool yourself that way now. Fifty
years ago he'd have gone in for left-wing sociology. But we
really are doing the best that can be done with too many
people and not enough world. So he went in for science.
It's non-competitive. Incapacity doesn't show up. But he
has stumbled on something. It sounds really important. It
must have been an accident! The only trouble is that it
doesn't mean a thing! Yet because he's accomplished more
than he ever expected to, he's frustrated because it's not
appreciated! What a joke!"</p>

<p>Cochrane said cynically:</p>

<p>"You paint a dark picture, Bill. Are you trying to make
this thing into a challenge?"</p>

<p>"You can't make a man famous for discovering something
that doesn't matter," said Holden hopelessly. "And
this is that!"</p>

<p>"Nothing's impossible to public relations if you spend
enough money," Cochrane assured him. "What's this useless
triumph of his?"</p>

<p>The jeep bounced over a small cliff and fell gently for
half a second and rolled on. Babs beamed.</p>

<p>"He's found," said Holden discouragedly, "a way to send
messages faster than light. It's a detour around Einstein's
stuff&mdash;not denying it, but evading it. Right now it takes not
quite two seconds for a message to go from the moon to
Earth. That's at the speed of light. Dabney has proof&mdash;we'll
see it&mdash;that he can cut that down some ninety-five per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
cent. Only it can't be used for Earth-moon communication,
because both ends have to be in a vacuum. It could be
used to the space platform, but&mdash;what's the difference? It's
a real discovery for which there's no possible use. There's
no place to send messages to!"</p>

<p>Cochrane's eyes grew bright and hard. There were some
three thousand million suns in the immediate locality of
Earth&mdash;and more only a relatively short distance way&mdash;and
it had not mattered to anybody. The situation did not seem
likely to change. But&mdash;The moon-jeep climbed and
climbed. It was a mile above the bay of the lava sea and the
dust-heaps that were a city. It looked like ten miles, because
of the curve of the horizon. The mountains all about looked
like a madman's dream.</p>

<p>"But he wants appreciation!" said Holden angrily. "People
on Earth almost trampling on each other for lack of
room, and people like me trying to keep them sane when
they've every reason for despair&mdash;and he wants appreciation!"</p>

<p>Cochrane grinned. He whistled softly.</p>

<p>"Never underestimate a genius, Bill," he said kindly. "I
refer modestly to myself. In two weeks your patient&mdash;I'll
guarantee it&mdash;will be acclaimed the hope, the blessing, the
greatest man in all the history of humanity! It'll be phoney,
of course, but we'll have Marilyn Winters&mdash;Little Aphrodite
herself&mdash;making passes at him in hopes of a publicity
break! It's a natural!"</p>

<p>"How'll you do it?" demanded Holden.</p>

<p>The moon-jeep turned in its crazy, bumping progress. A
flat area had been blasted in rock which had been unchanged
since the beginning of time. Here there was a human
structure. Typically, it was a dust-heap leaning against
a cliff. There was an airlock and another jeep waited outside,
and there were eccentric metal devices on the flat
space, shielded from direct sunshine and with cables running
to them from the airlock door.</p>

<p>"How?" repeated Cochrane. "I'll get the details here.
Let's go! How do we manage?"</p>

<p>It was a matter, he discovered, of vacuum-suits, and they
were tricky to get into and felt horrible when one was in.
Struggling, Cochrane thought to say:</p>

<p>"You can wait here in the jeep, Babs&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she was already climbing into a suit very much
oversized for her, with the look of high excitement that
Cochrane had forgotten anybody could wear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>They got out of a tiny airlock that held just one person
at a time. They started for the laboratory. And suddenly
Cochrane saw Babs staring upward through the dark, almost-opaque
glass that a space-suit-helmet needs in the
moon's daytime if its occupant isn't to be fried by sunlight.
Cochrane automatically glanced up too.</p>

<p>He saw Earth. It hung almost in mid-sky. It was huge.
It was gigantic. It was colossal. It was four times the diameter
of the moon as seen from Earth, and it covered sixteen
times as much of the sky. Its continents were plain to
see, and its seas, and the ice-caps at its poles gleamed
whitely, and over all of it there was a faintly bluish haze
which was like a glamour; a fey and eerie veiling which
made Earth a sight to draw at one's heart-strings.</p>

<p>Behind it and all about it there was the background of
space, so thickly jeweled with stars that there seemed no
room for another tiny gem.</p>

<p>Cochrane looked. He said nothing. Holden stumbled on
to the airlock. He remembered to hold the door open for
Babs.</p>

<p>And then there was the interior of the laboratory. It was
not wholly familiar even to Cochrane, who had used sets
on the Dikkipatti Hour of most of the locations in which
human dramas can unfold. This was a physics laboratory,
pure and simple. The air smelled of ozone and spilled acid
and oil and food and tobacco-smoke and other items. West
and Jamison were already here, their space-suits removed.
They sat before beer at a table with innumerable diagrams
scattered about. There was a deep-browed man rather impatiently
turning to face his new visitors.</p>

<p>Holden clumsily unfastened the face-plate of his helmet
and gloomily explained his mission. He introduced Cochrane
and Babs, verifying in the process that the dark man
was the Jones he had come to see. A physics laboratory
high in the fastnesses of the Lunar <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'Appenines'.">Apennines</ins> is an odd
place for a psychiatrist to introduce himself on professional
business. But Holden only explained unhappily that Dabney
had sent them to learn about his discovery and arrange
for a public-relations job to make it known.</p>

<p>Cochrane saw Jones' expression flicker sarcastically just
once during Holden's explanation. Otherwise he was poker-faced.</p>

<p>"I was explaining the discovery to these two," he observed.</p>

<p>"Shoot it," said Cochrane to West. It was reasonable to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
ask West for an explanation, because he would translate
everything into televisable terms.</p>

<p>West said briskly&mdash;exactly as if before a television camera&mdash;that
Mr. Dabney had started from the well-known
fact that the properties of space are modified by energy
fields. Magnetic and gravitational and electrostatic fields rotate
polarized light or bend light or do this or that as the
case may be. But all previous modifications of the constants
of space had been in essentially spherical fields. All previous
fields had extended in all directions, increasing in
intensity as the square of the distance ...</p>

<p>"Cut," said Cochrane.</p>

<p>West automatically abandoned his professional delivery.
He placidly re-addressed himself to his beer.</p>

<p>"How about it, Jones?" asked Cochrane. "Dabney's got
a variation? What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a field of force that doesn't spread out. You set up
two plates and establish this field between them," said Jones
curtly. "It's circularly polarized and it doesn't expand. It's
like a searchlight beam or a microwave beam, and it stays
the same size like a pipe. In that field&mdash;or pipe&mdash;radiation
travels faster than it does outside. The properties of space
are changed between the plates. Therefore the speed of all
radiation. That's all."</p>

<p>Cochrane meditatively seated himself. He approved of
this Jones, whose eyebrows practically met in the middle of
his forehead. He was not more polite than politeness required.
He did not express employer-like rapture at the
mention of his employer's name.</p>

<p>"But what can be done with it?" asked Cochrane practically.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Jones succinctly. "It changes the properties
of space, but that's all. Can you think of any use for
a faster-than-light radiation-pipe? I can't."</p>

<p>Cochrane cocked an eye at Jamison, who could extrapolate
at the drop of an equation. But Jamison shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Communication between planets," he said morosely,
"when we get to them. Chats between sweethearts on Earth
and Pluto. Broadcasts to the stars when we find that another
one's set up a similar plate and is ready to chat with
us. There's nothing else."</p>

<p>Cochrane waved his hand. It is good policy to put a
specialist in his place, occasionally.</p>

<p>"Demonstration?" he asked Jones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are plates across the crater out yonder," said
Jones without emotion. "Twenty miles clear reach. I can
send a message across and get it relayed twice and back
through two angles in about five per cent of the time radiation
ought to take."</p>

<p>Cochrane said with benign cynicism:</p>

<p>"Jamison, you work by guessing where you can go. Jones
works by guessing where he is. But this is a public relations
job. I don't know where we are or where we can go,
but I know where we want to take this thing."</p>

<p>Jones looked at him. Not hostilely, but with the detached
interest of a man accustomed to nearly exact science,
when he watches somebody work in one of the least precise
of them all.</p>

<p>Holden said:</p>

<p>"You mean you've worked out some sort of production."</p>

<p>"No production," said Cochrane blandly. "It isn't necessary.
A straight public-relations set-up. We concoct a
story and then let it leak out. We make it so good that
even the people who don't believe it can't help spreading
it." He nodded at Jamison. "Right now, Jamison, we want
a theory that the sending of radiation at twenty times the
speed of light means that there is a way to send matter
faster than light&mdash;as soon as we work it out. It means that
the inertia-mass which increases with speed&mdash;Einstein's
stuff&mdash;is not a property of matter, but of space, just as
the air-resistance that increases when an airplane goes
faster is a property of air and not of the plane. Maybe we
need to work out a theory that all inertia is a property of
space. We'll see if we need that. But anyhow, just as a
plane can go faster in thin air, so matter&mdash;any matter&mdash;will
move faster in this field as soon as we get the trick of
it. You see?"</p>

<p>Holden shook his head.</p>

<p>"What's that got in it to make Dabney famous?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Jamison will extrapolate from there," Cochrane assured
him. "Go ahead, Jamison. You're on."</p>

<p>Jamison said promptly, with the hypnotic smoothness
of the practiced professional:</p>

<p>"When this development has been completed, not only
will messages be sent at multiples of the speed of light, but
matter! Ships! The barrier to the high destiny of mankind;
the limitation of our race to a single planet of a minor sun&mdash;these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
handicaps crash and will shatter as the great
minds of humanity bend their efforts to make the Dabney
faster-than-light principle the operative principle of our
ships. There are thousands of millions of suns in our galaxy,
and not less than one in three has planets, and among
these myriads of unknown worlds there will be thousands
with seas and land and clouds and continents, fit for men
to enter upon, there to rear their cities. There will be starships
roaming distant sun-clusters, and landing on planets
in the Milky Way. We ourselves will see freight-lines to
Rigel and <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'Arcturis'.">Arcturus</ins>, and journey on passenger-liners singing
through the void to Andromeda and Aldebaran! Dabney
has made the first breach in the barrier to the illimitable
greatness of humanity!"</p>

<p>Then he stopped and said professionally:</p>

<p>"I can polish that up a bit, of course. All right?"</p>

<p>"Fair," conceded Cochrane. He turned to Holden.
"How about a public-relations job on that order? Won't
that sort of publicity meet the requirements? Will your
patient be satisfied with that grade of appreciation?"</p>

<p>Holden drew a deep breath. He said unsteadily:</p>

<p>"As a neurotic personality, he won't require that it be
true. All he'll want is the seeming. But&mdash;Jed, could it be
really true? Could it?"</p>

<p>Cochrane laughed unpleasantly. He did not admire himself.
His laughter showed it.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he demanded. "You got me a
job I didn't want. You shoved it down my throat! Now
there's the way to get it done! What more can you ask?"</p>

<p>Holden winced. Then he said heavily:</p>

<p>"I'd like for it to be true."</p>

<p>Jones moved suddenly. He said in an oddly surprised
voice:</p>

<p>"D'you know, it can be! I didn't realize! It can be true!
I can make a ship go faster than light!"</p>

<p>Cochrane said with exquisite irony:</p>

<p>"Thanks, but we don't need it. We aren't getting paid
for that! All we need is a modicum of appreciation for a
neurotic son-in-law of a partner of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins
and Fallowe! A public-relations job is all that's required.
You give West the theory, and Jamison will do the
prophecy, and Bell will write it out."</p>

<p>Jones said calmly:</p>

<p>"I will like hell! Look! I discovered this faster-than-light
field in the first place! I sold it to Dabney because he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
wanted to be famous! I got my pay and he can keep it!
But if he can't understand it himself, even to lecture about
it ... Do you think I'm going to throw in some extra
stuff I noticed, that I can fit into that theory but nobody
else can&mdash;Do you think I'm going to give him starships as
a bonus?"</p>

<p>Holden said, nodding, with his lips twisted:</p>

<p>"I should have figured that! He bought his great discovery
from you, eh? And that's what he gets frustrated about!"</p>

<p>Cochrane snapped:</p>

<p>"I thought you psychiatrists knew the facts of life, Bill!
Dabney's not unusual in my business! He's almost a typical sponsor!"</p>

<p>"When you ask me to throw away starships," said Jones
coldly, "for a publicity feature, I don't play. I won't take
the credit for the field away from Dabney. I sold him that
with my eyes open. But starships are more important than
a fool's hankering to be famous! He'd never try it! He'd
be afraid it wouldn't work! I don't play!"</p>

<p>Holden said stridently:</p>

<p>"I don't give a damn about any deal you made with Dabney!
But if you can get us to the stars&mdash;all us humans who
need it&mdash;you've got to!"</p>

<p>Jones said, again calmly:</p>

<p>"I'm willing. Make me an offer&mdash;not cash, but a chance
to do something real&mdash;not just a trick for a neurotic's ego!"</p>

<p>Cochrane grinned at him very peculiarly.</p>

<p>"I like your approach. You've got illusions. They're nice
things to have. I wouldn't mind having some myself. Bill,"
he said to Dr. William Holden, "how much nerve has Dabney?"</p>

<p>"Speaking unprofessionally," said Holden, "he's a worm
with wants. He hasn't anything but cravings. <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original lacked the closing quote mark.">Why?"</ins></p>

<p>Cochrane grinned again, his head cocked on one side.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't take part in an enterprise to reach the
stars, would he?" When Holden shook his head, Cochrane
said zestfully, "I'd guess that the peak of his ambition
would be to have the credit for it if it worked, but he
wouldn't risk being associated with it until it had worked!
Right?"</p>

<p>"Right," said Holden. "I said he was a worm. What're
you driving at?"</p>

<p>"I'm outlining what you're twisting my arm to make me
do," said Cochrane, "in case you haven't noticed. Bill, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Jones can really make a ship go faster than light&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can," repeated Jones. "I simply didn't think of the
thing in connection with travel. I only thought of it for
signalling."</p>

<p>"Then," said Cochrane, "I'm literally forced, for Dabney's
sake, to do something that he'd scream shrilly at if
he heard about it. We're going to have a party, Bill! A
party after your and my and Jones' hearts!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Holden.</p>

<p>"We make a production after all," said Cochrane, grinning.
"We are going to take Dabney's discovery&mdash;the one
he bought publicity rights to&mdash;very seriously indeed. I'm
going to get him acclaim. First we break a story of what
Dabney's field means for the future of mankind&mdash;and then
we prove it! We take a journey to the stars! Want to make
your reservations now?"</p>

<p>"You mean," said West incredulously, "a genuine trip?
Why?"</p>

<p>Cochrane snapped at him suddenly.</p>

<p>"Because I can't kid myself any more," he rasped. "I've
found out how little I count in the world and the estimation
of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe! I've found
out I'm only a little man when I thought I was a big one,
and I won't take it! Now I've got an excuse to try to be a
big man! That's reason enough, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Then he glared around the small laboratory under the
dust-heap. He was irritated because he did not feel splendid
emotions after making a resolution and a plan which
ought to go down in history&mdash;if it worked. He wasn't uplifted.
He wasn't aware of any particular feeling of being
the instrument of destiny or anything else. He simply felt
peevish and annoyed and obstinate about trying the impossible
trick.</p>

<p>It annoyed him additionally, perhaps, to see the expression
of starry-eyed admiration on Babs' face as she
looked at him across the untidy laboratory table, cluttered
up with beer-cans.</p>

<p>It is a matter of record that the American continents
were discovered because ice-boxes were unknown
in the fifteenth century. There being no refrigeration, meat
did not keep. But meat was not too easy to come by, so
it had to be eaten, even when it stank. Therefore it was
a noble enterprise, and to the glory of the kingdoms of
Castile and Aragon, to put up the financial backing for
even a crackpot who might get spices cheaper and thereby
make the consumption of slightly spoiled meat less unpleasant.
Which was why Columbus got three ships and
crews of jailbirds for them from a government still busy
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'tryin'.">trying</ins> to drive the Moors out of the last corner of Spain.</p>

<p>This was a precedent for the matter on hand now. Cochrane
happened to know the details about Columbus because
he'd checked over the research when he did a show
on the Dikkipatti Hour dealing with him. There were more
precedents. The elaborate bargain by which Columbus
was to be made hereditary High Admiral of the Western
Oceans, with a bite of all revenue obtained by the passage
he was to discover&mdash;he had to hold out for such terms to
make the package he was selling look attractive. Nobody
buys anything that is underpriced too much. It looks phoney.
So Cochrane made his preliminaries rather more impressive
than they need have been from a strictly practical
point of view, in order to make the enterprise practical
from a financial aspect.</p>

<p>There was another precedent he did not intend to follow.
Columbus did not know where he was going when he
set sail, he did not know where he was when he arrived at
the end of his voyage, and he didn't know where he'd been
when he got back. Cochrane expected to improve on the
achievement of the earlier explorer's doings in these respects.</p>

<p>He commandeered the legal department of Kursten,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Kasten, Hopkins, and Fallowe to set up the enterprise with
strict legality and discretion. There came into being a corporation
called "Spaceways, Inc." which could not possibly
be considered phoney from any inspection of its
charter. Expert legal advice arranged that its actual stock-holders
should appear to be untraceable. Deft manipulation
contrived that though its stock was legally vested in
Cochrane and Holden and Jones&mdash;Cochrane negligently
threw in Jones as a convenient name to use&mdash;and they
were officially the owners of nearly all the stock, nobody
who checked up would believe they were anything but
dummies. Stockholdings in West's, and Jamison's and
Bell's names would look like smaller holdings held for
other than the main entrepreneurs. But these <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphenated to correspond with other usage in text.">stock-holders</ins>
were not only the legal owners of record&mdash;they were the
true owners. Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe wanted
no actual part of Spaceways. They considered the enterprise
merely a psychiatric treatment for a neurotic son-in-law.
Which, of course, it was. So Spaceways, Inc., quite
honestly and validly belonged to the people who would
cure Dabney of his frustration&mdash;and nobody at all believed
that it would ever do anything else. Not anybody
but those six owners, anyhow. And as it turned out, not
all of them.</p>

<p>The psychiatric treatment began with an innocent-seeming
news-item from Lunar City saying that Dabney, the
so-and-so scientist, had consented to act as consulting
physicist to Spaceways, Inc., for the practical application
of his recent discovery of a way to send messages faster
than light.</p>

<p>This was news simply because it came from the moon.
It got fairly wide distribution, but no emphasis.</p>

<p>Then the publicity campaign broke. On orders from
Cochrane, Jamison the extrapolating genius got slightly
plastered, in company with the two news-association reporters
in Lunar City. He confided that Spaceways, Inc.,
had been organized and was backed to develop the Dabney
faster-than-light-signalling field into a faster-than-light-travel
field. The news men pumped him of all his
extrapolations. Cynically, they checked to see who might
be preparing to unload stock. They found no preparations
for stock-sales. No registration of the company for raising
funds. It wasn't going to the public for money. It wasn't
selling anybody anything. Then Cochrane refused to see
any reporters at all, everybody connected with the enterprise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
shut up tighter than a clam, and Jamison vanished
into a hotel room where he was kept occupied with beverages
and food at Dabney's father-in-law's expense. None
of this was standard for a phoney promotion deal.</p>

<p>The news story exploded. Let loose on an overcrowded
planet which had lost all hope of relief after fifty years in
which only the moon had been colonized&mdash;and its colony
had a population in the hundreds, only&mdash;the idea of faster-than-light
travel was the one impossible dream that everybody
wanted to believe in. The story spread in a manner
that could only be described as chain-reaction in character.
And of course Dabney&mdash;as the scientist responsible for the
new hope&mdash;became known to all peoples.</p>

<p>The experts of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe
checked on the publicity given to Dabney. Strict advertising
agency accounting figured that to date the cost-per-customer-mention
of Dabney and his discovery were the
lowest in the history of advertising. Surveys disclosed that
within three Earth-days less than 3.5 of every hundred
interviews questioned were completely ignorant of Dabney
and the prospect of travel to the stars through his discovery.
More people knew Dabney's name than knew the
name of the President of the United States!</p>

<p>That was only the beginning. The leading popular-science
show jumped eight points in audience-rating. It
actually reached top-twenty rating when it assigned a regular
five-minute period to the Dabney Field and its <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'possiblities'.">possibilities</ins>
in human terms. On the sixth day after Jamison's
calculated indiscretion, the public consciousness was literally
saturated with the idea of faster-than-light transportation.
Dabney was mentioned in every interview of every
stuffed shirt, he was referred to on every comedy show
(three separate jokes had been invented, which were developed
into one thousand eight hundred switcheroos, most
of them only imperceptibly different from the original
trio) and even Marilyn Winters&mdash;Little Aphrodite Herself&mdash;was
demanding a faster-than-light-travel sequence in
her next television show.</p>

<p>On the seventh day Bill Holden came into the office
where Cochrane worked feverishly.</p>

<p>"Doctor Cochrane," said Holden, "a word with you!"</p>

<p>"Doctor?" asked Cochrane.</p>

<p>"Doctor!" repeated Holden. "I've just been interviewing
my patient. You're good. My patient is adjusted."</p>

<p>Cochrane raised his eyebrows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's famous," said Holden grimly. "He now considers
that everybody in the world knows that he is a great
scientist. He is appreciated. He is happily making plans to
go back to Earth and address a few learned societies and
let people admire him. He can now spend the rest of his
life being the man who discovered the principle by which
faster-than-light-travel will some day be achieved. Even
when the furor dies down, he will have been a great man&mdash;and
he will stay a great man in his own estimation. In
short, he's cured."</p>

<p>Cochrane grinned.</p>

<p>"Then I'm fired?"</p>

<p>"We are," said Holden. "There are professional ethics
even among psychiatrists, Jed. I have to admit that the guy
now has a permanent adjustment to reality. He has been
recognized as a great scientist. He is no longer frustrated."</p>

<p>Cochrane leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"That may be good medical ethics," he observed, "but
it's lousy business practice, Bill. You say he's adjusted to
reality. That means that he will now have a socially acceptable
reaction to anything that's likely to happen to
him."</p>

<p>Holden nodded.</p>

<p>"A well-adjusted person does. Dabney's the same person.
He's the same fool. But he'll get along all right. A
psychiatrist can't change a personality! All he can do is
make it adjust to the world about so the guy doesn't have
to be tucked away in a straight-jacket. In that sense, Dabney
is adjusted."</p>

<p>"You've played a dirty trick on him," said Cochrane.
"You've stabilized him, and that's the rottenest trick anybody
can play on anybody! You've put him into a sort of
moral deep-freeze. It's a dirty trick, Bill!"</p>

<p>"Look who's talking!" said Holden wearily. "I suppose
the advertising business is altruistic and unmercenary?"</p>

<p>"The devil, no!" said Cochrane indignantly. "We serve
a useful purpose! We tell people that they smell bad, and
so give them an alibi for the unpopularity their stupidity
has produced. But then we tell them to use so-and-so's
breath sweetener or whosit's non-immunizing deodorant
they'll immediately become the life of every party they attend!
It's a lie, of course, but it's a dynamic lie! It gives
the frustrated individual something to do! It sells him
hope and therefore activity&mdash;and inactivity is a sort of
death!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Holden looked at Cochrane with a dreary disinterest.</p>

<p>"You're adjusted, Jed! But do you really believe that
stuff?"</p>

<p>Cochrane grinned again.</p>

<p>"Only on Tuesdays and Fridays. It's about two-sevenths
true. But it does have that much truth in it! Nobody ever
gets anything done while they merely make socially acceptable
responses to the things that happen to them!
Take Dabney himself! We've got a hell of a thing coming
along now just because he wouldn't make the socially
acceptable response to having a rich wife and no brains.
He rebelled. So mankind will start moving to the stars!"</p>

<p>"You still believe it?"</p>

<p>Cochrane grimaced.</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning I sweated blood in a space-suit out
in the crater beyond Jones' laboratory. He tried his trick.
He had a small signal-rocket mounted on the far side of
that crater,&mdash;twenty-some miles. It was in front of the
field-plate that established the Dabney field across the crater
to another plate near us. Jones turned on the field. He
ignited the rocket by remote control. I was watching with
a telescope. I gave him the word to fire.... How long do
you think it took that rocket to cross the crater in that field
that works like a pipe? It smashed into the plate at the
lab!"</p>

<p>Holden shook his head.</p>

<p>"It took slightly," said Cochrane, "slightly under three-fifths
of a second."</p>

<p>Holden blinked. Cochrane said:</p>

<p>"A signal-rocket has an acceleration of about six hundred
feet per second, level flight, no gravity component,
mass acceleration only. It should have taken a hundred
seconds plus to cross that crater&mdash;over twenty miles. It
shouldn't have stayed on course. It did stay on course, inside
the field. It did take under three-fifths of a second.
The gadget works!"</p>

<p>Holden drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"So now you need more money and you want me not to
discharge my patient as cured."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" snapped Cochrane. "I don't want him
as a patient! I'm only willing to accept him as a customer!
But if he wants fame, I'll sell it to him. Not as something
to lean his fragile psyche on, but something to wallow in!
Do you think he could ever get too famous for his own
satisfaction?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not," said Holden. "He's the same fool."</p>

<p>"Then we're in business," Cochrane told him. "Not
that I couldn't peddle my fish elsewhere. I'm going to! But
I'll give him old-customer preference. I'll want him out at
the distress-torp tests this afternoon. They'll be public."</p>

<p>"This afternoon?" asked Holden. "Distress-torp?"</p>

<p>A lunar day is two Earth-weeks-long. A lunar night is
equally long-drawn-out. Cochrane said impatiently:</p>

<p>"I got out of bed four hours ago. To me that's morning.
I'll eat lunch in an hour. That's noon. Say, three hours
from now, whatever o'clock it is lunar time."</p>

<p>Holden glanced at his watch and made computations.
He said:</p>

<p>"That'll be half-past two hundred and three o'clock, if
you're curious. But what's a distress-torp?"</p>

<p>"Shoo!" said Cochrane. "I'll send Babs to find you and
load you on the jeep. You'll see then. Now I'm busy!"</p>

<p>Holden shrugged and went away, and Cochrane stared
at his own watch. Since a lunar day and night together
fill twenty-eight Earth days of time, a strictly lunar "day"
contains nearly three hundred forty Earth-hours. To call
one-twelfth of that period an hour would be an affectation.
To call each twenty-four Earth hours a day would have
been absurd. So the actual period of the moon's rotation
was divided into familiar time-intervals, and a bulletin-board
in the hotel lobby in Lunar City notified those interested
that: "<i>Sunday will be from 143 o'clock to 167
o'clock A.M.</i>" There would be another Sunday some time
during the lunar afternoon.</p>

<p>Cochrane debated momentarily whether this information
could be used in the publicity campaign of Spaceways,
Inc. Strictly speaking, there was some slight obligation
to throw extra fame Dabney's way regardless, because
the corporation had been formed as a public-relations
device. Any other features, such as changing the history
of the human race, were technically incidental. But Cochrane
put his watch away. To talk about horology on the
moon wouldn't add to Dabney's stature as a phoney scientist.
It didn't matter.</p>

<p>He went back to the business at hand. Some two years
before there had been a fake corporation organized strictly
for the benefit of its promoters. It had built a rocket-ship
ostensibly for the establishment of a colony on Mars. The
ship had managed to stagger up to Luna, but no farther. Its
promoters had sold stock on the promise that a ship that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
could barely reach Luna could take off from that small
globe with six times as much fuel as it could lift off of
Earth. Which was true. Investors put in their money on that
verifiable fact. But the truth happened to be, of course,
that it would still take an impossible amount of fuel to
accelerate the ship&mdash;so heavily loaded&mdash;to a speed where
it would reach Mars in one human lifetime. Taking off
from Luna would solve only the problem of gravity. It
wouldn't do a thing about inertia. So the ship never rose
from its landing near Lunar City. The corporation that
had built it went profitably bankrupt.</p>

<p>Cochrane had been working feverishly to find out who
owned that ship now. Just before the torp-test he'd mentioned,
he found that the ship belonged to the hotel desk-clerk,
who had bought it in hope of renting it sooner or
later for television background-shots in case anybody was
crazy enough to make a television film-tape on the moon.
He was now discouraged. Cochrane chartered it, putting
up a bond to return it undamaged. If the ship was lost, the
hotel-clerk would get back his investment&mdash;about a week's
pay.</p>

<p>So Cochrane had a space-ship practically in his pocket
when the public demonstration of the Dabney field came
off at half-past 203 o'clock.</p>

<p>The site of the demonstration was the shadowed, pitch-dark
part of the floor of a crater twenty miles across, with
walls some ten thousand jagged feet high. The furnace-like
sunshine made the plain beyond the shadow into a sea of
blinding brightness. The sunlit parts of the crater's walls
were no less terribly glaring. But above the edge of the cliffs
the stars began; infinitely small and many-colored, with innumerable
degrees of brightness. The Earth hung in mid-sky
like a swollen green apple, monstrous in size. And the
figures which moved about the scene of the test could be
seen only faintly by reflected light from the lava plain, because
one's eyes had to be adjusted to the white-hot moon-dust
on the plain and mountains.</p>

<p>There were not many persons present. Three jeeps
waited in the semi-darkness, out of the burning sunshine.
There were no more than a dozen moon-suited individuals
to watch and to perform the test of the Dabney field. Cochrane
had scrupulously edited all fore-news of the experiment
to give Dabney the credit he had paid for. There
were present, then, the party from Earth&mdash;Cochrane and
Babs and Holden, with the two tame scientists and Bell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the writer&mdash;and the only two reporters on the moon. Only
news syndicates could stand the expense-account of a field
man in Lunar City. And then there were Jones and Dabney
and two other figures apparently brought by Dabney.</p>

<p>There was, of course, no sound at all on the moon itself.
There was no air to carry it. But from each plastic helmet
a six-inch antenna projected straight upward, and the
microwaves of suit-talkies made a jumble of slightly metallic
sounds in the headphones of each suit.</p>

<p>As soon as Cochrane got out of the jeep's air-lock and
was recognized, Dabney said agitatedly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cochrane! Mr. Cochrane! I have to discuss something
with you! It is of the utmost importance! Will you
come into the laboratory?"</p>

<p>Cochrane helped Babs to the ground and made his way
to the airlock in the dust-heap against the cliff. He went in,
with two other space-suited figures who detached themselves
from the rest to follow him. Once inside the odorous,
cramped laboratory, Dabney opened his face-plate and began
to speak before Cochrane was ready to hear him. His
companion beamed amiably.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and therefore, Mr. Cochrane," Dabney was saying
agitatedly, "I insist that measures be taken to protect my
scientific reputation! If this test should fail, it will militate
against the acceptance of my discovery! I warn you&mdash;and
I have my friend Mr. Simms here as witness&mdash;that I will not
be responsible for the operation of apparatus made by a
subordinate who does not fully comprehend the theory of
my discovery! I will not be involved&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cochrane nodded. Dabney, of course, didn't understand
the theory of the field he'd bought fame-rights to. But there
was no point in bringing that up. Johnny Simms beamed
at both of them. He was the swimmer Babs had pointed
out in the swimming-pool. His face was completely unlined
and placid, like the face of a college undergraduate. He
had never worried about anything. He'd never had a care
in the world. He merely listened with placid interest.</p>

<p>"I take it," said Cochrane, "that you don't mind the
test being made, so long as you don't have to accept responsibility
for its failure&mdash;and so long as you get the credit
for its success if it works. That's right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"If it fails, I am not responsible!" insisted Dabney
stridently. "If it succeeds, it will be because of my discovery."</p>

<p>Cochrane sighed a little. This was a shabby business,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
but Dabney would have convinced himself, by now, that
he was the genius he wanted people to believe him.</p>

<p>"Before the test," said Cochrane gently, "you make a
speech. It will be recorded. You disclaim the crass and
vulgar mechanical details and emphasize that you are like
Einstein, dealing in theoretic physics only. That you are
naturally interested in attempts to use your discovery, but
your presence is a sign of your interest but not your responsibility."</p>

<p>"I shall have to think it over&mdash;," began Dabney nervously.</p>

<p>"You can say," promised Cochrane, "that if it does not
work you will check over what Jones did and tell him why."</p>

<p>"Y-yes," said Dabney hesitantly, "I could do that. But
I must think it over first. You will have to delay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I were you," said Cochrane confidentially, "I would
plan a speech to that effect because the test is coming off
in five minutes."</p>

<p>He closed his face-plate as Dabney began to protest.
He went into the lock. He knew better than to hold anything
up while waiting for a neurotic to make a decision.
Dabney had all he wanted, now. From this moment on he
would be frantic for fear of losing it. But there could be
no argument outside the laboratory. In the airlessness, anything
anybody said by walkie-talkie could be heard by
everybody.</p>

<p>When Dabney and Simms followed out of the lock,
Cochrane was helping Jones set up the device that had been
prepared for this test. It was really two devices. One was
a very flat cone, much like a coolie-hat and hardly larger,
with a sort of power-pack of coils and batteries attached.
The other was a space-ship's distress-signal rocket, designed
to make a twenty-mile streak of red flame in emptiness.
Nobody had yet figured out what good a distress
signal would do, between Earth and moon, but the idea
was soothing. The rocket was four feet long and six inches
in diameter. At its nose there was a second coolie-hat
cone, with other coils and batteries.</p>

<p>Jones set the separate cone on the ground and packed
stones around and under it to brace it. His movements
were almost ridiculously deliberate. Bending over, he bent
slowly, or the motion would lift his feet off the ground.
Straightening up, he straightened slowly, or the upward
impetus of his trunk would again lift him beyond contact
with solidity. But he braced the flat cone carefully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>He set the signal-torpedo over that cone. The entire
set-up was under six feet tall, and the coolie-hat cones
were no more than eighteen inches in diameter. He said
flatly:</p>

<p>"I'm all ready."</p>

<p>The hand and arm of a space-suited figure lifted, for
attention. Dabney's voice came worriedly from the headphones
of every suit:</p>

<p>"I wish it understood," he said in some agitation, "that
this first attempted application of my discovery is made
with my consent, but that I am not aware of the mechanical
details. As a scientist, my work has been in pure science. I
have worked for the advancement of human knowledge,
but the technological applications of my discovery are not
mine. Still&mdash;if this device does not work, I will take time
from my more important researches to inquire into what
part of my discovery has been inadequately understood
and applied. It may be that present technology is not
qualified to apply my discovery&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jones said without emotion&mdash;but Cochrane could imagine
his poker-faced expression inside his helmet:</p>

<p>"That's right. I consulted Mr. Dabney about the principles,
but the apparatus is my doing, I take the responsibility
for that!"</p>

<p>Then Cochrane added with pleasant irony:</p>

<p>"Since all this is recorded, Mr. Dabney can enlarge upon
his disinterest later. Right now, we can go ahead. Mr.
Dabney disavows us unless we are successful. Let us let it
go at that." Then he said: "The observatory's set to
track?"</p>

<p>A muffled voice said boredly, by short-wave from the observatory
up on the crater's rim:</p>

<p>"<i>We're ready. Visual and records, and we've got the
timers set to clock the auto-beacon signals as they come
in.</i>"</p>

<p>The voice was not enthusiastic. Cochrane had had to
put up his own money to have the nearside lunar observatory
put a low-power telescope to watch the rocket's
flight. In theory, this distress-rocket should make a twenty-mile
streak of relatively long-burning red sparks. A tiny
auto-beacon in its nose was set to send microwave signals
at ten-second intervals. On the face of it, it had looked
like a rather futile performance.</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Cochrane.</p>

<p>He noted with surprise that his mouth was suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
dry. This affair was out of all reason. A producer of television
shows should not be the person to discover in an
abstruse scientific development the way to reach the stars.
A neurotic son-in-law of an advertising tycoon should not
be the instrument by which the discovery should come
about. A psychiatrist should not be the means of associating
Jones&mdash;a very junior physicist with no money&mdash;and
Cochrane and the things Cochrane was prepared to bring
about if only this unlikely-looking gadget worked.</p>

<p>"Jones," said Cochrane with a little difficulty, "let's follow
an ancient tradition. Let Babs christen the enterprise
by throwing the switch."</p>

<p>Jones pointed there in the shadow of the crater-wall,
and Babs moved to the switch he indicated. She said
absorbedly:</p>

<p>"Five, four, three, two, one&mdash;"</p>

<p>She threw the switch. There was a spout of lurid red
flame.</p>

<p>The rocket vanished.</p>

<p>It vanished. It did not rise, visibly. It simply went away
from where it was, with all the abruptness of a light going
out. There was a flurry of the most brilliant imaginable carmine
flame. That light remained. But the rocket did not
so much rise as disappear.</p>

<p>Cochrane jerked his head up. He was close to the line
of the rocket's ascent. He could see a trail of red sparks
which stretched to invisibility. It was an extraordinarily thin
line. The separate flecks of crimson light which comprised
it were distant in space. They were so far from each other
that the signal-rocket was a complete failure as a device
making a streak of light that should be visible.</p>

<p>The muffled voice in the helmet-phones said blankly:</p>

<p>"<i>Hey! What'd you do to that rocket?</i>"</p>

<p>The others did not move. They seemed stunned. The
vanishing of the rocket was no way for a rocket to act. In
all expectation, it should have soared skyward with a
reasonable velocity, and should have accelerated rather
more swiftly from the moon's surface than it would have
done from Earth. But it should have remained visible
during all its flight. Its trail should have been a thick red
line. Instead, the red sparks were so far separated&mdash;the
trail was so attenuated that it was visible only from a spot
near its base. The observatory voice said more blankly still:</p>

<p>"<i>Hey! I've picked up the trail! I can't see it nearby,
but it seems to start, thin, about fifty miles up and go on</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
<i>away from there! That rocket shouldn't ha' gone more than
twenty miles! What happened?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Watch for the microwave signals</i>," said Jones' voice in
Cochrane's headphones.</p>

<p>The voice from the observatory squeaked suddenly. This
was not one of the highly-placed astronomers, but part of
the mechanical staff who'd been willing to do an unreasonable
chore for pay.</p>

<p>"<i>Here's the blip! It's crazy! Nothing can go that fast!</i>"</p>

<p>And then in the phones there came the relayed signal
of the auto-beacon in the vanished rocket. The signal-sound
was that of a radar pulse, beginning at low pitch and rising
three octaves in the tenth of a second. At middle C&mdash;the
middle of the range of a piano&mdash;there was a momentary
spurt of extra volume. But in the relayed signal that louder
instant had dropped four tones. Cochrane said crisply:</p>

<p>"Jones, what speed would that be?"</p>

<p>"<i>It'd take a slide-rule to figure it</i>," said Jones' voice, very
calmly, "<i>but it's faster than anything ever went before.</i>"</p>

<p>Cochrane waited for the next beep. It did not come in
ten seconds. It was easily fifteen. Even he could figure out
what that meant! A signal-source that stretched ten seconds
of interval at source to fifteen at reception ...</p>

<p>The voice from the observatory wailed:</p>

<p>"<i>It's crazy! It can't be going like that!</i>"</p>

<p>They waited. Fifteen seconds more. Sixteen. Eighteen.
Twenty. The beep sounded. The spurt of sound had
dropped a full octave. The signal-rocket, traveling normally,
might have attained a maximum velocity of some two
thousand feet per second. It was now moving at a speed
which was an appreciably large fraction of the speed of
light. Which was starkly impossible. It simply happened
to be true.</p>

<p>They heard the signal once more. The observatory's
multiple-receptor receiver had been stepped up to maximum
amplification. The signal was distinct, but very faint indeed.
And the rocket was then traveling&mdash;so it was later computed&mdash;at
seven-eighths of the speed of light. Between the
flat cone on the front of the distress-torpedo, and the flat
cone on the ground, a field of force existed. The field
was not on the back surface of the torpedo's cone, but before
the front surface. It went back to the moon from there,
so all the torpedo and its batteries were in the columnar
stressed space. And an amount of rocket-push that should
have sent the four-foot torpedo maybe twenty miles during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
its period of burning, had actually extended its flight to
more than thirty-seven hundred miles before the red sparks
were too far separated to be traced any farther, and by
then had kicked the torpedo up impossibly close to light-speed.</p>

<p>In a sense, the Dabney field had an effect similar to the
invention of railways. The same horsepower moved vastly
more weight faster, over steel rails, than it could haul over
a rutted dirt road. The same rocket-thrust moved more
weight faster in the Dabney field than in normal space.
There would be a practical limit to the speed at which a
wagon could be drawn over a rough road. The speed of
light was a limit to the speed of matter in normal space.
But on a railway the practical speed at which a vehicle
could travel went up from three miles an hour to a hundred
and twenty. In the Dabney field it was yet to be discovered
what the limiting velocity might be. But old formulas for
acceleration and increase-of-mass-with-velocity simply did
not apply in a Dabney field.</p>

<p>Jones rode back to Lunar City with Cochrane and
Holden and Babs. His face was dead-pan.</p>

<p>Babs tried to recover the mien and manner of the perfect
secretary.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cochrane," she said professionally, "will you want
to read the publicity releases Mr. Bell turns out from what
Mr. West and Mr. Jamison tell him?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it matters," said Cochrane. "The newsmen
will pump West and Jamison empty, anyhow. It's all
right. In fact, it's better than our own releases would be.
They'll contradict each other. It'll sound more authentic
that way. We're building up a customer-demand for information."</p>

<p>The small moon-jeep rolled and bumped gently down
the long, improbable highway back to Lunar City. Its engine
ran smoothly, as steam-engines always do. It ran on seventy
per cent hydrogen peroxide, first developed as a fuel back
in the 1940s for the pumps of the V2 rockets that tried to
win the Second World War for Germany. When hydrogen
peroxide comes in contact with a catalyst, such as permanganate
of potash, it breaks down into oxygen and water.
But the water is in the form of high-pressure steam, which
is used in engines. The jeep's fuel supplied steam for power
and its ashes were water to drink and oxygen to breathe.
Steam ran all motorized vehicles on Luna.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you thinking about, Jones?" asked Cochrane
suddenly.</p>

<p>Jones said meditatively:</p>

<p>"I'm wondering what sort of field-strength a capacity-storage
system would give me. I boosted the field intensity
this time. The results were pretty good. I'm thinking&mdash;suppose
I made the field with a strobe-light power-pack&mdash;or
maybe a spot-welding unit. Even a portable strobe-light
gives a couple of million watts for the forty-thousandth of
a second. Suppose I fixed up a storage-pack to give me a
field with a few billion watts in it? It might be practically
like matter-transmission, though it would really be only
high-speed travel. I think I've got to work on that idea a
little ..."</p>

<p>Cochrane digested the information in silence.</p>

<p>"Far be it from me," he said presently, "to discourage
such high-level contemplation. Bill, what's on your mind?"</p>

<p>Holden said moodily:</p>

<p>"I'm convinced that the thing works. But Jed! You
talk as if you hadn't any more worries! Yet even if you
and Jones do have a way to make a ship travel faster than
light, you haven't got a ship or the capital you need&mdash;."</p>

<p>"I've got scenery that looks like a ship," said Cochrane
mildly. "Consider that part settled."</p>

<p>"But there are supplies. Air&mdash;water&mdash;food&mdash;a crew&mdash;.
We can't pay for such things! Here on the moon the cost
of everything is preposterous! How can you try out this idea
without more capital than you can possibly raise?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to imitate my old friend Christopher Columbus,"
said Cochrane. "I'm going to give the customers what
they want. Columbus didn't try to sell anybody shares in
new continents. Who wanted new continents? Who wanted
to move to a new world? Who wants new planets now?
Everybody would like to see their neighbors move away and
leave more room, but nobody wants to move himself.
Columbus sold a promise of something that had an already-established
value, that could be sold in every town and
village&mdash;that had a merchandising system already set up!
I'm going to offer just such a marketable commodity. I'll
have freight-rockets on the way up here within twenty-four
hours, and the freight and their contents will all be paid
for!"</p>

<p>He turned to Babs. He looked more sardonic and cynical
than ever before.</p>

<p>"Babs, you've just witnessed one of the moments that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
ought to be illustrated in all the grammar-school history-books
along with Ben Franklin flying a kite. What's topmost
in your mind?"</p>

<p>She hesitated and then flushed. The moon-jeep crunched
and clanked loudly over the trail that led downhill. There
was no sound outside, of course. There was no air. But the
noise inside the moon-vehicle was notable. The steam-motor,
in particular, made a highly individual racket.</p>

<p>"I'd&mdash;rather not say," said Babs awkwardly. "What's
your own main feeling, Mr. Cochrane?"</p>

<p>"Mine?" Cochrane grinned. "I'm thinking what a hell
of a funny world this is, when people like Dabney and Bill
and Jones and I are the ones who have to begin operation
outer space!"</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_FOUR" id="CHAPTER_FOUR"></a>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>


<p>Cochrane said kindly into the vision-beam microphone
to Earth, "Cancel section C, paragraph nine. Then
section b(1) from paragraph eleven. Then after you've
canceled the entire last section&mdash;fourteen&mdash;we can sign up
the deal."</p>

<p>There was a four-second pause. About two seconds for
his voice to reach Earth. About two seconds for the beginning
of the reply to reach him. The man at the other
end protested wildly.</p>

<p>"We're a long way apart," said Cochrane blandly, "and
our talk only travels at the speed of light. You're not talking
from one continent to another. Save tolls. Yes or no?"</p>

<p>Another four-second pause. The man on Earth profanely
agreed. Cochrane signed the contract before him. The
other man signed. Not only the documents but all conversation
was recorded. There were plugged-in witnesses. The
contract was binding.</p>

<p>Cochrane leaned back in his chair. His eyes blinked
wearily. He'd spent hours going over the facsimile-transmitted
contract with Joint Networks, and had weeded out
a total of six joker-stipulations. He was very tired. He
yawned.</p>

<p>"You can tell Jones, Babs," he said, "that all the high
financing's done. He can spend money. And you can transmit
my resignation to Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe.
And since this is a pretty risky operation, you'd better
send a service message asking what you're to do with yourself.
They'll probably tell you to take the next rocket back
and report to the secretarial pool, I'm afraid. The same
fate probably awaits West and Jamison and Bell."</p>

<p>Babs said guiltily:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cochrane&mdash;you've been so busy I had to use my
own judgment. I didn't want to interrupt you&mdash;."</p>

<p>"What now?" demanded Cochrane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"The publicity on the torp-test," said Babs guiltily, "was
so good that the firm was worried for fear we'd seem to
be doing it for a client of the firm&mdash;which we are. So we've
all been put on a leave-with-expenses-and-pay status. Officially,
we're all sick and the firm is paying our expenses
until we regain our health."</p>

<p>"Kind of them," said Cochrane. "What's the bite?"</p>

<p>"They're sending up talent contracts for us to sign,"
admitted Babs. "When we go back, we would command
top prices for interviews. The firm, of course, will want to
control that."</p>

<p>Cochrane raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I see! But you'll actually be kept off the air so Dabney
can be television's fair-haired boy. He'll go on Marilyn
Winter's show, I'll bet, because that has the biggest
audience on the planet. He'll lecture Little Aphrodite Herself
on the constants of space and she'll flutter her eyelashes
at him and shove her chest-measurements in his direction
and breathe how wonderful it is to be a man of science!"</p>

<p>"How'd you know?" demanded Babs, surprised.</p>

<p>Cochrane winced.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me, Babs, I didn't. I tried to guess at
something too impossible even for the advertising business!
But I failed! I failed! You and my official gang, then,
are here with the firm's blessing, free of all commands
and obligations, but drawing salary and expenses?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Babs. "And so are you."</p>

<p>"I get off!" said Cochrane firmly. "Forward my resignation.
It's a matter of pure vanity. But Kursten, Kasten,
Hopkins and Fallowe do move in a mysterious way to latch
onto a fast buck! I'm going to get some sleep. Is there
anything else you've had to use your judgment on?"</p>

<p>"The contracts for re-broadcast of the torp-test. The
original broadcast had an audience-rating of seventy-one!"</p>

<p>"Such," said Cochrane, "are the uses of fame. Our
cash?"</p>

<p>She showed him a neatly typed statement. For the
original run of the torp-test film-tape, so much. It was to
be re-run with a popularization of the technical details by
West, and a lurid extrapolation of things to come by Jamison.
The sponsors who got hold of commercial time with
that expanded and souped-up version would expect, and
get, an audience-rating unparalleled in history. Dabney
was to take a bow on the rebroadcast, too&mdash;very much the
dignified and aloof scientist. There were other interviews.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Dabney again, from a script written by Bell. And Jones.
Jones hated the idea of being interviewed, but he had faced
a beam-camera and answered idiotic questions, and gone
angrily back to his work.</p>

<p>Spaceways, Inc., had a bank-account already amounting
to more than twenty years of Cochrane's best earning-power.
He was selling publicity for sponsors to hang their
commercials on, in a strict parallel to Christopher <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'Columbus','.">Columbus'</ins>
selling of spices to come. But Cochrane was delivering
for cash. Freight-rockets were on the way moonward
now, whose cargoes of supplies for a space-journey Cochrane
was accepting only when a bonus in money was paid
for the right to brag about it. So-and-so's oxygen paid for
the privilege of supplying air-reserves. What's-his-name's
dehydrated vegetables were accepted on similar terms, with
whoosit's instant coffee and somebody else's noodle soup
in bags.</p>

<p>"If," said Cochrane tiredly, looking up from the statement,
"we could only start off in a fleet instead of a single
ship, Babs, we'd not only be equipped but so rich before
we started that we'd want to stay home to enjoy it!" He
yawned prodigiously. "I'm going to get some sleep. Don't
let me sleep too long!"</p>

<p>He went off to his hotel-room and was out cold before
his head had drifted down to its pillow. But he was not
pleased with himself. It annoyed him that his revolt against
being an expendable employee had taken the form of acting
like one of his former bosses in collecting ruthlessly for the
brains&mdash;in the case of Jones&mdash;and the neurotic idiosyncrasies&mdash;in
the case of Dabney&mdash;of other men. The gesture
by which he had become independent was not quite the
splendid, scornful one he'd have liked. The fact that this
sort of gesture worked, and nothing else would have, did
not make him feel better.</p>

<p>But he slept.</p>

<p>He dreamed that he was back at his normal business of
producing a television show. Nobody but himself cared
whether the show went on or not. The actual purpose of
all his subordinates seemed to be to cut as many throats
among their fellow-workers as possible&mdash;in a business way,
of course&mdash;so that by their own survival they might succeed
to a better job and higher pay. This is what is called the fine
spirit of teamwork by which things get done, both in private
and public enterprise.</p>

<p>It was a very realistic dream, but it was not restful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>While he slept, the world wagged on and the cosmos
continued on its normal course. The two moons of Earth&mdash;one
natural and one artificial&mdash;swung in splendid circles
about. A psychiatrist should not be the means of associ-<em>[One or more lines of missing text]</em>
that planet's divided rings. The red spot of Jupiter and
the bands on that gas-giant world moved in orderly fashion
about its circumference. Light-centuries away, giant Cepheid
suns expanded monstrously and contracted again,
rather more rapidly than their gravitational fields could account
for. Double stars sedately swung about each other.
Comets reached their farthest points and, mere aggregations
of frigid jagged stones and metal, prepared for another
plunge back into light and heat and warmth.</p>

<p>And various prosaic actions took place on Luna.</p>

<p>When Cochrane waked and went back to the hotel-room
in use as an office, he found Babs talking confidentially
to a woman&mdash;girl, rather&mdash;whom Cochrane
vaguely remembered. Then he did a double take. He did
remember her. Three <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'of'.">or</ins> four years before she'd been the
outstanding television personality of the year. She'd been
pretty, but not so pretty that you didn't realize that she
was a person. She was everything that Marilyn Winters
was not&mdash;and she'd been number two name in television.</p>

<p>Cochrane said blankly:</p>

<p>"Aren't you Alicia Keith?"</p>

<p>The girl smiled faintly. She wasn't as pretty as she had
been. She looked patient. And an expression of patience,
on a woman's face, is certainly not unpleasant. But it isn't
glamorous, either.</p>

<p>"I was," she said. "I married Johnny Simms."</p>

<p>Cochrane looked at Babs.</p>

<p>"They live up here," explained Babs. "I pointed him
out at the swimming-pool the day we got here."</p>

<p>"Wonderful," said Cochrane. "How&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Johnny," said Alicia, "has bought into your Spaceways
corporation. He got your man West drunk and bought his
shares of Spaceway stock."</p>

<p>Cochrane sat down&mdash;not hard, because it was impossible
to sit down hard on the moon. But he sat down as hard
as it was possible to sit.</p>

<p>"Why'd he do that?"</p>

<p>"He found out you had hold of the old Mars colony
ship. He understands you're going to take a trip out to the
stars. He wants to go along. He's very much like a little
boy. He hates it here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why live&mdash;." Cochrane checked the question, not
quite in time.</p>

<p>"He can't go back to Earth," said Alicia calmly. "He's
a psychopathic personality. He's sane and quite bright and
rather dear in his way, but he simply can't remember what
is right and wrong. Especially when he gets excited. When
they fixed up Lunar City as an international colony, by
sheer oversight they forgot to arrange for extradition from
it. So Johnny can live here. He can't live anywhere else&mdash;not
for long."</p>

<p>Cochrane said nothing.</p>

<p>"He wants to go with you," said Alicia pleasantly. "He's
thrilled. The lawyer his family keeps up here to watch over
him is thrilled, too. He wants to go back and visit his
family. And as a stockholder, Johnny can keep you from
taking a ship or any other corporate property out of the
jurisdiction of the courts. But he'd rather go with you.
Of course I have to go too."</p>

<p>"It's blackmail," said Cochrane without heat. "A pretty
neat job of it, too. Babs, you see Holden about this. He's
a psychiatrist." He turned to Alicia. "Why do you want
to go? I don't know whether it'll be dangerous or not."</p>

<p>"I married Johnny," said Alicia. Her smile was composed.
"I thought it would be wonderful to be able to trust
somebody that nobody else could trust." After a moment
she added: "It would be, if one could."</p>

<p>A few moments later she went away, very pleasantly and
very calmly. Her husband had no sense of right or wrong&mdash;not
in action, anyhow. She tried to keep him from doing
too much damage by exercising the knowledge she had of
what was fair and what was not. Cochrane grimaced and
told Babs to make a note to talk to Holden. But there were
other matters on hand, too. There were waivers to be signed
by everybody who went along off Luna. Then Cochrane
said thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"Alicia Keith would be a good name for film-tape ..."</p>

<p>He plunged into the mess of paper-work and haggling
which somebody has to do before any achievement of consequence
can come about. Pioneer efforts, in particular, require
the same sort of clearing-away process as the settling
of a frontier farm. Instead of trees to be chopped and dug
up by the roots, there are the gratuitous obstructionists who
have to be chopped off at the ankles in a business way, and
the people who exercise infinite ingenuity trying to get a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
cut of something&mdash;anything&mdash;somebody else is doing. And
of course there are the publicity-hounds. Since Spaceways
was being financed on sales of publicity which could be
turned on this product and that, publicity-hounds cut into
its revenue and capital.</p>

<p>Back on Earth a crackpot inventor had a lawyer busily
garnering free advertisement by press conferences about
the injury done his client by Spaceways, Inc., who had
stolen his invention to travel through space faster than light.
Somebody in the Senate made a speech accusing the Spaceway
project of being a political move by the party in power
for some dire ultimate purpose.</p>

<p>Ultimately the crackpot inventor would get on the air
and announce triumphantly that only part of his invention
had been stolen, because he'd been too smart to write it
down or tell anybody, and he wouldn't tell anybody&mdash;not
even a court&mdash;the full details of his invention unless paid
twenty-five million in cash down, and royalties afterward.
The project for a congressional investigation of Spaceways
would die in committee.</p>

<p>But there were other griefs. The useless spaceship hulk
had to be emptied of the mining-tools stored in it. This
was done by men working in space-suits. Occupational rules
required them to exert not more than one-fourth of the
effort they would have done if working for themselves.
When the ship was empty, air was released in it, and immediately
froze to air-snow. So radiant heaters had to be
installed and powered to warm up the hull to where an
atmosphere could exist in it. Its generators had to be
thawed from the metal-ice stage of brittleness and warmed
to where they could be run without breaking themselves
to bits.</p>

<p>But there were good breaks, too. Presently a former
moonship-pilot&mdash;grounded to an administrative job on
Luna&mdash;on his own free time checked over the ship. Jones
arranged it. With rocket-motors of adamite&mdash;the stuff
discovered by pure accident in a steel-mill back on Earth&mdash;the
propelling apparatus checked out. The fuel-pumps had
been taken over in fullness of design from fire-engine
pumps on Earth. They were all right. The air-regenerating
apparatus had been developed from the aeriating culture-tanks
in which antibiotics were grown on Earth. It needed
only reseeding with algae&mdash;microscopic plants which when
supplied with ultraviolet light fed avidly on carbon dioxide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and yielded oxygen. The ship was a rather involved combination
of essentially simple devices. It could be put back
into such workability as it had once possessed with practically
no trouble.</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p>Jones moved into it, with masses of apparatus from the
laboratory in the Lunar Apennines. He labored lovingly,
fanatically. Like most spectacular discoveries, the Dabney
field was basically simple. It was almost idiotically uncomplicated.
In theory it was a condition of the space just
outside one surface of a sheet of metal. It was like that conduction-layer
on the wires of a cross-country power-cable,
when electricity is transmitted in the form of high-frequency
alterations and travels on the skins of many strands of
metal, because high-frequency current simply does not flow
inside of wires, but only on their surfaces. The Dabney
field formed on the surface&mdash;or infinitesimally beyond it&mdash;of
a metal sheet in which eddy-currents were induced in
such-and-such a varying fashion. That was all there was
to it.</p>

<p>So Jones made the exterior forward surface of the
abandoned spaceship into a generator of the Dabney field.
It was not only simple, it was too simple! Having made the
bow of the ship into a Dabney field plate, he immediately
arranged that he could, at will, make the rear of the ship
into another Dabney field plate. The two plates, turned on
together, amounted to something that could be contemplated
with startled awe, but Jones planned to start off, at
least, in a manner exactly like the distress-torp test. The
job of wiring up for faster-than-light travel, however, was
not much more difficult than wiring a bungalow, when one
knew how it should be done.</p>

<p>Two freight-rockets came in, picked up by radar and
guided to landings by remote control. The Lunar City beam
receiver picked up music aimed up from Earth and duly
relayed it to the dust-heaps which were the buildings of the
city. The colonists and moon-tourists became familiar with
forty-two new tunes dealing with prospective travel to the
stars. One work of genius tied in a just-released film-tape
drama titled "<i>Child of Hate</i>" to the Lunar operation, and
charmed listeners saw and heard the latest youthful tenor
gently plead, "<i>Child of Hate, Come to the Stars and Love</i>."
The publicity department responsible for the masterpiece
considered itself not far from genius, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>There was confusion thrice and four and five times
confounded. Cochrane came in to dispute furiously with
Holden whether it was better to have a psychopathic personality
on the space-ship or to have a legal battle in the
courts. Cochrane won. Jones arrived, belligerent, to do
battle for technical devices which would cost money.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Cochrane harassedly. "I'm not trying to
boss you! Don't come to me for authority! If you can make
that ship take off I'll be in it, and my neck will be in as
much danger as yours. You buy what will keep my neck
as safe as possible, along with yours. I'm busy raising
money and fighting off crackpots and dodging lawsuits and
getting supplies! I've got a job that needs three men anyhow.
All I'm hoping is that you get ready to take off
before I start cutting out paperdolls. When can we leave?"</p>

<p>"We?" said Jones suspiciously. "You're going?"</p>

<p>"If you think I'll stay behind and face what'll happen
if this business flops," Cochrane told him, "you're crazy!
There are too many people on Earth already. There's no
room for a man who tried something big and failed! If this
flops I'd rather be a frozen corpse with a happy smile on
my face&mdash;I understand that in space one freezes&mdash;than
somebody living on assisted survival status on Earth!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jones, mollified. "How many people are
to go?"</p>

<p>"Ask Bill Holden," Cochrane told him. "Remember,
if you need something, get it. I'll try to pay for it. If we
come back with picture-tapes of outer space&mdash;even if we
only circumnavigate Mars!&mdash;we'll have money enough to
pay for anything!"</p>

<p>Jones regarded Cochrane with something almost like
warmth.</p>

<p>"I like this way of doing business," he said.</p>

<p>"It's not business!" protested Cochrane. "This is getting
something done! By the way. Have you picked out a
destination for us to aim at?" When Jones shook his head,
Cochrane said harassedly; "Better get one picked out. But
when we make out our sail-off papers, for destination we'll
say, 'To the stars.' A nice line for the news broadcasts.
Oh, yes. Tell Bill Holden to try to find us a skipper. An
astrogator. Somebody who can tell us how to get back
if we get anywhere we need to get back from. Is there such
a person?"</p>

<p>"I've got him," said Jones. "He checked the ship for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
me. Former moon-rocket pilot. He's here in Lunar City.
Thanks!"</p>

<p>He shook hands with Cochrane before he left. Which
for Jones was an expression of overwhelming emotion.
Cochrane turned back to his desk.</p>

<p>"Let's see ... That arrangement for cachets on stamps
and covers to be taken along and postmarked Outer Space.
Put in a stipulation for extra payment in case we touch
on planets and invent postmarks for them ..."</p>

<p>He worked on, while Babs took notes. Presently he was
dictating. And as he talked, frowning, he took a fountain-pen
from his pocket and absently worked the refill-handle.
It made ink exude from the pen-point. On the moon, the
surface tension of the ink was exactly the same as on earth,
but the gravity was five-sixths less. So a drop of ink of
really impressive size could be formed before the moon's
weak gravity made it fall.</p>

<p>Dictating as he worked the pen, Cochrane achieved a
pear-shaped mass of ink which was quite the size of a large
grape before it fell into his waste-basket. It was the largest
he'd made to date. It fell&mdash;slow-motion&mdash;and splashed&mdash;violently&mdash;as
he regarded it with harried satisfaction.</p>

<p>More time passed. A moon-rocket arrived from Earth.
There were new tourists under the thousand-foot plastic
dome. Out by the former Mars-ship Jones made experiments
with small plastic balloons coated with a conducting
varnish. In a vacuum, a cubic inch of air at Earth-pressure
will expand to make many cubic feet of near-vacuum. If
a balloon can sustain an internal pressure of one ounce
to the square foot, a thimbleful of air will inflate a sizeable
globe to that pressure. Jones was arranging tiny Dabney
field robot-generators with tiny atomic batteries to power
them. Each such balloon would be a Dabney field "plate"
when cast adrift in emptiness, and its little battery would
keep it in operation for twenty years or more.</p>

<p>Baggage came up from Earth for Johnny Simms. It was
mostly elephant-guns and ammunition for them. Johnny, as
the heir to innumerable millions back on earth, had had a
happy life, but hardly one to give him a practical view of
things. To him, star-travel meant landing on such exotic
planets as the fictioneers had been writing about for a hundred
years or so. He really looked upon the venture into
space as a combined big-game expedition and escape from
Lunar City. And he did look forward, too, to freedom from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
his family's legal representative and the constant reminder
of ethical and moral values which Johnny preferred happily
to ignore.</p>

<p>Film-tape came up, and cameras to use it in. Every
imaginable item an expedition to space could use or even
might use, was thrust upon Spaceways, Inc. Manufacturers
yearned to have their products used in connection with the
hottest news story in decades. There was a steady trailing
of moon-jeeps from the airlocks of Lunar City to the ship.</p>

<p>The time of lunar sunset arrived&mdash;503:30 o'clock, half-past
five hundred and three hours. Time was measured from
midnight to midnight, astronomical fashion. The great,
blazing sun whose streamer prominences, even, were too
bright to be looked at with the naked eye&mdash;the sun neared
and reached the horizon. There was no change in the star-studded
sky. There were no sunset colorings. The incandescent
brightness on the mountains was not lessened in the
least. Only the direction of the stark black shadows shifted.</p>

<p>The glaring sun descended. Its motion was almost infinitely
slow. Its disk was of the order of half a degree of
arc, and it took a full hour to be fully obscured. And then
there was at first no difference in the look of things save
that the <i>Mare Imbrium</i>&mdash;the solidified, arid Sea of Showers&mdash;was
as dark as the shadows in the mountains.</p>

<p>They still gleamed brightly. For a very long time the
white-hot sunshine glowed on their flanks. The brightness
rose and rose, and blackness followed it. At long last only
the topmost peaks of the Apennines blazed luridly against
a background of stars whose light seemed feeble by comparison.</p>

<p>Then it was night indeed. But the Earth shone forth,
a half-globe of seas and clouds and continents, vast and
nostalgic in the sky. And now Earthshine fell upon the
moon. It was many times brighter than moonlight ever
was upon the Earth. Even at lunar sunset the Earthlight
was sixteen times brighter. At midnight, when the Earth
was full, it would be bright enough for any activity. Actually,
the human beings on Luna were nearly nocturnal
in their habits, because it was easier to run moon-jeeps
in frigidity and keep men and machines warm enough for
functioning, than it was to protect them against the more-than-boiling
heat of midday on the moon.</p>

<p>So the activity about the salvaged space-ship increased.
There were electric lights blazing in the demi-twilight, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
guide freight vehicles with their loads. The tourist-jeeps
went and returned and went and returned. The last shipload
of travelers from Earth wanted to see the space-craft
about which all the world was talking.</p>

<p>Even Cochrane presently became curious. There came
a time when all the paper-work connected with what had
happened was done with, and conditional contracts drawn
up on everything that could be foreseen. It was time for
something new to happen.</p>

<p>Cochrane said dubiously:</p>

<p>"Babs, have you seen the ship?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better go take a look at it," said Cochrane.
"Do you know, I've been acting like a damned business
man! I've only been out of Lunar City three times. Once
to the laboratory to talk, once to test a signal-rocket across
the crater, and once when the distress-torp went off. I
haven't even seen the nightclub here in the City!"</p>

<p>"You should," said Babs matter-of-factly. "I went once,
with Doctor Holden. The dancing was marvelous!"</p>

<p>"Bill Holden, eh?" said Cochrane. He found himself
annoyed. "Took you to the nightclub; but not to see the
ship!"</p>

<p>"The ship's farther," explained Babs. "I could always
be found at the nightclub if you needed me. I went when
you were asleep."</p>

<p>"Damn!" said Cochrane. "Hm ... You ought to get a
bonus. What would you rather have, Babs, a bonus in cash
or Spaceways stock?"</p>

<p>"I've got some stock," said Babs. "Mr. Bell&mdash;the writer,
you know&mdash;got in a poker game. He was cleaned out. So
I gave him all the money I had&mdash;I told you I cleared out
my savings-account before we came up, I think&mdash;for half
his shares."</p>

<p>"Either you got very badly stuck," Cochrane told her
cynically, "or else you'll be so rich you won't speak to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Babs warmly. "Never!"</p>

<p>Cochrane yawned.</p>

<p>"Let's get out and take a look at the ship. Maybe I
can stow cargo or something, now there's no more paper-work."</p>

<p>Babs said with an odd calm:</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones wanted you out there today&mdash;in an hour,
he said. I promised you'd go. I meant to mention it in
time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Cochrane did not notice her tone. He was dead-tired,
as only a man can be who has driven himself at top speed
for days on end over a business deal. Business deals are
stimulating only in their major aspects. Most of the details
are niggling, tedious, routine, and boring&mdash;and very often
bear-trapped. Cochrane had done, with only Babs' help, an
amount of mental labor that in the offices of Kursten,
Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe would have been divided
among two vice-presidents, six lawyers, and at least twelve
account executives. The work, therefore, would actually
have been done by not less than twenty secretaries. But
Babs and Cochrane had done it all.</p>

<p>In the moon-jeep on the way to the ship he felt that
heavy, exhausted sense of relaxation which is not pleasurable
at all. Babs annoyed him a little, too. She was late
getting to the airlock, and seemed breathless when she
arrived.</p>

<p>The moon-jeep crunched and clanked and rumbled over
the gently undulating lava sea beneath its giant wheels.
Babs looked zestfully out of the windows. The picture was,
of course, quite incredible. In the relatively dim Earthlight
the moonscape was somehow softened, and yet the impossibly
jagged mountains and steep cliffsides and the
razor-edged passes of monstrous stone,&mdash;these things remained
daunting. It was like riding through a dream in
which everything nearby seemed fey and glamorous, but
the background was deathly-still and ominous.</p>

<p>There were the usual noises inside the jeep. The air
had a metallic smell. One could detect the odors of oil,
and ozone, and varnish, and plastic upholstery. There were
the crunching sounds of the wheels, traveling over stone.
There was the paradoxic gentleness of all the jeep's motions
because of the low gravity. Cochrane even noted the extraordinary
feel of an upholstered seat when one weighs
only one-sixth as much as back on Earth. All his sensations
were dreamlike&mdash;but he felt that headachy exhaustion
that comes of overwork too long continued.</p>

<p>"I'll try," he said tiredly, "to see that you have some
fun before you go back, Babs. You'll go back as soon as
we dive off into whatever we're diving into, but you ought
to get in the regular tourist stuff up here, anyhow."</p>

<p>Babs said nothing. Pointedly.</p>

<p>The moon-jeep clanked and rumbled onward. The hissing
of steam was audible. The vehicle swung around a pinnacle
of stone, and Cochrane saw the space-ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>In the pale Earthlight it was singularly beautiful. It had
been designed to lure investors in a now-defunct promotion.
It was stream-lined, and gigantic, and it glittered like silver.
It stood upright on its tail-fins, and it had lighted ports
and electric lights burned in the emptiness about it. But
there was only one moon-jeep at its base. A space-suited
figure moved toward a dangling sling and sat in it. He rose
deliberately toward an open airlock-hatch, and the other
moon-jeep moved soundlessly away back toward Lunar
City.</p>

<p>There was no debris about. There was no cargo waiting
to be loaded. Cochrane did see a great metal plate, tilted
on the ground, with a large box attached to it by cables.
That would be the generators and the field-plate for a
Dabney field. It was plainly to remain on the moon. It was
not underneath the ship. Cochrane puzzled tiredly over it
for a moment. Then he understood. The ship would lift on
its rockets, hover over the plate&mdash;which would be generating
its half of the field&mdash;and then Jones would switch on
the apparatus in the ship itself. The forward, needle-pointed
nose of the ship would become another generator of the
Dabney field. The ship's inertia, in that field, would be
effectively reduced to a fraction of its former value. The
rockets, which might give it an acceleration of a few hundred
feet per second anywhere but in a Dabney field, would
immediately accelerate the ship and all its contents to an
otherwise unattainable velocity. The occupants of the
rocket would lose their relative inertia to the same degree
as the ship. They should feel no more acceleration than
from the same rocket-thrust in normal space. But they
would travel&mdash;</p>

<p>Cochrane felt that there was a fallacy somehow, in the
working of the Dabney field as he understood it. If there
was less inertia in the Dabney field&mdash;why&mdash;a rocket
shouldn't push as hard in it, because, it was the inertia of
the rocket-gases that gave the rocket-thrust. But Cochrane
was much too tired to work out a theoretic objection to
something he knew did work. He was almost dozing when
Babs touched his arm.</p>

<p>"Space-suits, Mr. Cochrane."</p>

<p>He got wearily into the clumsy costume. But he saw
again that Babs wore the shining-eyed look of rapturous
adventure that he had seen her wear before.</p>

<p>They got out of the moon-jeep, one after the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
The sling came down the space-ship's gleaming side. They
got in it, together. It lifted them.</p>

<p>The vast, polished hull of the space-ship slid past them
only ten feet away. The ground diminished. They seemed
less to be lifted than to float skyward. And in this sling,
in this completely unreal ascent, Cochrane roused suddenly.
He felt the acute unease which comes of height. He had
looked down upon Earth from a height of four thousand
miles with no feeling of dizziness. He had looked at Earth
a quarter-million miles away with no consciousness of
depth. But a mere fifty feet above the surface of the moon
he felt like somebody swinging out of a skyscraper window.</p>

<p>Then the airlock opening was beside them, and the sling
rolled inward. They were in the lock, and Cochrane found
himself pushing Babs away from the unrailed opening. He
was relieved when the airlock closed.</p>

<p>Inside the ship, with the space-suits off, there was light
and warmth, and a remarkably matter-of-fact atmosphere.
The ship had been built to sell stock in a scheme for colonizing
Mars. Prospective investors had been shown through
it. It had been designed to be a convincing passenger-liner
of space.</p>

<p>It was. But Cochrane found himself not needed for any
consultation, and Jones was busy, and Bill Holden highly
preoccupied. He saw Alicia Keith&mdash;but her name was
Simms now. She smiled at him but took Babs by the arm.
They went off somewhere.</p>

<p>Cochrane waited for somebody to tell him what to look
at and to admire. He saw Jamison, and Bell, and he saw
a man he had not seen before. He settled down in a deeply
upholstered chair. He felt neglected. Everybody was busy.
But mostly he felt tired.</p>

<p>He slept.</p>

<p>Then Babs was shaking his arm, her eyes shining.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cochrane!" she cried urgently. "Mr. Cochrane!
Wake up! Go on up to the control-room! We're going to
take off!"</p>

<p>He blinked at her.</p>

<p>"We!" Then he started up, and went five feet into
the air from the violence of his uncalculated movement.
"We? No you don't! You go back to Lunar City where
you'll be safe!"</p>

<p>Then he heard a peculiar drumming, rumbling noise.
He had heard it before. In the moonship. It was rockets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
being tested; being burned; rockets in the very last seconds
of preparation before take-off for the stars.</p>

<p>He didn't drop back to the floor beside the chair he'd
occupied. The floor rose to meet him.</p>

<p>"I've had our baggage brought on board," said Babs,
happily. "I'm going because I'm a stockholder! Hold on to
something and climb those stairs if you want to see us go
up! I'm going to be busy!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_FIVE" id="CHAPTER_FIVE"></a>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>


<p>The physical sensations of ascending to the ship's
control-room were weird in the extreme. Cochrane had just
been wakened from a worn-out sleep, and it was always
startling on the moon to wake and find one's self weighing
one-sixth of normal. It took seconds to remember how
one got that way. But on the way up the stairs, Cochrane
was further confused by the fact that the ship was surging
this way and swaying that. It moved above the moon's
surface to get over the tilted flat Dabney field plate on the
ground a hundred yards from the ship's original position.</p>

<p>The Dabney field, obviously, was not in being. The
ship hovered on its rockets. They had been designed to
lift it off of Earth&mdash;and they had&mdash;against six times the
effective gravity here, and with an acceleration of more
gravities on top of that. So the ship rose lightly, almost
skittishly. When gyros turned to make it drift sidewise&mdash;as
a helicopter tilts in Earth's atmosphere&mdash;it fairly
swooped to a new position. Somebody jockeyed it this way
and that.</p>

<p>Cochrane got to the control-room by holding on with
both hands to railings. He was angry and appalled.</p>

<p>The control-room was a hemisphere, with vertical vision-screens
picturing the stars overhead. Jones stood in an odd
sort of harness beside a set of control-switches that did not
match the smoothly designed other controls of the ship. He
looked out of a plastic blister, by which he could see around
and below the ship. He made urgent signals to a man
Cochrane had never seen before, who sat in a strap-chair
before many other complex controls with his hands playing
back and forth upon them. A loudspeaker blatted unmusically.
It was Dabney's voice, highly agitated and uneasy.</p>

<p>"<i> ... my work for the advancement of science has been
applied by other minds. I need to specify that if the experiment
now about to begin does not succeed, it will not invalidate</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<i>my discovery, which has been amply verified by
other means. It may be, indeed, that my discovery is so
far ahead of present engineering&mdash;.</i>"</p>

<p>"See here!" raged Cochrane. "You can't take off with
Babs on board! This is dangerous!"</p>

<p>Nobody paid any attention. Jones made frantic gestures
to indicate the most delicate of adjustments. The man in
the strap-chair obeyed the instruction with an absorbed attention.
Jones suddenly threw a switch. Something lighted,
somewhere. There was a momentary throbbing sound
which was not quite a sound.</p>

<p>"Take it away," said Jones in a flat voice.</p>

<p>The man in the strap-chair pressed hard on the controls.
Cochrane glanced desperately out of one of the side ports.
He saw the moonscape&mdash;the frozen lava sea with its layer
of whitish-tan moondust. He saw many moon-jeeps
gathered near, as if most of the population of Lunar City
had been gathered to watch this event. He saw the extraordinary
nearness of the moon's horizon.</p>

<p>But it was the most momentary of glimpses. As he
opened his mouth to roar a protest, he felt the upward,
curiously comforting thrust of acceleration to one full
Earth-gravity.</p>

<p>The moonscape was snatched away from beneath the
ship. It did not descend. The ship did not seem to rise.
The moon itself diminished and vanished like a pricked
bubble. The speed of its disappearance was not&mdash;it specifically
was not&mdash;attributable to one earth-gravity of lift
applied on a one-sixth-gravity moon.</p>

<p>The loudspeaker hiccoughed and was silent. Cochrane
uttered the roar he had started before the added acceleration
began. But it was useless. Out the side-port, he saw
the stars. They were not still and changeless and winking,
as they appeared from the moon. These stars seemed to
stir uneasily, to shift ever so slightly among themselves, like
flecks of bright color drifting on a breeze.</p>

<p>Jones said in an interested voice:</p>

<p>"Now we'll try the booster."</p>

<p>He threw another switch. And again there was a momentary
throbbing sound which was not quite a sound. It was
actually a sensation, which one seemed to feel all through
one's body. It lasted only the fraction of a second, but
while it lasted the stars out the side-ports ceased to be
stars. They became little lines of light, all moving toward
the ship's stern but at varying rates of speed. Some of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
passed beyond view. Some of them moved only a little. But
all shifted.</p>

<p>Then they were again tiny spots of light, of innumerable
tints and colors, of every conceivably degree of brightness,
stirring and moving ever-so-slightly with relation to each
other.</p>

<p>"The devil!" said Cochrane, raging.</p>

<p>Jones turned to him. And Jones was not quite poker-faced,
now. Not quite. He looked even pleased. Then his
face went back to impassiveness again.</p>

<p>"It worked," he said mildly.</p>

<p>"I know it worked!" sputtered Cochrane. "But&mdash;where
are we? How far did we come?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea," said Jones mildly as before.
"Does it matter?"</p>

<p>Cochrane glared at him. Then he realized how completely
too late it was to protest anything.</p>

<p>The man he had seen absorbed in the handling of controls
now lifted his hands from the board. The rockets
died. There was a vast silence, and weightlessness. Cochrane
weighed nothing. This was free flight again&mdash;like
practically all of the ninety-odd hours from the space platform
to the moon. The pilot left the controls and in an
accustomed fashion soared to a port on the opposite side
of the room. He gazed out, and then behind, and said in
a tone of astonished satisfaction:</p>

<p>"This is good!&mdash;There's the sun!"</p>

<p>"How far?" asked Jones.</p>

<p>"It's fifth magnitude," said the pilot happily. "We really
did pile on the horses!"</p>

<p>Jones looked momentarily pleased again. Cochrane said
in a voice that even to himself sounded outraged:</p>

<p>"You mean the sun's a fifth-magnitude star from here?
What the devil happened?"</p>

<p>"Booster," said Jones, nearly with enthusiasm. "When
the field was just a radiation speed-up, I used forty milliamperes
of current to the square centimetre of field-plate.
That was the field-strength when we sent the signal-rocket
across the crater. For the distress-torpedo test, I stepped
the field-strength up. I used a tenth of an ampere per
square centimetre. I told you! And don't you remember
that I wondered what would happen if I used a capacity-storage
system?"</p>

<p>Cochrane held fast to a hand-hold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"The more power you put into your infernal field," he
demanded, "the more speed you get?"</p>

<p>Jones said contentedly:</p>

<p>"There's a limit. It depends on the temperature of the
things in the field. But I've fixed up the field, now, like a
spot-welding outfit. Like a strobe-light. We took off with
a light field. It's on now&mdash;we have to keep it on. But I got
hold of some pretty storage condensers. I hooked them up
in parallel to get a momentary surge of high-amperage current
when I shorted them through my field-making coils.
Couldn't make it a steady current! Everything would blow!
But I had a surge of probably six amps per square centimetre
for a while."</p>

<p>Cochrane swallowed.</p>

<p>"The field was sixty times as strong as the one the distress-torpedo
used? We went&mdash;we're going&mdash;sixty times as
fast?"</p>

<p>"We had lots more speed than that!" But then Jones'
enthusiasm dwindled. "I haven't had time to check," he
said unhappily. "It's one of the things I want to get at
right away. But in theory the field should modify the effect
of inertia as the fourth power of its strength. Sixty to the
fourth is&mdash;."</p>

<p>"How far," demanded Cochrane, "is Proxima Centaurus?
That's the nearest star to Earth. How near did we
come to reaching it?"</p>

<p>The pilot on the other side of the control-room said
with a trace less than his former zest:</p>

<p>"That looks like Sirius, over there ..."</p>

<p>"We didn't head for Proxima Centaurus," said Jones
mildly. "It's too close! And we have to keep the field-plate
back on the moon lined up with us, more or less, so we
headed out roughly along the moon's axis. Toward where
its north pole points."</p>

<p>"Then where are we headed? Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"We're not going anywhere just yet," said Jones without
interest. "We have to find out where we are, and from
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cochrane ran his hand through his hair.</p>

<p>"Look!" he protested. "Who's running this show? You
didn't tell me you were going to take off! You didn't pick
out a destination! You didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jones said very patiently:</p>

<p>"We have to try out the ship. We have to find out how
fast it goes with how much field and how much rocket-thrust.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
We have to find out how far we went and if it was
in a straight line. We even have to find out how to land!
The ship's a new piece of apparatus. We can't do things
with it until we find out what it can do."</p>

<p>Cochrane stared at him. Then he swallowed.</p>

<p>"I see," he said. "The financial and business department
of Spaceways, Inc., has done its stuff for the time
being."</p>

<p>Jones nodded.</p>

<p>"The technical staff now takes over?"</p>

<p>Jones nodded again.</p>

<p>"I still think," said Cochrane, "that we could have done
with a little interdepartmental cooperation. How long before
you know what you're about?"</p>

<p>Jones shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't even guess. Ask Babs to come up here, will
you?"</p>

<p>Cochrane threw up his hands. He went toward the
spiral-ladder-with-handholds that led below. He went down
into the main saloon. A tiny green light winked on and off,
urgently, on the far side. Babs was seated at a tiny board,
there. As Cochrane looked, she pushed buttons with professional
skill. Bill Holden sat in a strap-chair with his face
a greenish hue.</p>

<p>"We took off," said Holden in a strained voice.</p>

<p>"We did," said Cochrane. "And the sun's a fifth magnitude
star from where we've got to&mdash;which is no place in
particular. And I've just found out that we started off at
random and Jones and the pilot he picked up are now
happily about to do some pure-science research!"</p>

<p>Holden closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"When you want to cheer me up," he said feebly, "you
can tell me we're about to crash somewhere and this misery
will soon be over."</p>

<p>Cochrane said bitterly:</p>

<p>"Taking off without a destination! Letting Babs come
along! They don't know how far we've come and they don't
know where we're going! This is a hell of a way to run a
business!"</p>

<p>"Who called it a business?" asked Holden, as feebly as
before. "It started out as a psychiatric treatment!"</p>

<p>Babs' voice came from the side of the saloon where she
sat at a vision-tube and microphone. She was saying professionally:</p>

<p>"I assure you it's true. We are linked to you by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Dabney field, in which radiation travels much faster than
light. When you were a little boy didn't you ever put a
string between two tin cans, and then talk along the string?"</p>

<p>Cochrane stopped beside her scowling. She looked up.</p>

<p>"The press association men on Luna, Mr. Cochrane.
They saw us take off, and the radar verified that we
traveled some hundred of thousands of miles, but then we
simply vanished! They don't understand how they can talk
to us without even the time-lag between Earth and Lunar
City. I was explaining."</p>

<p>"I'll take it," said Cochrane. "Jones wants you in the
control-room. Cameras? Who was handling the cameras?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bell," said Babs briskly. "It's his hobby, along
with poker-playing and children."</p>

<p>"Tell him to get some pictures of the star-fields around
us," said Cochrane, "and then you can see what Jones
wants. I will do a little business!"</p>

<p>He settled down in the seat Babs had vacated. He faced
the two press-association reporters in the screen. They
had seen the ship's take off. It was verified beyond any
reasonable question. The microwave beam to Earth was
working at capacity to transmit statements from the Moon
Observatory, which annoyedly conceded that the Spaceways,
Inc., salvaged ship had taken off with an acceleration
beyond belief. But, the astronomers said firmly, the
ship and all its contents must necessarily have been destroyed
by the shock of their departure. The acceleration
must have been as great as the shock of a meteor hitting
Luna.</p>

<p>"You can consider," Cochrane told them, "that I am
now an angel, if you like. But how about getting a statement
from Dabney?"</p>

<p>A press-association man, back on Luna, uttered the first
profanity ever to travel faster than light.</p>

<p>"All he can talk about," he said savagely, "is how wonderful
he is! He agrees with the Observatory that you must
all be dead. He said so. Can you give us any evidence
that you're alive and out in space? Visual evidence, for
broadcast?"</p>

<p>At this moment the entire fabric of the space-ship
moved slightly. There was no sound of rockets. The ship
seemed to turn a little, but that was all. No gravity. No
acceleration. It was a singularly uncomfortable sensation,
on top of the discomfort of weightlessness.</p>

<p>Cochrane said sardonically:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you can't take my word that I'm alive, I'll try to
get you some proof! Hm. I'll send you some pictures of
the star-fields around us. Shoot them to observatories back
on Earth and let them figure out for themselves where we
are! Displacement of the relative positions of the stars
ought to let them figure things out!"</p>

<p>He left the communicator-board. Holden still looked
greenish in his strap-chair. The main saloon was otherwise
empty. Cochrane made his way gingerly to the stair going
below. He stepped into thin air and descended by a pull
on the hand-rail.</p>

<p>This was the dining-saloon. The ship having been built
to impress investors in a stock-sales enterprise, it had been
beautifully equipped with trimmings. And, having had to
rise from Earth to Luna, and needing to take an acceleration
of a good many gravities, it had necessarily to be
reasonably well-built. It had had, in fact, to be an honest
job of ship-building in order to put across a phoney promotion.
But there were trimmings that could have been
spared. The ports opening upon emptiness, for example,
were not really practical arrangements. But everybody but
Holden and the two men in the control-room now clustered
at those ports, looking out at the stars. There was Jamison
and Bell the writer, and Johnny Simms and his wife. Babs
had been here and gone.</p>

<p>Bell was busy with a camera. As Cochrane moved to
tell him of the need for star-shots to prove to a waiting
planet that they were alive, Johnny Simms turned and saw
Cochrane. His expression was amiable and unawed.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Johnny Simms cheerfully.</p>

<p>Cochrane nodded curtly.</p>

<p>"I bought West's stock in Spaceways," said Johnny
Simms, amusedly, "because I want to come along. Right?"</p>

<p>"So I heard," said Cochrane, as curtly as before.</p>

<p>"West said," Johnny Simms told him gleefully, "that
he was going back to Earth, punch Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins
and Fallowe on their separate noses, and then go down
to South Carolina and raise edible snails for the rest of his
life."</p>

<p>"An understandable ambition," said Cochrane. He
frowned, waiting to talk to Bell, who was taking an infernally
long time to focus a camera out of a side-port.</p>

<p>"It's going to be good when he tries to cash my check,"
said Johnny Simms delightedly. "I stopped payment on it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
when he wouldn't pick up the tab for some drinks I invited
him to have!"</p>

<p>Cochrane forced his face to impassiveness. Johnny
Simms was that way, he understood. He was a psychopathic
personality. He was completely insensitive to notions
of ethics. Ideas of right and wrong were as completely
meaningless to him as tones to a tone-deaf person, or
pastel tints to a man who is color-blind. They simply didn't
register. His mind was up to par, and he could be a charming
companion. He could experience the most kindly of
emotions and most generous of impulses, which he put into
practice. But he also had a normal person's impulse to less
admirable behavior, and he simply could not understand
that there was any difference between impulses. He put
the unpleasing ones into practice too. He'd been on the
moon to avoid extradition because of past impulses which
society called murderous. On this ship it was yet to be
discovered what he would do&mdash;but because he was technically
sane his lawyers could have prevented a take off
unless he came along. Cochrane, at the moment, felt an
impulse to heave him out an airlock as a probable danger.
But Cochrane was not a psychopathic personality.</p>

<p>He stopped Bell in his picture-taking and looked at the
first of the prints. They were excellent. He went back to
the vision-set to transmit them back to Luna. He sent
them off. They would be forwarded to observatories on
Earth and inspected. They literally could not be faked.
There were thousands of stars on each print&mdash;with the
Milky Way for background on some&mdash;and each of those
thousands of stars would be identified, and each would
have changed its relative position from that seen on earth,
with relation to every other star. Astronomers could detect
the spot from which the picture had been taken. But
to fake a single print would have required years of computation
and almost certainly there would have been slip-ups
somewhere. These pictures were unassailable evidence
that a human expedition had reached a point in space that
had been beyond all human dreaming.</p>

<p>Then Cochrane had nothing to do. He was a supernumerary
member of the crew. The pilot and Jones were
in charge of the ship. Jamison would take care of the catering,
when meal-time came. Probably Alicia Keith&mdash;no,
Alicia Simms&mdash;would help. Nothing else needed attention.
The rockets either worked or they didn't. The air-apparatus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
needed no supervision. Cochrane found himself without a
function.</p>

<p>He went restlessly back to the control-room. He found
Babs looking helpless, and Jones staring blankly at a slip
of paper in his hands, while the pilot was still at a blister-port,
staring at the stars through one of those squat, thick
telescopes used on Luna for the examination of the planets.</p>

<p>"How goes the research?" asked Cochrane.</p>

<p>"We're stumped," said Jones painfully. "I forgot something."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Whenever I wanted anything," said Jones, "I wrote it
out and gave a memo to Babs. She attended to it."</p>

<p>"My system, exactly," admitted Cochrane.</p>

<p>"I wrote out a memo for her," said Jones unhappily,
"asking for star-charts and for her to get somebody to set
up a system of astrogation for outside the solar system.
Nobody's ever bothered to do that before. Nobody's ever
reached even Mars! But I figured we'd need it."</p>

<p>Cochrane waited. Jones showed him a creased bit of
paper, closely written.</p>

<p>"I wrote out the memo and put it in my pocket," said
Jones, "and I forgot to give it to Babs. So we can't astrogate.
We don't know how. We didn't get either star-charts
or instructions. We're lost."</p>

<p>Cochrane waited.</p>

<p>"Apparently Al was mistaken in the star he spotted as
our sun," added Jones. He referred to the pilot, whom
Cochrane had not met before. "Anyhow we can't find it
again. We turned the ship to look at some more stars,
and we can't pick it out any more."</p>

<p>Cochrane said:</p>

<p>"You'll keep looking, of course."</p>

<p>"For what?" asked Jones.</p>

<p>He waved his hand out the four equally-spaced plastic
blister-ports. From where he stood, Cochrane could see
thousands of thousands of stars out those four small openings.
They were of every conceivable color and degree of
brightness. The Milky Way was like a band of diamonds.</p>

<p>"We know the sun's a yellow star," said Jones, "but we
don't know how bright it should be, or what the sky should
look like beyond it."</p>

<p>"Constellations?" asked Cochrane.</p>

<p>"Find 'em!" said Jones vexedly.</p>

<p>Cochrane didn't try. If a <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphenated to correspond with other usage in text.">moon-rocket</ins> pilot could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
spot familiar star-groups, a television producer wasn't likely
to see them. And it was obvious, once one thought, that
the brighter stars seen from Earth would be mostly the
nearer ones. If Jones was right in his guess that his booster
had increased the speed of the ship by sixty to the fourth
power, it would have gone some millions of times as fast
as the distress-torpedo, for a brief period (the ratio was
actually something over nineteen million times) and it happened
that nobody had been able to measure the speed of
that test-object.</p>

<p>Cochrane was no mathematician, but he could see that
there was no data for computation on hand. After one
found out how fast an acceleration of one Earth-gravity
in a Dabney field of such-and-such strength speeded up a
ship, something like dead reckoning could be managed. But
all that could be known right now was that they had come
a long way.</p>

<p>He remembered a television show he'd produced, laid
in space on an imaginary voyage. The script-writer had
had one of the characters say that no constellation would
be visible at a hundred light-years from the solar system.
It would be rather like a canary trying to locate the window
he'd escaped from, from a block away, with no memories
of the flight from it.</p>

<p>Cochrane said suddenly, in a pleased tone:</p>

<p>"This is a pretty good break&mdash;if we can keep them from
finding out about it back home! We'll have an entirely
new program, good for a thirteen-week sequence, on just
this!"</p>

<p>Babs stared at him.</p>

<p>"Main set, this control-room," said Cochrane enthusiastically.
"We'll get a long-beard scientist back home with
a panel of experts. We'll discuss our problems here! We'll
navigate from home, with the whole business on the air!
We'll have audience-identification up to a record! Everybody
on Earth will feel like he's here with us, sharing our
problems!"</p>

<p>Jones said irritably:</p>

<p>"You don't get it! We're lost! We can't check our speed
without knowing where we are and how far we've come!
We can't find out what the ship will do when we can't find
out what it's done! Don't you see?"</p>

<p>Cochrane said patiently:</p>

<p>"I know! But we're in touch with Luna through the
Dabney field that got us here! It transmitted radiation before,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
faster than light. It's transmitting voice and pictures
now. Now we set up a television show which pays for our
astrogation and lets the world sit in on the prettier aspects
of our travels. Hm.... How long before you can sit down
on a planet, after you have all the navigational aids of&mdash;say&mdash;the
four best observatories on Earth to help you?
I'll arrange for a sponsor&mdash;."</p>

<p>He went happily down the stairs again. This was a spiral
stair, and he zestfully spun around it as he went to the
next deck below. At the bottom he called up to Babs:</p>

<p>"Babs! Get Bell and Alicia Keith and come along to
take dictation! I'm going to need some legal witnesses for
the biggest deal in the history of advertising, made at
several times the speed of light!"</p>

<p>And he went zestfully to the communicator to set it up.</p>

<p>And time passed. Data arrived, which at once solved
Jones' and the pilot's problem of where they were and how
far they had come&mdash;it was, actually, 178.3 light-years&mdash;and
they spent an hour making further tests and getting
further determinations, and then they got a destination.</p>

<p>They stopped in space to extrude from the airlock a
small package which expanded into a forty-foot plastic
balloon with a minute atomic battery attached to it. The
plastic was an electric conductor. It was a field-plate of
the Dabney field. It took over the field from Earth and
maintained it. It provided a second field for the ship to
maintain. The ship, then, could move at any angle from
the balloon. The Dabney field stretched 178.3 light-years
through emptiness to the balloon, and then at any desired
direction to the ship.</p>

<p>The ship's rockets thrust again&mdash;and the booster-circuit
came into play. There were maneuverings. A second
balloon was put out in space.</p>

<p>At 8:30 Central U. S. Time, on a period relinquished
by other advertisers&mdash;bought out&mdash;a new program went on
the air. It was a half-hour show, sponsored by the Intercity
Credit Corporation&mdash;"Buy on Credit Guaranteed"&mdash;with
ten straight minutes of commercials interjected in
four sections. It was the highest-priced show ever put on
the air. It showed the interior of the ship's control-rooms,
with occasional brief switches to authoritative persons on
Earth for comment on what was relayed from the far-off
skies.</p>

<p>The first broadcast ensured the success of the program
beyond possible dispute. It started with curt conversation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
between Jones and the pilot, Al&mdash;Jones loathed this part
of it, but Al turned out to be something of a ham&mdash;on the
problems of approaching a new solar system. Cut to computers
back on Earth. Back to the control-room of the
starship. Pictures of the local sun, and comments on its
differentness from the sun that had nourished the human
race since time began.</p>

<p>Then the cameras&mdash;Bell worked them&mdash;panned down
through the ship's blister-ports. There was a planet below.
The ship descended toward it. It swelled visibly as the
space-ship approached. Cochrane stood out of camera-range
and acted as director as well as producer of the opus.
He used even Johnny Simms as an offstage voice repeating
stern commands. It was corny. There was no doubt about
it. It had a large content of ham.</p>

<p>But it happened to be authentic. The ship had reached
another planet, with vast ice-caps and what appeared to be
no more than a twenty-degree-wide equatorial belt where
there was less than complete glaciation. The rockets roared
and boomed as the ship let down into the cloud-layers.</p>

<p>Television audiences back on Earth viewed the new
planet nearly as soon as did those in the ship. The time-lag
was roughly three seconds for a distance of 203.7 light-years.</p>

<p>The surface of the planet was wild and dramatic beyond
belief. There were valleys where vegetation grew luxuriantly.
There were ranges of snow-clad mountains interpenetrating
the equatorial strip, and there were masses of
white which, as the ship descended, could be identified as
glaciers moving down toward the vegetation.</p>

<p>But as the ship sank lower and lower&mdash;and the sound
of its rockets became thunderous because of the atmosphere
around it&mdash;a new feature took over the central
position in one's concept of what the planet was actually
like.</p>

<p>The planet was volcanic. There were smoking cones
everywhere&mdash;in the snow-fields, among the ice-caps, in between
the glaciers, and even among the tumbled areas
whose greenness proved that here was an environment
which might be perilous, but where life should thrive
abundantly.</p>

<p>The ship continued to descend toward a great forest
near a terminal moraine.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_SIX" id="CHAPTER_SIX"></a>CHAPTER SIX</h2>


<p>Jamison declaimed, wearing a throat-mike as Bell
zestfully panned his camera and the ship swung down. It
was an impressive broadcast. The rockets roared. With
the coming of air about the ship, they no longer made a
mere rumbling. They created a tumult which was like the
growl of thunder if one were in the midst of the thunder-cloud.
It was a numbing noise. It was almost a paralyzing
noise. But Jamison talked with professional smoothness.</p>

<p>"This planet," he orated, while pictures from Bell's
camera went direct to the transmitter below, "this planet is
the first world other than Earth on which a human ship
has landed. It is paradoxic that before men have walked
on Mars' red iron-oxide plains and breathed its thin cold
air, or fought for life in the formaldehyde gales of Venus,
that they should look upon a world which welcomes them
from illimitable remoteness. Here we descend, and all mankind
can watch our descent upon a world whose vegetation
is green; whose glaciers prove that there is air and water
in plenty, whose very smoking volcanoes assure us of its
close kinship to Earth!"</p>

<p>He lifted the mike away from his throat and framed
words with his lips. "<i>Am I still on?</i>" Cochrane nodded.
Cochrane wore headphones carrying what the communicator
carried, as this broadcast went through an angled
Dabney field relay system back to Lunar City and then to
Earth. He spoke close to Jamison's ear.</p>

<p>"Go ahead! If your voice fades, it will be the best possible
sign-off. Suspense. Good television!"</p>

<p>Jamison let the throat-mike back against his skin. The
roaring of the rockets would affect it only as his throat
vibrated from the sound. It would register, even so.</p>

<p>"I see," said Jamison above the rocket-thunder, "forests
of giant trees like the sequoias of Mother Earth. I see
rushing rivers, foaming along their rocky beds, taking their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
rise in glaciers. We are still too high to look for living
creatures, but we descend swiftly. Now we are level with
the highest of the mountains. Now we descend below their
smoking tops. Under us there is a vast valley, miles wide,
leagues long. Here a city could be built. Over it looms a
gigantic mountain-spur, capped with green. One would expect
a castle to be built there."</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows at Cochrane. They were well
in atmosphere, now, and it had been an obvious defect&mdash;condition&mdash;necessity
of the Dabney field that both of its
plates should be in a vacuum. One was certainly in air
now. But Cochrane made that gesture which in television
production-practice informs the actors that time to cutting
is measured in tens of seconds, and he held up two fingers.
Twenty seconds.</p>

<p>"We gaze, and you gaze with us," said Jamison, "upon
a world that future generations will come to know as home&mdash;the
site of the first human colony among the stars!"</p>

<p>Cochrane began to beat time. Ten, nine, eight&mdash;.</p>

<p>"We are about to land," Jamison declaimed. "We do
not know what we shall find&mdash;What's that?" He paused
dramatically. "A living creature?&mdash;A living creature
sighted down below! We sign off now&mdash;from the stars!"</p>

<p>The ending had been perfectly timed. Allowing for a
three-second interval for the broadcast to reach the moon,
and just about two more for it to be relayed to Earth, his
final word, "Stars!" had been uttered at the precise instant
to allow a four-minute commercial by Intercity Credit, in
the United States, by Citroen in Europe, by Fabricanos
Unidos in South and Central America, and Near East Oil
along the Mediterranean. At the end of that four minutes
it would be time for station identification and a time-signal,
and the divers eight-second flashes before other programs
came on the air.</p>

<p>The rockets roared and thundered. The ship went down
and down. Jamison said:</p>

<p>"I thought we'd be cut off when we hit air!"</p>

<p>"That's what Jones thought," Cochrane assured him.
He bellowed above the outside tumult, "Bell! See anything
alive down below?"</p>

<p>Bell shook his head. He stayed at the camera aimed
out a blister-port, storing up film-tape for later use. There
was the feel of gravitation, now. Actually, it was the fact
that the ship slowed swiftly in its descent.</p>

<p>Cochrane went to a port. The ship continued its descent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Living creature? Where?"</p>

<p>Jamison shrugged. He had used it as a sign-off line.
An extrapolation from the fact that there was vegetation
below. He looked somehow distastefully out the port at a
swiftly rising green ground below. He was a city man. He
had literally never before seen what looked like habitable
territory of such vast extent, with no houses on it. In a
valley easily ten miles long and two wide, there was not a
square inch of concrete or of glass. There was not a man
made object in view. The sky was blue and there were
clouds, but to Jamison the sight of vegetation implied
rooftops. There ought to be parapets where roofs ended to
let light down to windows and streets below. He had never
before seen grass save on elevated recreation-areas, nor
bushes not arranged as landscaping, and certainly not trees
other than the domesticated growths which can grow on
the tops of buildings. To Jamison this was desolation. On
the moon, absence of structures was understandable. There
was no air. But here there should be a city!</p>

<p>The ship swayed a little as the rockets swung their blasts
to balance the descending mass. The intended Mars-ship
slowed, and slowed, and hovered&mdash;and there was terrifying
smoke and flame suddenly all about&mdash;and then there was a
distinct crunching impact. The rockets continued to burn,
their ferocity diminished. They slackened again. And yet
again. They were reduced to a mere faint murmur.</p>

<p>There was a remarkable immobility of everything. It
was the result of gravity. Earth-value gravity, or very near
it. There was a distinct pressure of one's feet against the
floor, and a feeling of heaviness to one's body which was
very different from Lunar City, and more different still
from free flight in emptiness.</p>

<p>Nothing but swirling masses of smoke could be seen out
the ports. They had landed in a forest, of sorts, and the
rocket-blasts had burned away everything underneath,
down to solid soil. In a circle forty yards about the ship
the ground was a mass of smoking, steaming ash. Beyond
that flames licked hungrily, creating more dense vapor.
Beyond that still there was only coiling smoke.</p>

<p>Cochrane's headphones yielded Babs' voice, almost
wailing:</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Cochrane! We must have landed! I want to see!</i>"</p>

<p>Cochrane pressed the hand-mike button.</p>

<p>"Are we still hooked up to Lunar City?" he demanded.
"We can't be, but are we?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>We are,</i>" said Babs' voice mutinously. "<i>The broadcast
went through all right. They want to talk to you. Everybody
wants to talk to you!</i>"</p>

<p>"Tell them to call back later," commanded Cochrane.
"Then leave the beam working&mdash;however it works!&mdash;and
come up if you like. Tell the moon operator you'll be
away for ten minutes."</p>

<p>He continued to stare out the window. Al, the pilot,
stayed in his cushioned seat before the bank of rocket-controls.
The rockets were barely alight. The ship stayed
as it had landed, upright on its triple fins. He said to Jones:</p>

<p>"It feels like we're solid. We won't topple!"</p>

<p>Jones nodded. The rocket-sound cut off. Nothing
happened.</p>

<p>"I think we could have saved fuel on that landing,"
said Jones. Then he added, pleased, "Nice! The Dabney
field's still on! It has to be started in a vacuum, but it looks
like it can hold air away from itself once it's established.
Nice!"</p>

<p>Babs rushed up the stairs. She gazed impassionedly out
of a vision-port. Then she said disappointedly:</p>

<p>"It looks like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It looks like hell," said Cochrane. "Just smoke and
steam and stuff. We can hope, though, that we haven't
started a forest fire, but have just burned off a landing-place."</p>

<p>They stared out. Presently they went to another port
and gazed out of that. The smoke was annoying, and yet
it could have been foreseen. A moon-rocket, landing at its
space-port on Earth, heated the tarmac to red-hotness in
the process of landing. Tender-vehicles had to wait for it
to cool before they could approach. Here the ship had
landed in woodland. Naturally its flames had seared the
spot where it came down. And there was inflammable stuff
about, which caught fire. So the ship was in the situation
of a phoenix, necessarily nesting in a conflagration.
Anywhere it landed the same thing would apply, unless
it tried landing on a glacier. But then it would settle down
into a lake of boiling water, amid steam, and could expect
to be frozen in as soon as its landing-place cooled.</p>

<p>Now there was nothing to do. They had to wait. Once
the whole ship quivered very slightly, as if the ground
trembled faintly under it. But there was nothing at which
to be alarmed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>They could see that this particular forest was composed
mainly of two kinds of trees which burned differently. One
had a central trunk, and it burned with resinous flames
and much black and gray-black smoke. The other was a
curious growth&mdash;a solid, massive trunk which did not touch
ground at all, but was held up by aerial roots which supported
it aloft through very many slender shafts widely
spread. Possibly the heavier part was formed on the ground
and lifted as its air-roots grew.</p>

<p>It was irritating, though, to be unable to see from the
ship so long as the fire burned outside. The pall of smoke
lasted for a long time. In three hours there were no longer
any fiercely blazing areas, but the ashes still smouldered
and smoke still rose. In three hours and a half, the local
sun began to set. There were colorings in the sky, beyond
all comparison glorious. Which was logical enough. When
Krakatoa, back on Earth, blew itself to bits in the eighteen
hundreds, it sent such volumes of dust into the air
that sunsets all around the globe were notably improved
for three years afterward. On this planet, smoking cones
were everywhere visible. Volcanic dust, then, made nightfall
magnificent past description. There was not only gold
and crimson in the west. The zenith itself glowed carmine
and yellow, and those in the space-ship gazed up at a
sky such as none of them could have imagined possible.</p>

<p>The colors changed and changed, from yellow to gold
all over the sky, and still the glory continued. Presently
there was a deep, deep red, deep past imagining, and
presently faint bluish stars pierced it, and they stared up
at new strange constellations-some very bright indeed&mdash;and
all about the ship there was a bed of white ash with
glowing embers in it, and a thin sheet of white smoke
still flowed away down the valley.</p>

<p>It was long after sunset when Cochrane got up from
the communicator. Communication with Earth was broken
at last. There was a balloon out in space somewhere with
an atomic battery maintaining all its surface as a Dabney
field plate. The ship maintained a field between itself and
that plate. The balloon maintained another field between
itself and another balloon a mere 178.3 light-years from the
solar system. But the substance of this planet intervened
between the nearer balloon and the ship. Jones made tests
and observed that the field continued to exist, but was
plugged by the matter of this newly-arrived-at world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Come tomorrow, when there was no solid-stone barrier
to the passage of radiation, they could communicate with
Earth again.</p>

<p>But Cochrane was weary and now discouraged. So long
as talk with Earth was possible, he'd kept at it. There
was a great deal of talking to be done. But a good deal of
it was extremely unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>He found Bill Holden having supper with Babs, on the
floor below the communicator. Very much of the recent
talk had been over Cochrane's head. He felt humiliated
by the indignation of scientists who would not tell him
what he wanted to know without previous information he
could not give.</p>

<p>When he went over to the dining-table, he felt that he
creaked from weariness and dejection. Babs looked at
him solicitously, and then jumped up to get him something
to eat. Everybody else was again watching out the ship's
ports at the new, strange world of which they could see
next to nothing.</p>

<p>"Bill," said Cochrane fretfully, "I've just been given the
dressing-down of my life! You're expecting to get out of
the airlock in the morning and take a walk. But I've been
talking to Earth. I've been given the devil for landing on
a strange planet without bringing along a bacteriologist,
an organic chemist, an ecologist, an <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'epidomologist'.">epidemiologist</ins>, and a
complete laboratory to test everything with, before daring
to take a breath of outside air. I'm warned not to open
a port!"</p>

<p>Holden said:</p>

<p>"You sound as if you'd been talking to a biologist with
a reputation. You ought to know better than that!"</p>

<p>Cochrane protested:</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk to somebody who knew more than I
did! What could I do but get a man with a reputation?"</p>

<p>Holden shook his head.</p>

<p>"We psychiatrists," he observed, "go around peeping
under the corners of rugs at what people try to hide from
themselves. We have a worm's-eye view of humanity. We
know better than to throw a difficult problem at a man
with an established name! They're neurotic about their reputations.
Like Dabney, they get panicky at the idea of
anybody catching them in a mistake. No big name in medicine
or biology would dare tell you that of course it's
all right for us to take a walk in the rather pretty landscape
outside."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then who will?" demanded Cochrane.</p>

<p>"We'll make what tests we can," said Holden comfortingly,
"and decide for ourselves. We can take a chance.
We're only risking our lives!"</p>

<p>Babs brought Cochrane a plate. He put food in his
mouth and chewed and swallowed.</p>

<p>"They say we can't afford to breathe the local air at all
until we know its bacteriology; we can't touch anything
until we test it as a possible allergen; we can't."</p>

<p>Holden grunted.</p>

<p>"What would those same authorities have told your
friend Columbus? On a strange continent he'd be sure to
find strange plants and strange animals. He'd find strange
races of men and he ought to find strange diseases. They'd
have warned him not to risk it. <i>They</i> wouldn't!"</p>

<p>Cochrane ate with a sort of angry vigor. Then he
snapped:</p>

<p>"If you want to know, we've got to land! We're sunk
if we don't go outside and move around! We'll spoil our
story-line. This is the greatest adventure-serial anybody
on Earth ever tuned in to follow! If we back down on exploration,
our audience will be disgusted and resentful
and they'll take it out on our sponsors!"</p>

<p>Babs said softly, to Holden:</p>

<p>"That's my boss!"</p>

<p>Cochrane glared at her. He didn't know how to take
the comment. He said to Holden:</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we'll try to figure out some sort of test and
try the air. I'll go out in a space-suit and crack the face-plate!
I can close it again before anything lethal gets in.
But there's no use stepping out into a bed of coals tonight.
I'll have to wait till morning."</p>

<p>Holden smiled at him. Babs regarded him with intent,
enigmatic eyes.</p>

<p>Neither of them said anything more. Cochrane finished
his meal. Then he found himself without an occupation.
Gravity on this planet was very nearly the same as on
Earth. It felt like more, of course, because all of them had
been subject only to moon-gravity for nearly three weeks.
Jones and the pilot had been in one-sixth gravity for a
much longer time. And the absence of gravity had caused
their muscles to lose tone by just about the amount that
the same time spent in a hospital bed would have done.
They felt physically worn out.</p>

<p>It was a healthy tiredness, though, and their muscles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
would come back to normal as quickly as one recovers
strength after illness&mdash;rather faster, in fact. But tonight
there would be no night-life on the space-ship. Johnny
Simms disappeared, after symptoms of fretfulness akin to
those of an over-tired small boy. Jamison gave up, and
Bell, and Al the pilot fell asleep while Jones was trying
to discuss something technical with him. Jones himself
yawned and yawned and when Al snored in his face he
gave up. They retired to their bunks.</p>

<p>There was no point in standing guard over the ship.
If the bed of hot ashes did not guard it, it was not likely
that an individual merely sitting up and staring out its
ports would do much good. There were extremely minor,
practically unnoticeable vibrations of the ship from time
to time. They would be volcanic temblors&mdash;to be expected.
They were not alarming, certainly, and the forest outside
was guarantee of no great violence to be anticipated. The
trees stood firm and tall. There was no worry about the
ship. It was perfectly practical, and even necessary simply
to turn out the lights and go to sleep.</p>

<p>But Cochrane could not relax. He was annoyed by the
soreness of his muscles. He was irritated by the picture
given him of the expedition as a group of heedless ignoramuses
who'd taken off without star-charts or bacteriological
equipment&mdash;without even apparatus to test the air
of planets they might land on!&mdash;and who now were sternly
warned not to make any use of their achievement. Cochrane
was not overwhelmed by the achievement itself, though
less than eighteen hours since the ship and all its company
had been aground on Luna, and now they were landed on
a new world twice as far from Earth as the Pole Star.</p>

<p>It is probable that Cochrane was not awed because he
had a television-producer's point of view. He regarded this
entire affair as a production. He was absorbed in the details
of putting it across. He looked at it from his own,
quite narrow, professional viewpoint. It did not disturb him
that he was surrounded by a wilderness. He considered
the wilderness the set on which his production belonged,
though he was as much a city man as anybody else. He
went back to the control-room. With the ship standing on
its tail that was the highest point, and as the embers
burned out and the smoke lessened it was possible to look
out into the night.</p>

<p>He stared at the dimly-seen trees beyond the burned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
area, and at the dark masses of mountains which blotted
out the stars. He estimated them, without quite realizing
it, in view of what they would look like on a television
screen. When light objects in the control-room rattled
slightly, he paid no attention. His rehearsal-studio had been
rickety, back home.</p>

<p>Babs seemed to be sleepless, too. There was next to
no light where Cochrane was&mdash;merely the monitor-lights
which assured that the Dabney field still existed, though
blocked for use by the substance of a planet. Babs arrived
in the almost-dark room only minutes after Cochrane. He
was moving restlessly from one port to another, staring
out.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd tell you," Babs volunteered, "that Doctor
Holden put some algae from the air-purifier tanks in the
airlock, and then opened the outer door."</p>

<p><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original lacked the closing quote mark.">"Why?"</ins> asked Cochrane.</p>

<p>"Algae's Earth plant-life," explained Babs. "If the air
is poisonous, it will be killed by morning. We can close
the outer door of the lock, pump out the air that came
from this planet, and then let air in from the ship so we
can see what happens."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Cochrane.</p>

<p>"And then I couldn't sleep," said Babs guilelessly. "Do
you mind if I stay here? Everybody else has gone to bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Cochrane. "Stay if you like."</p>

<p>He stared out at the dark. Presently he moved to another
port. After a moment he pointed.</p>

<p>"There's a glow in the sky there," he said curtly.</p>

<p>She looked. There was a vast curving blackness which
masked the stars. Beyond it there was a reddish glare, as
if of some monstrous burning. But the color was not right
for a fire. Not exactly.</p>

<p>"A city?" asked Babs breathlessly.</p>

<p>"A volcano," Cochrane told her. "I've staged shows
that pretended to show intellectual creatures on other
planets&mdash;funny how we've been dreaming of such things,
back on Earth&mdash;but it isn't likely. Not since we've actually
reached the stars."</p>

<p>"Why since then?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Cochrane, half ironically, "man was
given dominion over all created things. I don't think we'll
find rivals for that dominion. I can't imagine we'll find
another race of creatures who could be&mdash;persons. Heaven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
knows we try to rob each other of dignity, but I don't
think there's another race to humiliate us when we find
them!"</p>

<p>After a moment he added:</p>

<p>"Bad enough that we're here because there are deodorants
and cosmetics and dog-foods and such things that
people want to advertise to each other! We wouldn't be
here but for them, and for the fact that some people are
neurotics and some don't like their bosses and some are
crazy in other fashions."</p>

<p>"Some crazinesses aren't bad," argued Babs.</p>

<p>"I've made a living out of them," agreed Cochrane
sourly. "But I don't like them. I have a feeling that I
could arrange things better. I know I couldn't, but I'd like
to try. In my own small way, I'm even trying."</p>

<p>Babs chuckled.</p>

<p>"That's because you are a man. Women aren't so foolish.
We're realists. We like creation&mdash;even men&mdash;the way
creation is."</p>

<p>"I don't," Cochrane said irritably. "We've accomplished
something terrific, and I don't get a kick out of it! My head
is full of business details that have to be attended to tomorrow.
I ought to be uplifted. I ought to be gloating!
I ought to be happy! But I'm worrying for fear that this
infernal planet is going to disappoint our audience!"</p>

<p>Babs chuckled again. Then she went to the stair leading
to the compartment below.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"After all, I'm going to leave you alone," said Babs
cheerfully. "You're always very careful not to talk to me
in any personal fashion. I think you're afraid I'll tell you
something for your own good. If I stayed here, I might.
Goodnight!"</p>

<p>She started down the stairs. Cochrane said vexedly:</p>

<p>"Hold on! Confound it, I didn't know I was so transparent!
I'm sorry, Babs. Look! Tell me something for my
own good!"</p>

<p>Babs hesitated, and then said very cheerfully:</p>

<p>"You only see things the way a man sees them. This
show, this trip&mdash;this whole business doesn't thrill you because
you don't see it the way a woman would."</p>

<p>"Such as how? What does a woman see that I don't?"</p>

<p>"A woman," said Babs, "sees this planet as a place that
men and women will come to live on. To live on! You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
don't. You miss all the real implications of people actually
living here. But they're the things a woman sees first of
all."</p>

<p>Cochrane frowned.</p>

<p>"I'm not so conceited I can't listen to somebody else.
If you've got an idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not an idea," said Babs. "Just a reaction. And you
can't explain a reaction to somebody who hasn't had it.
Goodnight!"</p>

<p>She vanished down the stairs. Some time later, Cochrane
heard the extremely minute sound of a door closing
on one of the cabins three decks down in the space-ship.</p>

<p>He went back to his restless inspection of the night outside.
He tried to make sense of what Babs had said. He
failed altogether. In the end he settled in one of the over-elaborately
cushioned chairs that had made this ship so
attractive to deluded investors. He intended to think out
what Babs might have meant. She was, after all, the most
competent secretary he'd ever had, and he'd been <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'wrily'.">wryly</ins>
aware of how helpless he would be without her. Now he
tried painstakingly to imagine what changes in one's view
the inclusion of women among pioneers would involve. He
worked out some seemingly valid points. But it was not a
congenial mental occupation.</p>

<p>He fell asleep without realizing it, and was waked by
the sound of voices all about him. It was morning again,
and Johnny Simms was shouting boyishly at something he
saw outside.</p>

<p>"Get at it, boy!" he cried enthusiastically. "Grab him!
That's the way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cochrane opened his eyes. Johnny Simms gazed out
and down from a blister-port, waving his arms. His wife
Alicia looked out of the same port without seeming to
share his excited approval. Bell had dragged a camera
across the control-room and was in the act of focussing
it through a particular window.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Cochrane.</p>

<p>He struggled out of his chair. And Johnny Simms'
pleasure evaporated abruptly. He swore nastily, viciously,
at something outside the ship. His wife touched his arm
and spoke to him in a low tone. He turned furiously upon
her, mouthing foulnesses.</p>

<p>Cochrane was formidably beside him, and Johnny
Simms' expression of fury smoothed out instantly. He
looked pleasant and amiable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"The fight stopped," he explained offhandedly. "It was
a good fight. But one of the creatures wouldn't stay and
take his licking."</p>

<p>Alicia said steadily:</p>

<p>"There were some animals there. They looked rather
like bears, only they had enormous ears."</p>

<p>Cochrane looked at Johnny Simms with hot eyes. It
was absurd to be so chivalrous, perhaps, but he was enraged.
After an instant he turned away and went to the
port. The burned-over area was now only ashes. At its
edge, charcoal showed. And now he could see trees and
brushwood on beyond. The trees did not seem strange,
because no trees would have seemed familiar. The brush
did not impress him as exotic, because his experience with
actual plants was restricted to the artificial plants on television
sets and the artificially arranged plants on rooftops.
He hardly let his eyes dwell on the vegetation at all. He
searched for movement. He saw the moving furry rumps
of half a dozen unknown creatures as they dived into concealment
as if they had been frightened. He looked down
and could see the hull of the ship and two of the three
take-off fins on which it rested.</p>

<p>The airlock door was opening out. It swung wide. It
swung back against the hull.</p>

<p>"Holden's making some sort of test of the air," Cochrane
said shortly. "The animals were scared when the outside
door swung open. I'll see what he finds out."</p>

<p>He hurried down. He found Babs standing beside the
inner door of the airlock. She looked somehow pale. There
were two saucers of greenish soup-like stuff on the floor
at her feet. That would be, of course, the algae from the
air-purifying-system tanks.</p>

<p>"The algae were alive," said Babs. "Dr. Holden went
in the lock to try the air himself. He said he'd be very
careful."</p>

<p>For some obscure reason Cochrane felt ashamed. There
was a long, a desperately long wait. Then sounds of machinery.
The outer door closing. Small whistlings&mdash;compressed
air.</p>

<p>The inner door opened. Bill Holden came out of the
lock, his expression zestfully surprised.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jed! I tried the air. It's all right! At a guess,
maybe a little high in oxygen. But it feels wonderfully
good to breathe! And I can report that the trees are wood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and the green is <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'chlorophyl'.">chlorophyll</ins>, and this is an Earth-type
planet. That little smoky smell about is completely familiar&mdash;and
I'm taking that as an analysis. I'm going to take a
walk."</p>

<p>Cochrane found himself watching Babs' face. She looked
enormously relieved, but even Cochrane&mdash;who was looking
for something of the sort without realizing it&mdash;could
not read anything but relief in her expression. She did not,
for example, look admiring.</p>

<p>"I'll borrow one of Johnny Simms' guns," said Holden,
"and take a look around. It's either perfectly safe or we're
all dead anyhow. Frankly, I think it's safe. It feels right
outside, Jed! It honestly feels right!"</p>

<p>"I'll come with you," said Cochrane, "Jones and the
pilot are necessary if the ship's to get back to Earth. But
we're expendable."</p>

<p>He went back to the control-room. Johnny Simms zestfully
undertook to outfit them with arms. He made no
proposal to accompany them. In twenty minutes or so,
Cochrane and Holden went into the airlock and the door
closed. A light came on automatically, precisely like the
light in an electric refrigerator. Cochrane found his lips
twitching a little as the analogy came to him. Seconds later
the outer door opened, and they gazed down among the
branches of tall trees. Cochrane winced. There was no
railing and the height bothered him. But Holden swung
out the sling. He and Cochrane descended, dangling,
down fifty feet of unscarred, shining, metal hull.</p>

<p>The ground was still hot underfoot. Holden cast off the
sling and moved toward cooler territory with an undignified
haste. Cochrane followed him.</p>

<p>The smells were absolutely commonplace. Scorched
wood. Smokiness. There were noises. Occasional cracklings
from burned tree-trunks not wholly consumed. High-pitched,
shrill musical notes. And in and among the smells
there was an astonishing freshness in the feel of the air.
Cochrane was especially apt to notice it because he had
lived in a city back on Earth, and had spent four days in
the moon-rocket, and then had breathed the Lunar City
air for eighteen days more and had just come from the
space-ship whose air was distinctly of the canned variety.</p>

<p>He did not notice the noise of the sling again in motion
behind him. He was all eyes and ears and acute awareness
of the completely strange environment. He was the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
conscious of a general strangeness because he was so completely
an urban product. Yet he and Holden were vastly
less aware of the real strangeness about them than men of
previous generations would have been. They did not notice
the oddity of croaking sounds, like frogs, coming from
the tree-tops. When they had threaded their way among
leaning charred poles and came to green stuff underfoot
and merely toasted foliage all around, Cochrane heard a
sweet, high-pitched trilling which came from a half-inch
hole in the ground. But he was not astonished by the place
from which the trilling came. He was astonished at the
sound itself.</p>

<p>There was a cry behind them.</p>

<p><i>"Mr. Cochrane! Doctor Holden!"</i></p>

<p>They swung about. And there was Babs on the ground,
just disentangling herself from the sling. She had followed
them out, after waiting until they had left the airlock and
could not protest.</p>

<p>Cochrane swore to himself. But when Babs joined them
breathlessly, after a hopping run over the hot ground, he
said only:</p>

<p>"Fancy meeting you here!"</p>

<p>"<i>I&mdash;I couldn't resist it</i>," said Babs in breathless apology.
"And you do have guns. It's safe enough&mdash;oh, look!"</p>

<p>She stared at a bush which was covered with pale purple
flowers. Small creatures hovered in the air about it.
She approached it and exclaimed again at the sweetness of
its scent. Cochrane and Holden joined her in admiration.</p>

<p>In a sense they were foolishly unwary. This was completely
strange territory. It could have contained anything.
Earlier explorers would have approached every bush with
caution and moved over every hilltop with suspicion, anticipating
deadly creatures, unparalleled monsters, and
exotic and peculiar circumstances designed to entrap the
unprepared. Earlier explorers, of course, would probably
have had advice from famous men to prepare them for
all possible danger.</p>

<p>But this was a valley between snow-clad mountains.
The river that ran down its length was fed by glaciers.
This was a temperate climate. The trees were either coniferous
or something similar, and the vegetation grew
well but not with the frenzy of a tropic region. There
were fruits here and there. Later, to be sure, they would
prove to be mostly astringent and unpalatable. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
broad-leafed, low-growing plants which would eventually
turn out to be possessed of soft-fleshed roots which were
almost unanimously useless for human purposes. There
were even some plants with thorns and spines upon them.
But they encountered no danger.</p>

<p>By and large, wild animals everywhere are ferocious
only when desperate. No natural setting can permanently
be so deadly that human being will be attacked immediately
they appear. An area in which peril is continuous
is one in which there is so much killing that there is no
food-supply left to maintain its predators. On the whole,
there is simply a limit to how dangerous any place can be.
Dangerous beasts have to be relatively rare, or they will
not have enough to eat, when they will thin out until
they are relatively rare and do have enough to eat.</p>

<p>So the three explorers moved safely, though their boldness
was that of ignorance, below gigantic trees nearly as
tall as the space-ship standing on end. They saw a small
furry biped, some twelve inches tall, which waddled insanely
in the exact line of their progress and with no apparent
hope of outdistancing them. They saw a gauzy
creature with incredibly spindly legs. It flew from one
tree-trunk to another, clinging to rough bark on each in
turn. Once they came upon a small animal which looked
at them with enormous, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'panic-striken'.">panic-stricken</ins> blue eyes and then
fled with a sinuous gait on legs so short that they seemed
mere flippers. It dived into a hole and vanished.</p>

<p>But they came out to clear space. They could look for
miles and miles. There was a savannah of rolling soil
which gradually sloped down to a swift-running river. The
grass&mdash;if it was grass&mdash;was quite green, but it had multitudes
of tiny rose-colored flowers down the central rib
of each leaf. Nearby it seemed the color of Earth-grass,
but it faded imperceptibly into an incredible old-rose tint
in the distance. The mountain-scarps on either side of the
valley were sheer and tall. There was a great stony spur
reaching out above the lowland, and there was forest at
its top and bare brown stone dropping two thousand feet
sheer. And up the valley, where it narrowed, a waterfall
leaped out from the cliff and dropped hundreds of feet in
an arc of purest white, until it was lost to view behind
tree-tops.</p>

<p>They looked. They stared. Cochrane was a television
producer, and Holden was a psychiatrist, and Babs was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
highly efficient secretary. They did not make scientific observations.
The ecological system of the valley escaped
their notice. They weren't qualified to observe that the
flying things around seemed mostly to be furry instead of
feathered, and that insects seemed few and huge and fragile,&mdash;and
they did not notice that most of the plants appeared
to be deciduous, so indicating that this planet had
pronounced seasons. But Holden said:</p>

<p>"Up in Greenland there's a hospital on a cliff like that.
People with delusions of grandeur sometimes get cured
just by looking at something that's so much greater and
more splendid than they are. I'd like to see a hospital up
yonder!"</p>

<p>Babs said, shining-eyed:</p>

<p>"A city could be built in this valley. Not a tall city,
with gray streets and gardens on the roofs. This could be
a nice little city like people used to have. There would be
little houses, all separate, and there'd be grass all around
and people could pluck flowers if they wanted to, to take
inside.... There could be families here, and homes&mdash;not
living-quarters!"</p>

<p>Cochrane said nothing. He was envious of the others.
They saw, and they dreamed according to their natures.
Cochrane somehow felt forlorn. Presently he said
depressedly:</p>

<p>"We'll go back to the ship. You can work out your
woman's viewpoint stuff with Bell, Babs. He'll write it, or
you can give it to Alicia to put over when we go on the
air."</p>

<p>Babs made no reply. The absence of comment was almost
pointed. Cochrane realized that she wouldn't do it,
though he couldn't see why.</p>

<p>They did go back to the ship. Cochrane sent Babs and
Holden up the sling, first, while he waited down below.
It was a singular sensation to stand there. He was the only
human being afoot on a planet the size of Earth or larger,
at the foot of a cliff of metal which was the space-ship's
hull. He had a weapon in his hand, and it should defend
him from anything. But he felt very lonely.</p>

<p>The sling came down for him. He felt sick at heart as
it lifted him. He had an overwhelming conviction of incompetence,
though he could not detail the reasons. The
rope hauled him up, swaying, to the dizzy height of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
air-lock door. He could not feel elated. He was partly responsible
for humankind's greatest achievement to date.
But he had not quite the viewpoint that would let him
enjoy its contemplation.</p>

<p>The ground quivered very faintly as he rose. It was
not an earthquake. It was merely a temblor, such as anyone
would expect to feel occasionally with six smoking
volcanic cones in view. The green stuff all around was proof
that it could be disregarded.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_SEVEN" id="CHAPTER_SEVEN"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>


<p>In the United States, some two-hundred-odd light-years
away, it happened to be Tuesday. On this Tuesday,
the broadcast from the stars was sponsored by Harvey's,
the national men's clothing chain. Harvey's advertising
department preferred discussion-type shows, because differences
of opinion in the shows proper led so neatly into
their tag-line. "You can disagree about anything but the
quality of a Harvey suit! That's Superb!"</p>

<p>Therefore the broadcast after the landing of the ship
on the volcanic planet was partly commercial, and partly
pictures and reports from the Spaceways expedition, and
partly queries and comments by big-name individuals on
Earth. Inevitably there was Dabney. And Dabney was
neurotic.</p>

<p>He did his best to make a shambles of everything.</p>

<p>The show started promptly enough at the beginning.
There was a two-minute film-strip of business-suited puppets
marching row on row, indicating the enormous popularity
of Harvey's suits. Then a fast minute hill-billy
puppet-show about two feuding mountaineers who found
they couldn't possibly retain their enmity when they found
themselves in agreement on the quality of Harvey suits.
"That's Superb!" The commercial ended with a choral
dance of madly enthusiastic miniature figures, dancing
while they lustily sang the theme-song, "You can disagree,
yes siree, you can disagree, About anything, indeed everything,
you and me, But you can't, no you can't disagree,
About the strictly super, extra super, Qualitee of a Har-ve-e-e-e
suit! That's superb!"</p>

<p>And thereupon the television audience of several continents
saw the faded-in image of mankind's first starship,
poised upon its landing-fins among trees more splendid
than even television shows had ever pictured before.
The camera panned slowly, and showed such open spaces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
as very few humans had ever seen unencumbered by buildings,
and mountains of a grandeur difficult for most people
to believe in.</p>

<p>The scene cut to the space-ship's control-room and Al
the pilot acted briskly as the leader of an exploration-party
just returned&mdash;though he actually hadn't left the
ship. He introduced Jamison, wearing improvised leggings
and other trappings appropriate to an explorer in wilderness.
Jamison began to extrapolate from his observations
out the control-room port, adding film-clips for authority.</p>

<p>Smoothly and hypnotically, he pictured the valley as
the ship descended the last few thousand feet, and told of
the human colony to be founded in this vast and hospitable
area just explored. Mountainside hotels for star-tourists
would look down upon a scene of tranquility and cozy
spaciousness. This would be the first human outpost in the
stars. In the other valleys of this magnificent world there
would be pasture-lands, and humankind would again begin
to regard meat as a normal and not-extravagant part of
its diet&mdash;on this planet, certainly! There were minerals beyond
doubt, and water-power. The estimate was that at
least the equivalent of the Asian continent had been made
available for human occupation. And this splendid addition
to the resources of humanity ...</p>

<p>The second commercial cut Jamison off. Naturally. The
sponsor was paying for time. So for Jamison was substituted
the other fiction about the poor young man who
found himself envied by the board of directors of the firm
which employed him. His impeccable attire caused him to
be promoted to vice-president without any question of
whether or not he could fill the job. Because, of course,
he wore a Harvey suit.</p>

<p>Alicia Keith showed herself on the screen and gave the
woman's viewpoint as written about by Bell. She talked
pleasantly about how it felt to move about on a planet
never before trodden by human beings. She was interrupted
by the pictured face of the lady editor of Joint
Networks' feminine programs, who asked sweetly:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Alicia, what do you think the attainment of
the stars will mean to the Average American housewife
in the immediate future? Right now?"</p>

<p>Then Dabney came on. His appearance was fitted into
the sequence from Lunar City, and his gestures were extravagant
as anybody's gestures will be where their hands
and arms weigh so small a fraction of Earth-normal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish," said Dabney impressively, "to congratulate
the men who have so swiftly adapted my discovery of
faster-than-light travel to practical use. I am overwhelmed
at having been able to achieve a scientific triumph which
in time will mean that mankind's future stretches endlessly
and splendidly into the future!"</p>

<p>Here there was canned applause. Dabney held up his
hand for attention. He thought. Visibly.</p>

<p>"But," he said urgently, "I admit that I am disturbed
by the precipitancy of the action that has been taken. I
feel as if I were like some powerful djinni giving gifts
which the recipients may use without thought."</p>

<p>More canned applause, inserted because he had given
instructions for it whenever he paused. The communicator-operator
at Luna City took pleasure in following instructions
exactly. Dabney held up his hand again. Again
he performed feats of meditation in plain view.</p>

<p>"At the moment," he said anxiously, "as the author of
this truly magnificent achievement, I have to use the same
intellect which produced it, to examine the possibility of
its ill-advised use. May not explorers&mdash;who took off without
my having examined their plans and precautions&mdash;may
not over-hasty users of my gift to humanity do harm?
May they not find bacteria the human body cannot resist?
May they not bring back plagues and epidemics? Have
they prepared themselves to use my discovery only for
the benefit of mankind? Or have they been precipitous?
I shall have to apply myself to the devising of methods
by which my discovery&mdash;made so that Humanity might
attain hitherto undreamed-of-heights&mdash;I shall have to devise
means by which it will be truly a blessing to mankind!"</p>

<p>Dabney, of course, had tasted the limelight. All the
world considered him the greatest scientist of all time&mdash;except,
of course, the people who knew something about
science. But the first actual voyagers in space had become
immediately greater heroes than himself. It was intolerable
to Dabney to be restricted to taking bows on programs
in which they starred. So he wrote a star part for himself.</p>

<p>The bearded biologist who followed him was to have
lectured on the pictures and reports forwarded to him beforehand.
But he could not ignore so promising a lead to
show how much he knew. So he lectured authoritatively
on the danger of extra-terrestrial disease-producing
organisms being introduced on Earth. He painted a lurid
picture, quoting from the history of pre-sanitation epidemics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
He wound up with a specific prophecy of something
like the Black Death of the middle ages as lurking among
the stars to decimate humanity. He was a victim of the
well-known authority-trauma which affects some people
on television when they think millions of other people are
listening to them. They depart madly from their scripts to
try to say something startling enough to justify all the
attention they're getting.</p>

<p>The broadcast ended with a sentimental live commercial
in which a dazzlingly beautiful girl melted into the arms
of the worthy young man she had previously scorned. She
found him irresistible when she noticed that he was wearing
a suit she instantly knew by its quality could only come
from Harvey's.</p>

<p>On the planet of glaciers and volcanoes, Holden fumed.</p>

<p>"Dammit!" he protested. "They talk like we're lepers!
Like if we ever come back we'll be carriers of some monstrous
disease that will wipe out the human race! As a
matter of fact, we're no more likely to catch an extra-terrestrial
disease than to catch wry-neck from sick
chickens!"</p>

<p>"That broadcast's nothing to worry about," said Cochrane.</p>

<p>"But it is!" insisted Holden. "Dabney and that fool
biologist presented space-travel as a reason for panic! They
could have every human being on Earth scared to death
we'll bring back germs and everybody'll die of the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'roup'.">croup</ins>!"</p>

<p>Cochrane grinned.</p>

<p>"Good publicity&mdash;if we needed it! Actually, they've
boosted the show. From now on every presentation has a
dramatic kick it didn't have before. Now everybody will
feel suspense waiting for the next show. Has Jamison got
the Purple Death on the Planet of Smoky Hilltops? Will
darling Alicia Keith break out in green spots next time
we watch her on the air? Has Captain Al of the star-roving
space-ship breathed in spores of the Swelling Fungus? Are
the space-travellers doomed? Tune in on our next broadcast
and see! My dear Bill, if we weren't signed up for
sponsors' fees, I'd raise our prices after this trick!"</p>

<p>Holden looked unconvinced. Cochrane said kindly:</p>

<p>"Don't worry! I could turn off the panic tomorrow&mdash;as
much panic as there is. Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and
Fallowe had a proposal they set great store by. They
wanted to parcel out a big contest for a name for mankind's
second planet. They had regional sponsors lined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
up. It would have been worldwide! Advertisers were drooling
over the prospect of people proposing names for this
planet on box-tops! They were planning five million prize-money&mdash;and
who'd be afraid of us then? But I turned it
down because we haven't got a helicopter. We couldn't
stage enough different shows from this planet to keep it
going the minimum six weeks for a contest like that. Instead,
we're taking off in a couple of hours. Jones agrees.
The astronomers back home have picked out another Sol-type
star that ought to have planets. We're going to run
over and see what pickings we can find. Not too far&mdash;only
twenty-some light-years!"</p>

<p>He regarded Holden quizzically to see how the last
phases affected him. Holden didn't notice it.</p>

<p>"A contest&mdash;It doesn't make sense!"</p>

<p>"I know it isn't sense!" said Cochrane. "It's public-relations!
I'm beginning to get my self-respect back. I see
now that a space-exploration job is only as good as its
public-relations man!"</p>

<p>He went zestfully to find Babs to tell her to leave the
communicator-set and let queries go unanswered as a matter
of simple business policy.</p>

<p>The sling which swung out of the airlock now became
busy. They had landed on this planet, and they were
going to leave it, and there had been a minimum of actual
contact with its soil. So Jamison took his leggings&mdash;put
on for the show&mdash;and he and Bell went down to the ground
and foraged through the woods. Jamison carried one of
Johnny Simms' guns, which he regarded with acute suspicion,
and Bell carried cameras. They photographed trees
and underbrush, first as atmosphere and then with fanatic
attention to leaves and fruits or flowers. Bell got pictures
of one of the small, furry bipeds that Cochrane and Holden
had spied when Babs was with them. He got a picture
of what he believed to be a spider-web&mdash;it was thicker and
heavier and huger than any web on Earth&mdash;and rather
fearfully looked for the monster that could string thirty-foot
cables as thick as fishing-twine. Then he found that
it was not a snare at all. It was a construction at whose
center something undiscoverable had made a nest, with
eggs in it. Some creature had made an unapproachable
home for itself where its young would not be assailed by
predators.</p>

<p>Al, the pilot, went out of the lock and descended to
the ground and went as far as the edge of the ash-ring. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
he did not go any farther. He wandered about unhappily,
pretending that he did not want to go into the woods. He
tried to appear quite content to view half-burnt trees for
his experience of the first extra-terrestrial planet on which
men had landed. He did kick up some pebbles&mdash;water-rounded&mdash;and
one of them had flecks of what looked like
gold in it. Al regarded it excitedly, and then thought of
freight-rates. But he did scrabble for more. Presently he
had a pocket-full of small stones which would be regarded
with rapture by his nieces and nephews because they had
come from the stars. Actually, they were quite commonplace
minerals. The flecks of what looked like gold were
only iron pyrates.</p>

<p>Jones did not leave the ship. He was puttering. Nor
Alicia. Holden urged her to take a walk, and she said
quietly:</p>

<p>"Johnny's out with a gun. He's hunting. I don't like
to be with Johnny when he may be disappointed."</p>

<p>She smiled, and Holden sourly went away. There had
been no particular consequences of Johnny Simms' inability
to remember what was right and what was wrong. But
Holden felt like a normal man about men whose wives
look patient. Even psychiatrists feel that it is somehow
disreputable to illtreat a woman who doesn't fight back.
This attitude is instinctive. It is what is called the fine,
deep-rooted impulse to chivalry which is one of the prides
of modern culture.</p>

<p>Holden settled dourly down at the communicator to
get an outgoing call to Earth, when there were some hundreds
of incoming calls backed up. By sheer obstinacy and
bad manners he made it. He got a connection to a hospital
where he was known, and he talked to its bacteriologist.
The bacteriologist was competent, but not yet famous.
With Holden giving honest guesses at the color of
the sunlight, and its probable ultra-violet content, and with
careful estimates of the exactness with which burning vegetation
here smelled like Earth-plants, they arrived at imprecise
but common sense conclusions. Of the hundreds of
thousands of possible organic compounds, only so many
actually took part in the life-processes of creatures on
Earth. Yet there were hundreds of thousands of species prepared
to make use of anything usable. If the sunlight and
temperature of the two worlds were similar, it was somewhat
more than likely that the same chemical compounds
would be used by living things on both. So that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
could be micro-organisms on the new planet which could
be harmful. But on the other hand, either they would be
familiar in the toxins they produced&mdash;and human bodies
could resist them&mdash;or else they would be new compounds
to which humans would react allergically. Basically, then,
if anybody on the ship developed hives, they had reason
to be frightened. But so long as nobody sneezed or broke
out in welts, their lives were probably safe.</p>

<p>This comforting conclusion took a long time to work
out. Meanwhile Babs and Cochrane had swung down to
the ground and went hiking. Cochrane was armed as before,
though he had no experience as a marksman. In television
shows he had directed the firing of weapons shooting
blank charges&mdash;cut to a minimum so they wouldn't
blast the mikes. He knew what motions to go through,
but nothing else.</p>

<p>They did not explore in the same direction as their first
excursion. The ship was to take off presently, as soon as
this planet had turned enough for the space-ship's nose to
point nearly in the direction of their next target. They had
two hours for exploration.</p>

<p>They came upon something which lay still across their
path, like a great serpent. Cochrane looked at it startledly.
Then he saw that the round, glistening seeming snake was
fastened to the ground by rootlets. It was a plant which
grew like a creeper, absorbing nourishment from a vast
root-area. Somewhere, no doubt, it would rear upward
and spread out leaves to absorb the sun's light. It used,
in a way, the principle of those lateral wells which in dry
climates gather water too scarce to collect in merely vertical
holes.</p>

<p>They went on and on, admiring and amazed. All about
them were curiosities of adaptation, freaks of ecological
adjustment, marvels of symbiotic cooperation. A botanist
would have swooned with joy at the material all about.
A biologist would have babbled happily. Babs and Cochrane
admired without information. They walked interestedly
but unawed among the unparalleled. Back on Earth
they knew as much as most people about nature&mdash;practically
nothing at all. Babs had never seen any wild plants
before. She was fascinated by what she saw, and exclaimed
at everything. But she did not realize a fraction of the
marvels on which her eyes rested. On the whole, she
survived.</p>

<p>"It's a pity we haven't got a helicopter," Cochrane said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
regretfully. "If we could fly around from place to place,
and send back pictures ... We can't do it in the ship ...
It would burn more fuel than we've got."</p>

<p>Babs wrinkled her forehead.</p>

<p>"Doctor Holden's badly worried because we can't make
as alluring a picture as he'd like."</p>

<p>Cochrane halted, to watch something which was flat
like a disk of gray-green flesh and which moved slowly out
of their path with disquieting writhing motions. It vanished,
and he said:</p>

<p>"Yes. Bill's an honest man, even if he is a psychiatrist.
He wants desperately to do something for the poor devils
back home who're so pitifully frustrated. There are tens of
millions of men who can't hope for anything better than to
keep the food and shelter supply intact for themselves and
their families. They can't even pretend to hope for more
than that. There isn't more than so much to go around.
But Bill wants to give them hope. He figures that without
hope the world will turn madhouse in another generation.
It will."</p>

<p>"You're trying to do something about that!" said Babs
quickly. "Don't you think you're offering hope to everybody
back on Earth?"</p>

<p>"No!" snapped Cochrane. "I'm not trying anything so
abstract as furnishing hope to a frustrated humanity! Nobody
can supply an abstraction! Nobody can accomplish
an abstraction! Everything that's actually done is specific
and real! Maybe you can find abstract qualities in it after
it's done, but I'm a practical man! I'm not trying to
produce an improved psychological climate, suitable for
debilitated psychos! I'm trying to get a job done!"</p>

<p>"I've wondered," admitted Babs, "what the job is."</p>

<p>Cochrane grimaced.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't believe it, Babs."</p>

<p>There was an odd quivering underfoot. Trees shook.
There was no other peculiarity anywhere. Nothing fell. No
rocks rolled. In a valley among volcanoes, where the smoke
from no less than six cones could be seen at once, temblors
would not do damage. What damage mild shakings could
do would have been done centuries since.</p>

<p>Babs said uneasily:</p>

<p>"That feels&mdash;queer, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Cochrane nodded. But just as he and Babs had never
been conditioned to be afraid of animals, they had been
conditioned by air-travel at home and space-travel to here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
against alarm at movements of their surroundings. Temblors
were evidently frequent at this place. Trees were
anchored against them as against prevailing winds in exposed
situations. Landslides did not remain poised to fall.
Really unstable slopes had been shaken down long ago.</p>

<p>"I wish we had a helicopter," Cochrane repeated. "The
look of the mountains as we came down, with glaciers between
the smoking cones&mdash;that was good show-stuff! We
could have held interest here until we worked that naming
contest. We could use the extra capital that would bring in!
As it is, we've got to move on with practically nothing accomplished.
The trouble is that I didn't think we would
succeed as we have! Heaven knows I could have gotten
helicopters!"</p>

<p>He helped her up a small steep incline, where rock
protruded from a hillside.</p>

<p>The ground trembled again. Not alarmingly, but Babs'
hold of his hand tightened a little. They continued to climb.
They came out atop a small bare prominence which rose
above the forest. Here they could see over the treetops in
a truly extensive view. The mountains all about were
clearly visible. Some were ten and some twenty miles away.
Some, still farther, were barely visible in the thin haze of
distance. But there was a thick pall of smoke hovering
about one of the farthest. It was mushroom-shaped. At
one time in human history, it would have seemed typically
a volcanic cloud. To Cochrane and Babs, it was typically
the cloud of an atomic explosion.</p>

<p>The ground shook sharply underfoot. Babs staggered.</p>

<p>Flying things rose from the forests in swarms. They
hovered and darted and flapped above the tree-tops. Temblors
did not alarm the creatures of the valley. But ground-shocks
like this last were another matter.</p>

<p>A great tree, rearing above its fellows, toppled slowly.
With ripping, tearing noises, it bent sedately toward the
smoking, far-away mountain. It crashed thunderously down
upon smaller trees. There were other rending noises. The
flying things rose higher, seeming agitated. Echoes sounded
in the ears of the two atop the hill.</p>

<p>There was another sharp shock. Babs gave a little,
inarticulate cry. She pointed.</p>

<p>There was much smoke in the distance. Over the far-away
cone, which was indistinct in the smoke of its own
making&mdash;over the edge of the distant mountains a glare appeared.
It was a thin line of bright white light. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
infinite deliberation it began to creep down the slanting,
blessedly remote mountainside.</p>

<p>The ground seemed to shift abruptly, and then shift
back. Across and down the valley, five miles away, a portion
of the stony wall detached itself and slid downward in
seeming slow motion. Two more great trees made ripping
sounds. One crashed. There was an enormous darkness
above one part of the sky. Its under side glowed from fires
as of hell, in the crater beneath it. There were sparkings
above the mountaintop.</p>

<p>Very oddly indeed, the sky overhead was peacefully
blue. But at the horizon a sheet of fire rolled down mile-long
slopes. It seemed to move with infinite deliberation,
but to move visibly at such a distance it must have been
traveling like an express-train. It must have been unthinkably
hot, glaring-white molten stone, thin as water, pouring
downward in a flood of fire.</p>

<p>There was no longer a sensation of the ground trembling
underfoot. Now the noticeable sensation was when the
ground was still. Temblors were practically continuous.
There were distinct sharp impacts, as of violent blows
nearby.</p>

<p>Babs stared, fascinated. She glanced up at Cochrane.
His skin was white. There were beads of sweat on his forehead.</p>

<p>"We're safe here, aren't we?" she asked, scared.</p>

<p>"I think so. But I'm not going to take you through
falling trees while this is going on! There's another tree
down! I'm worrying about the ship! If it topples&mdash;."</p>

<p>She looked at the nose of the space-ship, gleaming silver
metal, rising from the trees about the landing-spot it had
burned clear. A third of its length was visible.</p>

<p>"If it topples," said Cochrane, "we'll never be able to
take off. It has to point up to lift."</p>

<p>Babs looked from the ship to him, and back again. Then
her eyes went fearfully to the remote mountain. Rumblings
came from it now. They were not loud. They were hardly
more than dull growlings, at the lower limit of audible
pitch. They were like faint and distant thunder. There were
flashings like lightning in the cloud which now enveloped
the mountain's top.</p>

<p>Cochrane made an indescribable small sound. He stared
at the ship. As explosion-waves passed over the ground, a
faint, unanimous movement of the treetops became visible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
It seemed to Cochrane that the space-ship wavered as if
about to fall from its upright position.</p>

<p>It was not designed to stand such violence as a fall
would imply. Its hull would be dented or rent. It was at
least possible that its fuel-store would detonate. But even if
its fall were checked by still-standing trees about it, it could
never take off again. The eight humans of its company
could never juggle it back to a vertical position. Rocket-thrust
would merely push it in the direction its nose
pointed. Toppled, its rocket-thrust would merely shove it
blindly over stones and trees and to destruction.</p>

<p>The ship swayed again. Visibly. Ground-waves made
its weight have the effect of blows. Part of its foundation
rested on almost-visible stone, only feet below the ground-level.
But one of the landing-fins rested on humus. As the
shocks passed, that fin-foot sank into the soft soil. The
space-ship leaned perceptibly.</p>

<p>Flying creatures darted back and forth above the tree-tops.
Miles away, insensate violence reigned. Clouds of
dust and smoke shot miles into the air, and half a mountainside
glowed white-hot, and there was the sound of long-continued
thunder, and the ground shook and quivered....</p>

<p>There were movements nearby. A creature with yellow
fur and the shape of a bear with huge ears came padding
out of the forest. It swarmed up the bare stone of the hill
on which Babs and Cochrane stood.</p>

<p>It ignored them. Halfway up the unwooded part of the
hill, it stopped and made plaintive, high-pitched noises.
Other creatures came. Many had come while the man and
girl were too absorbed to notice. Now two more of the
large animals came out into the open and climbed the hill.</p>

<p>Babs said shakily:</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;think they'll&mdash;do you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a nearer roaring. The space-ship leaned, and
leaned.... Cochrane's lips tensed.</p>

<p>The space-ship's rockets bellowed and a storm of hurtling
smoke flashed up around it. It lifted, staggering as its
steering-jets tried frantically to swing its lower parts underneath
its mass. It lurched violently, and the rockets flamed
terribly. It lifted again. Its tail was higher than the trees,
but it did not point straight up. It surged horribly across
the top of the forest, leaving a vast flash of flaming vegetation
behind it. Then it steadied, and aimed skyward and
climbed....</p>

<p>Then it was not. Obviously the Dabney field booster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
had been flashed on to get the ship out to space. The ship
had vanished into emptiness.</p>

<p>The Dabney field had flicked it some hundred and
seventy-odd light-years from Earth's moon in the flicker of
a heart-beat. It might have gone that far again. Whoever
was in it had had no choice but to take off, and no way to
take off without suicidal use of fuel in any other way.</p>

<p>Cochrane looked at where the ship had vanished. Seconds
passed. There came the thunderclap of air closing the
vacuum the ship's disappearance had left.</p>

<p>There were squealings behind the pair on the hilltop.
Eight of the huge yellow beasts were out in the open, now.
Tiny, furry biped animals waddled desperately to get out
of their way. Smaller creatures scuttled here and there. A
sinuous creature with fur but no apparent legs writhed its
way upward. But all the creatures were frightened. They
observed an absolute truce, under the overmastering
greater fear of nature.</p>

<p>Far away, the volcano on the skyline boomed and
flashed and emitted monstrous clouds of smoke. The shining,
incandescent lava on its flanks glared across the
glaciers.</p>

<p>Babs gasped suddenly. She realized the situation in
which she and <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'Cochrone'.">Cochrane</ins> had been left.</p>

<p>Shivering, she pressed close to him as the distant black
smoke-cloud spread toward the center of the sky.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_EIGHT" id="CHAPTER_EIGHT"></a>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>


<p>Before sunset, they reached the area of ashes
where the ship had stood. Cochrane was sure that if anybody
else had been left <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'behind'.">behind besides</ins> themselves, the landing-place
was an inevitable rendezvous. Only three members of the
ship's company had been inside when Babs and Cochrane
left to stroll for the two hours astronomers on Earth had
set as a waiting-period. Jones had been in the ship, and
Holden, and Alicia Simms. Everybody else had been exploring.
Their attitude had been exactly that of sight-seers
and tourists. But they could have gotten back before the
take-off.</p>

<p>Apparently they had. Nobody seemed to have returned
to the burned-over space since the ship's departure. The
blast of the rockets had erased all previous tracks, but still
there was a thin layer of ash resettled over the clearing.
Footprints would have been visible in it. Anybody remaining
would have come here. Nobody had. Babs and Cochrane
were left alone.</p>

<p>There were still temblors, but the sharper shocks no
longer came. There was conflagration in the wood, where
the lurching ship had left a long fresh streak of forest-fire.
The two castaways stared at the round, empty landing-place.
Overhead, the blue sky turned yellow&mdash;but where
the smoke from the eruption rose, the sky early became a
brownish red&mdash;and presently the yellow faded to gold. Unburned
green foliage all about was singularly beautiful in
that golden glow. But it was more beautiful still as the sky
turned rose-pink and then carmine in turn, and then crimson
from one horizon to the other save where the volcanic
smoke-cloud marred the color. Then the east darkened,
and became a red so deep as to be practically black, and
unfamiliar bright stars began to peep through it.</p>

<p>Before darkness was complete, Cochrane dragged burning
branches from the edge of the new fire&mdash;the heat was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
searing&mdash;and built a new and smaller fire in the place
where the ship had been.</p>

<p>"This isn't for warmth," he explained briefly, "but so
we'll have light if we need it. And it isn't likely that animals
will be anything but afraid of it."</p>

<p>He went off to drag charred masses of burnable stuff
from the burned-out first forest fire. He built a sort of
rampart in the very center of the clearing. He brought great
heaps of scorched wood. He did not know how much was
needed to keep the fire going until dawn.</p>

<p>When he finished, Babs was silently at work trying to
find out how to keep the fire going. The burning parts had
to be kept together. One branch, burning alone, died out.
Two red-hot brands in contact kept each other alight.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry we haven't anything to eat," Cochrane told
her.</p>

<p>"I'm not hungry," she assured him. "What are we going
to do now?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to do until morning." Unconsciously,
Cochrane looked grim. "Then there'll be plenty. Food, for
one thing. We don't know, actually, whether or not there's
anything really edible on this planet&mdash;for us. It could be
that there are fruits or possibly stalks or leaves that would
be nourishing. Only&mdash;we don't know which is which. We
have to be careful. We might pick something like poison
ivy!"</p>

<p>Babs said:</p>

<p>"But the ship will come back!"</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Cochrane. "But it may take them
some time to find us. This is a pretty big planet, you know."</p>

<p>He estimated his supply of burnable stuff. He improved
the rampart he had made at first. Babs stared at him. After
four or five minutes he stepped back.</p>

<p>"You can lean against this," he explained. "You can
watch the fire quite comfortably. And it's a sort of wall.
The fire will light one side of you and the wall will feel
comforting behind you when you get sleepy."</p>

<p>Babs nodded. She swallowed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;think I see what you mean when you say they may
have trouble finding us, because this planet is so large."</p>

<p>Cochrane nodded reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Of course there's this burned-off space for a marker,"
he observed cheerfully. "But it could take several days for
them to see it."</p>

<p>Babs swallowed again. She said carefully:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"The&mdash;ship can't hover like a helicopter, to search. You
said so. It doesn't have fuel enough. They can't really
search for us at all! The only way to make a real search
would be to go back to Earth and&mdash;bring back helicopters
and fuel for them and men to fly them.... Isn't that right?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. But we do have to figure on a matter
of&mdash;well&mdash;two or three days as a possibility."</p>

<p>Babs moistened her lips and he said quickly:</p>

<p>"I did a show once about some miners lost in a wilderness.
A period show. In it, they knew that part of their
food was poisoned. They didn't know what. They had to
have all their food. And of course they didn't have laboratories
with which to test for poison."</p>

<p>Babs eyed him oddly.</p>

<p>"They bandaged their arms," said Cochrane, "and put
scraps of the different foodstuffs under the bandages. The
one that was poisonous showed. It affected the skin. Like
an allergy-test. I'll try that trick in the morning when
there's light to pick samples by. There are berries and stuff.
There must be fruits. A few hours should test them."</p>

<p>Babs said without intonation:</p>

<p>"And we can watch what the animals eat."</p>

<p>Cochrane nodded gravely. Animals on Earth can live
on things that&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;humans do not find satisfying.
Grass, for example. But it was good for Babs to
think of cheering things right now. There would be plenty
of discouragement to contemplate later.</p>

<p>There was a flicker of brightness in the sky. Presently
the earth quivered. Something made a plaintive, "<i>waa-waa-waaaaa</i>!"
sound off in the night. Something else made a
noise like the tinkling of bells. There was an abstracted
hooting presently, which now was nearby and now was far
away, and once they heard something which was exactly
like the noise of water running into a pool. But the source
of that particular burbling moved through the dark wood
beyond the clearing.</p>

<p>It was not wholly dark where they were, even aside
from their own small fire. The burning trees in the departing
ship's rocket-trail sent up a column of white which
remaining flames illuminated. The remarkably primitive
camp Cochrane had made looked like a camp on a tiny
snow-field, because of the ashes.</p>

<p>"We've got to think about shelter," said Babs presently,
very quietly indeed. "If there are glaciers, there must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
winter here. If there is winter, we have to find out which
animals we can eat, and how to store them."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" protested Cochrane. "That's looking too far
ahead!"</p>

<p>Babs clasped her hands together. It could have been to
keep their trembling from being seen. Cochrane was regarding
her face. She kept that under admirable control.</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked Babs. "On the broadcast Mr. Jamison
said that there was as much land here as on all the continent
of Asia. Maybe he exaggerated. Say there's only as much
land not ice-covered as there is in South America. It's all
forest and plain and&mdash;uninhabited." She moistened her lips,
but her voice was very steady. "If all of South America
was uninhabited, and there were two people lost in it,
and nobody knew where they were&mdash;how long would it
take to find them?"</p>

<p>"It would be a matter of luck," admitted Cochrane.</p>

<p>"If the ship comes back, it can't hover to look for us.
There isn't fuel enough. It couldn't spot us from space if
it went in an orbit like a space platform. By the time they
could get help&mdash;they wouldn't even be sure we were alive.
If we can't count on being found right away, this burned-over
place will be green again. In two or three weeks they
couldn't find it anyhow."</p>

<p>Cochrane fidgeted. He had worked out all this for himself.
He'd been disturbed at having to tell it, or even admit
it to Babs. Now she said in a constrained voice:</p>

<p>"If men came to this planet and built a city and hunted
for us, it might still be a hundred years before anybody
happened to come into this valley. Looking for us would
be worse than looking for a needle in a haystack. I don't
think we're going to be found again."</p>

<p>Cochrane was silent. He felt guiltily relieved that he
did not have to break this news to Babs. Most men have
an instinctive feeling that a woman will blame them for
bad news they hear.</p>

<p>A long time later, Babs said as quietly as before:</p>

<p>"Johnny Simms asked me to come along while he went
hunting. I didn't. At least I&mdash;I'm not cast away with him!"</p>

<p>Cochrane said gruffly:</p>

<p>"Don't sit there and brood! Try to get some sleep."</p>

<p>She nodded. After a long while, her head drooped. She
jerked awake again. Cochrane ordered her vexedly to
make herself comfortable. She stretched out beside the
wall of wood that Cochrane had made. She said quietly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"While we're looking for food tomorrow morning, we'd
better keep our eyes open for a place to build a house."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Cochrane kept watch through the dark hours. He heard
night-cries in the forest, and once toward dawn the distant
volcano seemed to undergo a fresh paroxysm of activity.
Boomings and explosions rumbled in the night. There were
flickerings in the sky. But there were fewer temblors after
it, and no shocks at all.</p>

<p>More than once, Cochrane found himself dozing. It
was difficult to stay in a state of alarm. There was but one
single outcry in the forest that sounded like the shriek of
a creature seized by a carnivore. That was not nearby. He
tried to make plans. He felt bitterly self-reproachful that
he knew so few of the things that would be useful to a
castaway. But he had been a city man all his life. Woodcraft
was not only out of his experience&mdash;on overcrowded
Earth it would have been completely useless.</p>

<p>From time to time he found himself thinking, instead
of practical matters, of the astonishing sturdiness of spirit
Babs displayed.</p>

<p>When she waked, well after daybreak, and sat up blinking,
he said:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;Babs. We're in this together. From now on, if
you want to tell me something for my own good, go ahead!
Right?"</p>

<p>She rubbed her eyes on her knuckles and said,</p>

<p>"I'd have done that anyhow. For both our good. Don't
you think we'd better try to find a place where we can get
a drink of water? Water has to be right to drink!"</p>

<p>They set off, Cochrane carrying the weapon he'd
brought from the ship. It was Babs who pointed out that
a stream should almost certainly be found where rain
would descend, downhill. Babs, too, spotted one of the
small, foot-high furry bipeds feasting gluttonously on small
round objects that grew from the base of a small tree
instead of on its branches. The tree, evidently, depended
on four-footed rather than on flying creatures to scatter
its seeds. They gathered samples of the fruit. Cochrane
peeled a sliver of the meat from one of the round objects
and put it under his watchstrap.</p>

<p>They found a stream. They found other fruits, and
Cochrane prepared the same test for them as for the first.
One of the samples turned his skin red and angry almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
immediately. He discarded it and all the fruits of the kind
from which it came.</p>

<p>At midday they tasted the first-gathered fruit. The flesh
was red and juicy. There was a texture it was satisfying to
chew on. The taste was indeterminate save for a very
mild flavor of maple and peppermint mixed together.</p>

<p>They had no symptoms of distress afterward. Other
fruits were less satisfactory. Of the samples which the
skin-test said were non-poisonous, one was acrid and astringent,
and two others had no taste except that of greenness&mdash;practically
the taste of any leaf one might chew.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Cochrane <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'wrily'.">wryly</ins>, as they headed back
toward the ash-clearing at nightfall, "we've got to find out
if the animals can be eaten."</p>

<p>Babs nodded matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Tonight I'm taking part of the watch. As you
remarked this morning, we're in this together."</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply, and she flushed.</p>

<p>"I mean it!" she said doggedly. "I'm watching part of
the night!"</p>

<p>He was desperately tired. His muscles were not yet
back to normal after the low gravity on the moon. She'd
had more rest than he. He had to let her help. But there
was embarrassment between them because it looked as
if they would have to spend the rest of their lives together,
and they had not made the decision. It had been made for
them. And they had not acknowledged it yet.</p>

<p>When they reached the clearing, Cochrane began to
drag new logs toward the central place where much of last
night's supply of fuel remained. Matter-of-factly, Babs
began to haul stuff with him. He said vexedly:</p>

<p>"Quit it! I've already been realizing how little I know
about the things we're going to need to survive! Let me
fool myself about masculine strength, anyhow!"</p>

<p>She smiled at him, a very little. But she went obediently
to the fire to experiment with cookery of the one palatable
variety of fruit from this planet's trees. He drove himself
to bring more wood than before. When he settled down
she said absorbedly:</p>

<p>"Try this, Jed."</p>

<p>Then she flushed hotly because she'd inadvertently used
his familiar name. But she extended something that was
toasted and not too much burned. He ate, with weariness
sweeping over him like a wave. The cooked fruit was almost
a normal food, but it did need salt. There would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
trouble finding salt on this planet. The water that should
be in the seas was frozen in the glaciers. Salt would not
have been leached out of the soil and gathered in the seas.
It would be a serious problem. But Cochrane was very
tired indeed.</p>

<p>"I'll take the first two hours," said Babs briskly. "Then
I'll wake you."</p>

<p>He showed her how to use the weapon. He meant to
let himself drift quietly off to sleep, acting as if he had a
little trouble going off. But he didn't. He lay down, and
the next thing he knew Babs was shaking him violently.
In the first dazed instant when he opened his eyes he
thought they were surrounded by forest fire. But it wasn't
that. It was dawn, and Babs had let him sleep the whole
night through, and the sky was golden-yellow from one
horizon to the other. More, he heard the now-familiar cries
of creatures in the forest. But also he heard a roaring
sound, very thin and far away, which could only be one
thing.</p>

<p>"Jed! Jed! Get up! Quick! The ship's coming back!
The ship! We've got to move!"</p>

<p>She dragged him to his feet. He was suddenly wide-awake.
He ran with her. He flung back his head and stared
up as he ran. There was a pin-point of flame and vapor
almost directly overhead. It grew swiftly in size. It plunged
downward.</p>

<p>They reached the surrounding forest and plunged into
it. Babs stumbled, and Cochrane caught her, and they ran
onward hand in hand to get clear away from the down-blast
of the rockets. The rocket-roaring grew louder and
louder.</p>

<p>The castaways gazed. It was the ship. From below, fierce
flames poured down, blue-white and raging. The silver
hull slanted a little. It shifted its line of descent. It came
down with a peculiar deftness of handling that Cochrane
had not realized before. Its rockets splashed, but the flame
did not extend out to the edge of the clearing that had
been burned off at first. The rocket-flames, indeed, did
not approach the proportion to be seen on rockets on film-tape,
or as Cochrane had seen below the moon-rocket descending
on Earth.</p>

<p>The ship settled within yards of its original landing-place.
Its rockets dwindled, but remained burning. They
dwindled again. The noise was outrageous, but still not the
intolerable tumult of a moon-rocket landing on Earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The rockets cut off.</p>

<p>The airlock door opened. Cochrane and Babs waved
cheerfully from the edge of the clearing. Holden appeared
in the door and shouted down:</p>

<p>"Sorry to be so long coming back."</p>

<p>He waved and vanished. They had, of course, to wait
until the ground at least partly cooled before the landing-sling
could be used. Around them the noises of the forest
continued. There were cooling, crackling sounds from the
ship.</p>

<p>"I wonder how they found their way back!" said Babs.
"I didn't think they ever could. Did you?"</p>

<p>"Babs," said Cochrane, "you lied to me! You said you'd
wake me in two hours. But you let me sleep all night!"</p>

<p>"You'd let me sleep the night before," she told him composedly.
"I was fresher than you were, and today'd have
been a pretty bad one. We were going to try to kill some
animals. You needed the rest."</p>

<p>Cochrane said slowly:</p>

<p>"I found out something, Babs. Why you could face
things. Why we humans haven't all gone mad. I think I've
gotten the woman's viewpoint now, Babs. I like it."</p>

<p>She inspected the looming blister-ports of the ship, now
waiting for the ground to cool so they could come aboard.</p>

<p>"I think we'd have made out if the ship hadn't come,"
Cochrane told her. <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original single quote changed to double quote.">"We'd</ins> have had a woman's viewpoint
to work from. Yours. You looked ahead to building a
house. Of course you thought of finding food, but you were
thinking of the possibility of winter and&mdash;building a house.
You weren't thinking only of survival. You were thinking
far ahead. Women must think farther ahead than men do!"</p>

<p>Babs looked at him briefly, and then returned to her
apparently absorbed contemplation of the ship.</p>

<p>"That's what's the matter with people back on Earth,"
Cochrane said urgently. "There's no frustration as long as
women can look ahead&mdash;far ahead, past here and now!
When women can do that, they can keep men going. It's
when there's nothing to plan for that men can't go on because
women can't hope. You see? You saw a city here. A
little city, with separate homes. On Earth, too many people
can't think of more than living-quarters and keeping food
enough for them&mdash;them only!&mdash;coming in. They can't hope
for more. And it's when that happens&mdash;You see?"</p>

<p>Babs did not answer. Cochrane fumbled. He said
angrily:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Confound it, can't you see what I'm trying to say? We'd
have been better off, as castaways, than back on Earth
crowded and scared of our jobs! I'm saying I'd rather
stay here with you than go back to the way I was living before
we started off on this voyage! I think the two of us
could make out under any circumstances! I don't want
to try to make out without you! It isn't sense!" Then he
scowled helplessly. "Dammit, I've staged plenty of shows
in which a man asked a girl to marry him, and they were
all phoney. It's different, now that <i>I</i> mean it! What's a
good way to ask you to marry me?"</p>

<p>Babs looked momentarily up into his face. She smiled
ever so faintly.</p>

<p>"They're watching us from the ports," she said. "If you
want my viewpoint&mdash;If we were to wave to them that we'll
be right back, we can get some more of those fruits I
cooked. It might be interesting to have some to show them."</p>

<p>He scowled more deeply than before.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you feel that way. But if that's it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And on the way," said Babs. "When they're not watching,
you might kiss me."</p>

<p>They had a considerable pile of the red-fleshed fruits
ready when the ground had cooled enough for them to
reach the landing-sling.</p>

<p>Once aboard the ship, Cochrane headed for the control-room,
with Jamison and Bell tagging after him. Bell had
an argument.</p>

<p>"But the volcano's calmed down&mdash;there's only a wall
of steam where the lava hit the glaciers&mdash;and we could fix
up a story in a couple of hours! I've got <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphen removed to correspond with other usage in text.">background</ins> shots!
You and Babs could make the story-scenes and we'd have
a castaway story! Perfect! The first true castaway story
from the stars&mdash;. You know what that would mean!"</p>

<p>Cochrane snarled at him.</p>

<p>"Try it and I'll tear you limb from limb! I've put enough
of other people's private lives on the screen! My own
stays off! I'm not going to have even a phoney screen-show
built around Babs and me for people to gabble
about!"</p>

<p>Bell said in an injured tone:</p>

<p>"I'm only trying to do a good job! I started off on this
business as a writer. I haven't had a real chance to show
what I can do with this sort of material!"</p>

<p>"Forget it!" Cochrane snapped again. "Stick to your
cameras!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Jamison said hopefully:</p>

<p>"You'll give me some data on plants and animals, Mr.
Cochrane? Won't you? I'm doing a book with Bell's pictures,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me alone!" raged Cochrane.</p>

<p>He reached the control-room. Al, the pilot, sat at the
controls with an air of special alertness.</p>

<p>"You're all right? For our lined up trip, we ought to
leave in about twenty minutes. We'll be pointing just about
right then."</p>

<p>"I'm all right," said Cochrane. "And you can take off
when you please." To Jones he said: "How'd you find us?
I didn't think it could be done."</p>

<p>"Doctor Holden figured it out," said Jones. "Simple
enough, but I was lost! When the ground-shocks came,
everybody else ran to the ship. We waited for you. You
didn't come." It had been, of course, because Cochrane
would not risk taking Babs through a forest in which trees
were falling. "We finally had to choose between taking off
and crashing. So we took off."</p>

<p>"That was quite right. We'd all be messed up if you
hadn't," Cochrane told him.</p>

<p>Jones waved his hands.</p>

<p>"I didn't think we could ever find you again. We were
sixty light-years away when that booster effect died out.
Then Doctor Holden got on the communicator. He got
Earth. The astronomers back there located us and gave us
the line to get back by. We found the planet. Even then
I didn't see how we'd pick out the valley. But Doc had had
'em checking the shots we transmitted as we were making
our landing. We had the whole first approach on film-tape.
They put a crowd of map-comparators to work. We
went in a Space Platform orbit around the planet, transmitting
what we saw from out there&mdash;they figured the orbit for
us, too&mdash;and they checked what we transmitted against
what we'd photographed going down. So they were able
to spot the exact valley and tell us where to come down.
We actually spotted this valley last night, but we couldn't
land in the dark."</p>

<p>Cochrane felt abashed.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have done that job," he admitted, "so I
didn't think anybody could. Hm. Didn't all this cost a lot
of fuel?"</p>

<p>Jones actually smiled.</p>

<p>"I worked out something. We don't use as much fuel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
as we did. We're probably using too much now. Al&mdash;go
ahead and lift. I want to check what the new stuff does,
anyhow. Take off!"</p>

<p>The pilot threw a switch, and Jones threw another, a
newly installed one, just added to his improvised control-column.
A light glowed brightly. Al pressed one button,
very gently. A roaring set up outside. The ship started up.
There was practically no feeling of acceleration, this time.
The ship rose lightly. Even the rocket-roar was mild indeed,
compared to its take-off from Luna and the sound of its
first landing on the planet just below.</p>

<p>Cochrane saw the valley floors recede, and mountain-walls
drop below. From all directions, then, vegetation-filled
valleys flowed toward the ship, and underneath. Glaciers
appeared, and volcanic cones, and then enormous stretches
of white, with smoking dots here and there upon it. In
seconds, it seemed, the horizon was visibly curved. In
other seconds the planet being left behind was a monstrous
white ball, and there were patches of intolerable white
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphen removed to correspond with other usage in text.">sunlight</ins> coming in the ports.</p>

<p>And Cochrane felt queer. Jones had given the order for
take-off. Jones had determined to leave at this moment,
because Jones had tests he wanted to make.... Cochrane
felt like a passenger. From the man who decided things
because he was the one who knew what had to be done,
he had become something else. He had been absent
two nights and part of a day, and decisions had been made
in which he had no part&mdash;</p>

<p>It felt queer. It felt even startling.</p>

<p><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original single quote changed to a double quote mark.">"We're</ins> in a modification of the modified Dabney field
now," observed Jones in a gratified tone. "You know the
original theory."</p>

<p>"I don't," acknowledged Cochrane.</p>

<p>"The field's always a pipe, a tube, a column of stressed
space between the field-plates," Jones reminded him.
"When we landed the first time, back yonder, the tail of the
ship wasn't in the field at all. The field stretched from the
bow of the ship only, out to that last balloon we dropped.
We were letting down at an angle to that line. It was like
a kite and a string and the kite's tail. The string was the
Dabney field, and the directions we were heading was the
kite's tail."</p>

<p>Cochrane nodded. It occurred to him that Jones was
very much unlike Dabney. Jones had discovered the Dabney
field, but having sold the fame-rights to it, he now apparently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
thought "Dabney Field" was the proper technical
term for his own discovery, even in his own mind.</p>

<p>"Back on the moon," Jones went on zestfully, "I wasn't
sure that a field once established would hold in atmosphere.
I hoped that with enough power I could keep it, but I
wasn't sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This doesn't mean much to me, Jones," said Cochrane.
"What does it add up to?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;the field held down into atmosphere. And we
were out of the primary field as far as the tail of the ship
was concerned. But this time we landed, I'd hooked in
some ready-installed circuits. There was a second Dabney
field from the stern of the ship to the bow. There was the
main one, going out to those balloons and then back to
Earth. But there was&mdash;and is&mdash;a second one only enclosing
the ship. It's a sort of bubble. We can still trail a
field behind us, and anybody can follow in any sort of
ship that's put into it. But now the ship has a completely
independent, second field. Its tail is never outside!"</p>

<p>Cochrane did not have the sort of mind to find such
information either lucid or suggestive.</p>

<p>"So what happens?"</p>

<p>"We have both plates of a Dabney field always with us,"
said Jones triumphantly. "We're always in a field, even
landing in atmosphere, and the ship has practically no
mass even when it's letting down to landing. It has weight,
but next to no mass. Didn't you notice the difference?"</p>

<p>"Stupid as it may seem, I didn't," admitted Cochrane.
"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about."</p>

<p>Jones looked at him patiently.</p>

<p>"Now we can shoot our exhaust out of the field! The
ship-field, not the main one!"</p>

<p>"I'm still numb," said Cochrane. "Multiple sclerosis
of the brain-cells, I suppose. Let me just take your word
for it."</p>

<p>Jones tried once more.</p>

<p>"Try to see it! Listen! When we landed the first time
we had to use a lot of fuel because the tail of the ship
wasn't in the Dabney field. It had mass. So we had to use
a lot of rocket-power to slow down that mass. In the field,
the ship hasn't much mass&mdash;the amount depends on the
strength of the field&mdash;but rockets depend for their thrust
on the mass that's thrown away astern. Looked at that way,
rockets shouldn't push hard in a Dabney field. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
oughtn't to be any gain to be had by the field at all. You
see?"</p>

<p>Cochrane fumbled in his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I thought of that. But there is an advantage.
The ship does work."</p>

<p>"Because," said Jones, triumphant again, "the field-effect
depends partly on temperature! The gases in the
rocket-blast are hot, away up in the thousands of degrees.
They don't have normal inertia, but they do have what you
might call heat-inertia. They acquire a sort of fictitious
mass when they get hot enough. So we carry along fuel
that hasn't any inertia to speak of when it's cold, but acquires
a lunatic sort of substitute for inertia when it's
genuinely hot. So a ship can travel in a Dabney field!"</p>

<p>"I'm relieved," acknowledged Cochrane. "I thought you
were about to tell me that we couldn't lift off the moon,
and I was going to ask how we got here."</p>

<p>Jones smiled patiently.</p>

<p>"What I'm telling you now is that we can shoot rocket-blasts
out of the Dabney field we make with the stern of
the ship! Landing, we keep our fuel and the ship with next
to no mass, and we shoot it out to where it does have mass,
and the effect is practically the same as if we were pushing
against something solid! And so we started off with fuel
for maybe five or six landings and take-offs against Earth
gravity. But with this new trick, we've got fuel for a couple
of hundred!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Cochrane mildly. "This is the first thing
you've said that meant anything to me. Congratulations!
What comes next?"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be pleased," said Jones. "What I'm
really telling you is that now we've got fuel enough to reach
the Milky Way."</p>

<p>"Let's not," suggested Cochrane, "and say we did!
You've got a new star picked out to travel to?"</p>

<p>Jones shrugged his shoulders. In him, the gesture indicated
practically hysterical frustration. But he said:</p>

<p>"Yes. Twenty-one light-years. Back on Earth they're
anxious for us to check on sol-type suns and Earth-type
planets."</p>

<p>"For once," said Cochrane, "I am one with the great
scientific minds. Let's go over."</p>

<p>He made his way to the circular stairway leading down
to the main saloon. On his clumsy way across the saloon
floor to the communicator, he felt the peculiar sensation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the booster-current, which should have been a sound, but
wasn't. It was the sensation which had preceded the preposterous
leap of the space-ship away from Luna, when
in a heart-beat of time all stars looked like streaks of light,
and the ship traveled nearly two light-centuries.</p>

<p>Sunshine blinked, and then shone again in the ports
around the saloon walls. The second shining came from a
different direction&mdash;as if somebody had switched off one
exterior light and turned on another&mdash;and at a different
angle to the floor.</p>

<p>Cochrane reached the communicator. He felt no weight.
He strapped himself into the chair. He switched on the
vision-phone which sent radiation along the field to a balloon
two hundred odd light-years from Earth&mdash;that was
the balloon near the glacier planet&mdash;and then switched to
the field traveling to a second balloon then the last hundred
seventy-odd light-years back to the moon, and then
from Luna City down to Earth.</p>

<p>He put in his call. He got an emergency message that
had been waiting for him. Seconds later he fought his way
frantically through no-weight to the control-room again.</p>

<p>"Jamison! Bell!" he cried desperately. "We've got a
broadcast due in twenty minutes! I lost track of time!
We're sponsored on four continents and we damwell have
to put on a show! What the devil! Why didn't somebody&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jamison said obviously from a blister-port where he
swung a squat star-telescope from one object to another:</p>

<p>"Noo-o-o. That's a gas-giant. We'd be squashed if we
landed there&mdash;though that big moon looks promising. I
think we'd better try yonder."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Jones in a flat voice. "Center on the next
one in, Al, and we'll toddle over."</p>

<p>Cochrane felt the ship swinging in emptiness. He knew
because it seemed to turn while he felt that he stayed still.</p>

<p>"We've got a show to put on!" he raged. "We've got to
fake something&mdash;."</p>

<p>Jamison looked aside from his telescope.</p>

<p>"Tell him, Bell," he said expansively.</p>

<p>"I wrote a script of sorts," said Bell apologetically. "The
story-line's not so good&mdash;that's why I wanted a castaway
narrative to put in it, though I wouldn't have had time,
really. We spliced film and Jamison narrated it, and you
can run it off. It's a kind of show. We ran it as a space-platform
survey of the glacier-planet, basing it on pictures
we took while we were in orbit around it. It's a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
travelogue. Jamison did himself proud. Alicia can find the
tape-can for you."</p>

<p>He went back to his cameras. Cochrane saw a monstrous
globe swing past a control-room port. It was a featureless
mass of clouds, save for striations across what must be its
equator. It looked like the Lunar Observatory pictures of
Jupiter, back in the Sun's family of planets.</p>

<p>It went past the port, and a moon swam into view.
It was a very large moon. It had at least one ice-cap&mdash;and
therefore an atmosphere&mdash;and there were mottlings of its
surface which could hardly be anything but continents and
seas.</p>

<p>"We've got to put a show on!" raged Cochrane. "And
now!"</p>

<p>"It's all set," Bell assured him. "You can transmit it.
I hope you like it!"</p>

<p>Cochrane sputtered. But there was nothing to do but
transmit whatever Bell and Jamison had gotten ready. He
swam with nightmarelike difficulty back to the communicator.
He shouted frantically for Babs. She and Alicia came.
Alicia found the film-tape, and Cochrane threaded it into
the transmitter, and bitterly ran the first few feet. Babs
smiled at him, and Alicia looked at him oddly. Evidently,
Babs had confided the consequence of their casting-away.
But Cochrane faced an emergency. He began to check timings
with far-distant Earth.</p>

<p>When the ship approached a second planet, Cochrane
saw nothing of it. He was furiously monitoring the broadcast
of a show in which he'd had no hand at all. From his
own, professional standpoint it was terrible. Jamison
spouted interminably, so Cochrane considered. Al, the
pilot, was actually interviewed by an offscreen voice! But
the pictures from space were excellent. While the ship
floated in orbit, waiting to descend to pick up Babs and
Cochrane, Bell had hooked his camera to an amplifying
telescope and he did have magnificent shots of dramatic
terrain on the planet now twenty light-years behind.</p>

<p>Cochrane watched the show in a mingling of jealousy
and relief. It was not as good as he would have done. But
fortunately, Bell and Jamison had stuck fairly close to
straight travelogue-stuff, and close-up shots of vegetation
and animals had been interspersed with the remoter pictures
with moderate competence, if without undue imagination.
An audience which had not seen many shows of the
kind would be thrilled. It even amounted to a valid change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of pace. Anybody who watched this would at least want
to see more and different pictures from the stars.</p>

<p>Halfway through, he heard the now-muffled noise of
rockets. He knew the ship was descending through atmosphere
by the steady sound, though he had not the faintest
idea what was outside. He ground his teeth as&mdash;for timing&mdash;he
received the commercial inserted in the film. The
U. S. commercials served the purpose, of course. He could
not watch the other pictures shown to residents of other
than North America in the commercial portions of the
show.</p>

<p>He was counting seconds to resume transmission when
he felt the slight but distant impact which meant that the
ship had touched ground. A very short time after, even the
lessened, precautionary rocket-roar cut off.</p>

<p>Cochrane ground his teeth. The ship had landed on a
planet he had not seen and in whose choice he had had no
hand. He was humiliated. The other members of the ship's
company looked out at scenes no other human eyes had
ever beheld.</p>

<p>He regarded the final commercial, inserted into the
broadcast for its American sponsor. It showed, purportedly,
the true story of two girl friends, one blonde and one brunette,
who were wall-flowers at all parties. They tried
frantically to remedy the situation by the use of this toothpaste
and that, and this deodorant and the other. In vain!
But then they became the centers of all the festivities they
attended, as soon as they began to wash their hair with
Rayglo Shampoo.</p>

<p>Holden and Johnny Simms came clattering down from
the control-room together. They looked excited. They
plunged together toward the stair-well that would take them
to the deck on which the airlock opened.</p>

<p>Holden panted,</p>

<p>"Jed! Creatures outside! They look like men!"</p>

<p>The communicator-screen faithfully monitored the end
of the commercial. Two charming girls, radiant and lovely,
raised their voices in grateful song, hymning the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'virtures'.">virtues</ins> of
Rayglo Shampoo. There followed brisk reminders of the
superlative, magical results obtained by those who used
Rayglo Foundation Cream, Rayglo Kisspruf Lipstick, and
Rayglo home permanent&mdash;in four strengths; for <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original lacked the comma after 'normal'.">normal,</ins>
hard-to-wave, easy-to-wave, and children's hair.</p>

<p>Cochrane heard the clanking of the airlock door.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_NINE" id="CHAPTER_NINE"></a>CHAPTER NINE</h2>


<p>He made for the control-room, where the ports
offered the highest and widest and best views of everything
outside. When he arrived, Babs and Alicia stood together,
staring out and down. Bell frantically worked a camera.
Jamison gaped at the outer world. Al the pilot made frustrated
gestures, not quite daring to leave his controls while
there was even an outside chance the ship's landing-fins
might find flaws in their support. Jones adjusted something
on the new set of controls he had established for the extra
Dabney field. Jones was not wholly normal in some ways.
He was absorbed in technical matters even more fully
than Cochrane in his own commercial enterprises.</p>

<p>Cochrane pushed to a port to see.</p>

<p>The ship had landed in a small glade. There were trees
nearby. The trees had extremely long, lanceolate leaves,
roughly the shape of grass-blades stretched out even longer.
In the gentle breeze that blew outside, they waved extravagantly.
There were hills in the distance, and nearby out-croppings
of gray rocks. This sky was blue like the sky of
Earth. It was, of course, inevitable that any colorless atmosphere
with dust-particles suspended in it would establish a
blue sky.</p>

<p>Holden was visible below, moving toward a patch of
reed-like vegetation rising some seven or eight feet from
the rolling soil. He had hopped quickly over the scorched
area immediately outside the ship. It was much smaller
than that made by the first landing on the other planet, but
even so he had probably damaged his footwear to excess.
But he now stood a hundred yards from the ship. He made
gestures. He seemed to be talking, as if trying to persuade
some living creature to show itself.</p>

<p>"We saw them peeping," said Babs breathlessly, coming
beside Cochrane. "Once one of them ran from one patch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of reeds to another. It looked like a man. There are at
least three of them in there&mdash;whatever they are!"</p>

<p>"They can't be men," said Cochrane grimly. "They
can't!" Johnny Simms was not in sight. "Where's Simms?"</p>

<p>"He has a gun," said Babs. "He was going to get one,
anyhow, so he could protect Doctor Holden."</p>

<p>Cochrane glanced straight down. The airlock door was
open, and the end of a weapon peered out. Johnny Simms
might be in a better position there to protect Holden by
gun-fire, but he was assuredly safer, himself. There was no
movement anywhere. Holden did not move closer to the
reeds. He still seemed to be speaking soothingly to the unseen
creatures.</p>

<p>"Why can't there be men here?" asked Babs. "I don't
mean actually men, but&mdash;manlike creatures? Why couldn't
there be rational creatures like us? I know you said so
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cochrane shook his head. He believed implicitly that
there could not be men on this planet. On the glacier planet
every animal had been separately devised from the creatures
of Earth. There were resemblances, explicable as the
result of parallel evolution. By analogy, there could not be
exactly identical mankind on another world because evolution
there would be parallel but not the same. But if there
were even a mental equal to men, no matter how unhuman
such a creature might appear, if there were a really rational
animal anywhere in the cosmos off of Earth, the result
would be catastrophic.</p>

<p>"We humans," Cochrane told her, "live by our conceit.
We demand more than animality of ourselves because we
believe we are more than animals&mdash;and we believe we are
the only creatures that are! If we came to believe we were
not unique, but were simply a cleverer animal, we'd be
finished. Every nation has always started to destroy itself
every time such an idea spread."</p>

<p>"But we aren't only clever animals!" protested Babs.
"We <i>are</i> unique!"</p>

<p>Cochrane glanced at her out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>"Quite true."</p>

<p>Holden still stood patiently before the patch of reeds,
still seemed to talk, still with his hands outstretched in
what men consider the universal sign of peace.</p>

<p>There was a sudden movement at the back of the reed-patch,
quite fifty yards from Holden. A thing which did
look like a man fled madly for the nearest edge of woodland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
It was the size of a man. It had the pinkish-tan color
of naked human flesh. It ran with its head down, and it
could not be seen too clearly, but it was startlingly manlike
in outline. Up in the control-room Bell fairly yipped with
excitement and swung his camera. Holden remained oblivious.
He still tried to lure something out of concealment.
A second creature raced for the woods.</p>

<p>Tiny gray threads appeared in the air between the airlock
and the racing thing. Smoke. Johnny Simms was shooting
zestfully at the unidentified animal. He was using that
tracer ammunition which poor shots and worse sportsmen
adopt to make up for bad marksmanship.</p>

<p>The threads of smoke seemed to form a net about the
running things. They dodged and zig-zagged frantically.
Both of them reached safety.</p>

<p>A third tried it. And now Johnny Simms turned on
automatic fire. Bullets spurted from his weapon, trailing
threads of smoke so that the trails looked like a stream
from a hose. The stream swept through the space occupied
by the fugitive. It leaped convulsively and crashed to earth.
It kicked blindly.</p>

<p>Cochrane swore. Between the instant of the beginning
of the creature's flight and this instant, less than two seconds
had passed.</p>

<p>The threads which were smoke-trails drifted away. Then
a new thread streaked out. Johnny Simms fired once more
at his still-writhing victim. It kicked violently and was still.</p>

<p>Holden turned angrily. There seemed to be shoutings
between him and Johnny Simms. Then Holden trudged
around the reed-patch. There was no longer any sign of
life in the still shape on the ground. But it was normal
precaution not to walk into a jungle-like thicket in which
unknown, large living things had recently been sighted.
Johnny Simms fired again and again from his post in the
airlock. The smoke which traced his bullets ranged to the
woodland. He shot at imagined targets there. He fired at
his previous victim simply because it was something to
shoot at. He shot recklessly, foolishly.</p>

<p>Alicia, his wife, touched Jamison on the arm and spoke
to him urgently. Jamison followed her reluctantly down
the stairs. She would be going to the airlock. Johnny Simms,
shooting at the landscape, might shoot Holden. A thread of
bullet-smoke passed within feet of Holden's body. He
turned and shouted back at the ship.</p>

<p>The inner airlock door clanked open. There was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
sound of a shot, and the dead thing was hit again. The
bullet had been fired dangerously close to Holden. There
were voices below. Johnny Simms bellowed enragedly.</p>

<p>Alicia cried out.</p>

<p>There was silence below, but Cochrane was already
plunging toward the stairs. Babs followed closely.</p>

<p>When they rushed down onto the dining-room deck
they found Alicia deathly white, but with a flaming red
mark on her cheek. They found Johnny Simms roaring
with rage, waving the weapon he'd been shooting. Jamison
was uneasily in the act of trying to placate him.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;!" bellowed Johnny Simms. "I came on this
ship to hunt! I'm going to hunt! Try and stop me!"</p>

<p>He waved his weapon.</p>

<p>"I paid my money!" he shouted. "I won't take orders
from anybody! Nobody can boss me!"</p>

<p>Cochrane said icily:</p>

<p>"I can! Stop being a fool! Put down that gun! You
nearly shot Holden! You might still kill somebody. Put
it down!"</p>

<p>He walked grimly toward Johnny Simms. Johnny was
near the open airlock door. The outer door was open, too.
He could not retreat. He edged sidewise. Cochrane changed
the direction of his advance. There are people like Johnny
Simms everywhere. As a rule they are not classed as unable
to tell right from wrong unless they are rich enough
to hire a psychiatrist. Yet a variable but always-present
percentage of the human race ignores rules of conduct at
all times. They are the handicap, the burden, the main hindrance
to the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'maintainance'.">maintenance</ins> or the progress of civilization.
They are not consciously evil. They simply do not bother
to act otherwise than as rational animals. The rest of humanity
has to defend itself with police, with laws, and
sometimes with revolts, though those like Johnny Simms
have no motive beyond the indulgence of immediate inclinations.
But for that indulgence Johnny would risk any
injury to anybody else.</p>

<p>He edged further aside. Cochrane was white with disgusted
fury. Johnny Simms went into panic. He raised
his weapon, aiming at Cochrane.</p>

<p>"Keep back!" he cried ferociously. "I don't care if I
kill you!"</p>

<p>And he did not. It was the stark senselessness which
makes juvenile delinquents and Hitlers, and causes thugs
and hoodlums and snide lawyers and tricky business men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
It was the pure perversity which makes sane men frustrate.
It was an example of that infinite stupidity which is crime,
but is also only stupidity.</p>

<p>Cochrane saw Babs pulling competently at one of the
chairs at one of the tables nearby. He stopped, and Johnny
Simms took courage. Cochrane said icily:</p>

<p>"Just what the hell do you think we're here for, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Johnny Simms' eyes were wide and blank, like the eyes
of a small boy in a frenzy of destruction, when he has forgotten
what he started out to do and has become obsessed
with what damage he is doing.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be pushed around!" cried Johnny
Simms, more ferociously still. "From now on I'm going to
tell you what to do&mdash;"</p>

<p>Babs swung the chair she had slid from its fastenings.
It came down with a satisfying "<i>thunk</i>" on Johnny Simms'
head. His gun went off. The bullet missed Cochrane by
fractions of an inch. He plunged ahead.</p>

<p>Some indefinite time later, Babs was pulling desperately
at him. He had Johnny Simms on the floor and was throttling
him. Johnny Simms strangled and tore at his fingers.</p>

<p>Sanity came back to Cochrane with the effect of something
snapping. He got up. He nodded to Babs and she
picked up the gun Johnny Simms had used.</p>

<p>"I think," said Cochrane, breathing hard, "that you're
a good sample of everything I dislike. The worst thing you
do is make me act like you! If you touch a gun again on
this ship, I'll probably kill you. If you get arrogant again, I
will beat the living daylights out of you! Get up!"</p>

<p>Johnny Simms got up. He looked thoroughly scared.
Then, amazingly, he beamed at Cochrane. He said amiably:</p>

<p>"I forgot. I'm that way. Alicia'll tell you. I don't blame
you for getting mad. I'm sorry. But I'm that way!"</p>

<p>He brushed himself off, beaming at Alicia and Jamison
and Babs and Cochrane. Cochrane ground his teeth. He
went to the airlock and looked down outside.</p>

<p>Holden was bent over the creature Johnny Simms had
killed. He straightened up and came back toward the ship.
He went faster when the ground grew hot under his feet.
He fairly leaped into the landing-sling and started it up.</p>

<p>"Not human," he reported to Cochrane when he slipped
from the sling in the airlock. "There's no question about it
when you are close. It's more nearly a bird than anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
else. It was warm-blooded. It has a beak. There are penguins
on Earth that have been mistaken for men.</p>

<p>"I did a show once," said Cochrane coldly, "that had
clips of old films of cockfighting in it. There was a kind of
gamecock called Cornish Game that was fairly manshaped.
If it had been big enough&mdash;Pull in the sling and close the
lock. We're moving."</p>

<p>He turned away. Babs stood by Alicia, offering a handkerchief
for Alicia to put to her cheek. Jamison listened
unhappily as Johnny Simms explained brightly that he had
always been that way. When he got excited he didn't realize
what he was doing. He said almost with pride that he hadn't
ever been any other way than that. He didn't really mean
to kill anybody, but when he got excited&mdash;.</p>

<p>"What happened?" demanded Holden.</p>

<p>"Our little psychopath," said Cochrane in a grating
voice, "put on an act. He threatened me with a rifle. He
hit Alicia first. Jamison, trace that bullet-hole. See if it got
through to the skin of the ship."</p>

<p>He started for the stairs again. Then he was startled
by the frozen immobility of Holden. Holden's face was
deadly. His hands were clenched. Johnny Simms said with
a fine boyish frankness:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Cochrane! No hard feelings?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Cochrane snapped. "Hard feelings! I've got
them!"</p>

<p>He took Holden's arm. He steered him up the steps.
Holden resisted for the fraction of a second, and Cochrane
gripped his arm tighter. He got him up to the deck above.</p>

<p>"If I'd been here," said Holden, unsteadily, "I'd have
killed him&mdash;if he hit Alicia! Psychopath or no psychopath&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Cochrane firmly. "He shot at me! And
in my small way I'm a psychopath too, Bill. My psychosis
is that I don't like his kind of psychosis. I am psychotically
devoted to sense and my possibly quaint idea of decency.
I am abnormally concerned with the real world&mdash;and you'd
better come back to it! Look here! I'm pathologically in
revolt against such imbecilities as an overcrowded Earth
and people being afraid of their jobs and people going
crackpot from despair. You don't want me to get cured of
that, do you? Then get hold of yourself!"</p>

<p>Bill Holden swallowed. He was still white. But he managed
to grimace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're right. Lucky I was outside. You're not a bad
psychologist yourself, Jed."</p>

<p>"I'm better," said Cochrane cynically, "at putting on
shows with scrap film-tape and dream-stuff. So I'm going
to look at the films Bell took as we landed on this planet,
and work out some ideas for broadcasts."</p>

<p>He went up another flight, and Holden went with him
in a sort of stilly, unnatural calm. Cochrane ran the film-tape
through the reversed camera for examination.</p>

<p>Outside, there waved long green tresses of extraordinarily
elongated leaves. The patches of reed-like stuff stirred
in the breeze. Jamison appeared in the control-room. He
began to question Holden hopefully about the ground-cover
outside. It was not grass. It was broad-leaved. There would
be, Jamison decided happily, an infinitude of under-leaf
forms of life. They would most likely be insects, and there
would be carnivorous other insects to prey upon them.
Some species would find it advantageous to be burrowing
insects. There must be other kinds of birds than the giant
specimens that looked like men at a distance, too. On the
glacier planet there had been few birds but many furry
creatures. Possibly the situation was reversed here, though
of course it need not be ...</p>

<p>"Hm," said Cochrane when the films were all run
through. "Ice-caps and land and seas. Plenty of green
vegetation, so presumably the air is normal for humans.
Since you're alive, Holden, we can assume it isn't instantly
fatal, can't we? The gravity's tolerable&mdash;a little on the light
side, maybe, compared to the glacier planet."</p>

<p>He was silent, staring at the blank wall of the control-room.
He frowned. Suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"Does anybody back on Earth know that Babs and I
were castaways?"</p>

<p>"No," said Holden, still very quiet indeed. "Alicia ran
the control-board. She told everybody you were too busy
to be called to the communicator. It was queer with you
away! Jamison and Bell tied themselves in chairs and
spliced tape. Johnny, of course"&mdash;his voice was very carefully
toneless&mdash;"wouldn't do anything useful. I was space-sick
a lot of the time. But I did help Alicia figure out what
to say on the communicator. There must be hundreds of
calls backed up for you to take."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Cochrane. "I'll go take some of them.
Jones, could we make a flit to somewhere else on this
planet?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Jones said negligently,</p>

<p>"I told you we've got fuel to reach the Milky Way.
Where do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere," said Cochrane. "The scenery isn't dramatic
enough here for a new broadcast. We've got to have some
lurid stuff for our next show. Things are shaping up except
for the need of just the right scenery to send back to
Earth."</p>

<p>"What kind of scenery do you want?"</p>

<p>"Animals preferred," said Cochrane. "Dinosaurs would
do. Or buffalo or a reasonable facsimile. What I'd actually
like more than anything else would really be a herd of
buffalo."</p>

<p>Jamison gasped.</p>

<p>"Buffalo?"</p>

<p>"Meat," said Cochrane in an explanatory tone. "On the
hoof. The public-relations job all this has turned into, demands
a careful stimulation of all the basic urges. So I
want people to think of steaks and chops and roasts. If I
could get herds of animals from one horizon to another&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Meat-herds coming up," said Jones negligently. "I'll
call you."</p>

<p>Cochrane did not believe him. He went down to the
communicator again. He prepared to take the calls from
Earth that had been backed up behind the emergency demand
for an immediate broadcast-show that he'd met while
the ship came to its landing. There was an enormous
amount of business piled up. And it was slow work handling
it. His voice took six seconds to pass through something
over two hundred light-years of space in the Dabney
field, and then two seconds in normal space from the relay
in Lunar City. It was twelve seconds between the time he
finished saying something before the first word of the reply
reached him. It was very slow communication. He reflected
annoyedly that he'd have to ask Jones to make a special
Dabney field communication field as strong as was necessary
to take care of the situation.</p>

<p>The rockets growled and roared outside. The ship lifted.
Johnny Simms came storming up from below.</p>

<p>"My trophy!" he cried indignantly. "I want my trophy!"</p>

<p>Cochrane looked up impatiently from the screen.</p>

<p>"What trophy?"</p>

<p>"The thing I shot!" cried Johnny Simms fiercely. "I
want to have it mounted! Nobody else ever killed anything
like that! I want it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>The ship surged upward more strongly. Cochrane said
coldly:</p>

<p>"It's too late now. Get out. I'm busy."</p>

<p>He returned his eyes to the screen. Johnny Simms raced
for the stairs. A little later Cochrane heard shoutings in
the control-room. But he was too busy to inquire.</p>

<p>The ship drifted&mdash;with all the queasy sensation of no-weight&mdash;and
lifted again, and then there was a fairly long
period of weightlessness. At such times Holden would be
greenish and sick and tormented by space-sickness. Which
might be good for him at this particular time. For a long
time, it seemed, there were alternating periods of lift and
free fall, which in themselves were disturbing. Once the
free fall lasted until Cochrane began to feel uneasy. But
then the rockets roared once more and boomed loudly as if
the ship were leaving the planet altogether.</p>

<p>But Cochrane was talking business. In part he bluffed.
In part, quite automatically, he demanded much more than
he expected to get, simply because it is the custom in business
not to be frank about anything. Whatever he asked,
the other man would offer less. So he asked too much, and
the other man offered too little, each knowing in advance
very nearly on what terms they would finally settle. Considering
the cost of beam-phone time to Lunar City, not
to mention the extension to the stars, it was absurd, but it
was the way business is done.</p>

<p>Presently Cochrane called Babs and Alicia and had them
witness a tentative agreement, which had to be ratified by a
board of directors of a corporation back on Earth. That
board would jump at it, but the stipulation for possible cancellation
had to be made. It was mumbo-jumbo. Cochrane
felt satisfyingly competent at handling it.</p>

<p>While the formalities were in progress, the ship surged
and fell and swayed and surged again. Cochrane said ruefully:</p>

<p>"I hate to ask you to work under conditions like this,
Babs."</p>

<p>Babs grinned. He flushed a little.</p>

<p>"I know! When you were working for me I wasn't
considerate."</p>

<p>"Who am I working for now?"</p>

<p>"Us," said Cochrane. Then he looked guiltily at Alicia.
He felt embarrassment at having said anything in the least
sentimental before her. Considering Johnny Simms, it was
not too tactful. Her cheek, where it had been red, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
showed a distinct bruise. He said: "Sorry, Alicia&mdash;about
Johnny."</p>

<p>"I got into it myself," said Alicia. "I loved him. He
isn't really bad. If you want to know, I think he simply
decided years ago that he wouldn't grow up past the age of
six. He was a rich man's spoiled little boy. It was fun. So
he made a career of it. His family let him. I"&mdash;she smiled
faintly, "I'm making a career of taking care of him."</p>

<p>"Something can be done even with a six-year-old,"
growled Cochrane. "Holden&mdash;. But he wouldn't be the best
one to try."</p>

<p>"He definitely wouldn't be the best one to try," said
Alicia very quietly.</p>

<p>Cochrane turned away. She knew how Bill Holden felt.
Which might or might not be comforting to him.</p>

<p>The communicator again. The pictures of foot-high
furry bipeds on the glacier planet had made a sensation on
television. A toy-manufacturer wanted the right to make
toys like them. The pictures were copyrighted. Cochrane
matter-of-factly made the deal. There would be miniature
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphenated to correspond with other usage in text.">extra-terrestrial</ins> animals on sale in all toy-shops within
days. Spaceways, Inc., would collect a royalty on each toy
sold.</p>

<p>The rockets boomed, and lessened their noise, and
wavered up and down again. Then there was that deliberate,
crunching feel of the great landing-fins pressing into soil
with all the ship's weight bearing down. The rockets ran
on, drumming ever-so-faintly, for a little longer. Then they
cut off.</p>

<p>"We're landed again! Let's see where we are!"</p>

<p>They went up to the control-room. Johnny Simms stood
against the wall, sulking. He had managed his life very
successfully by acting like a spoiled little boy. Now he had
lost any idea of saner conduct. At the moment, he looked
ridiculous. But Alicia had a bruised cheek and Cochrane
could have been killed, and Holden had been in danger
because Johnny Simms wanted to and insisted on acting
like a rich man's spoiled little boy.</p>

<p>It occurred to Cochrane that Alicia would probably find
recompense for her humiliation and pain in the little-boy
penitence&mdash;exactly as temporary as any other little-boy
emotion&mdash;when she and Johnny Simms were alone together.</p>

<p>The ship had come down close to the sunset-line of the
planet. Away to the west there was the glint of blue sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Dusk was already descending here. There were smoothly
contoured hills in view, and there was a dark patch of forest
on one hilltop, and the trees at the woodland's edge had
the same drooping, grass-blade-like foliage of the trees first
seen. But there were larger and more solid giants among
them. The ship had landed on a small plateau, and downhill
from it a spring gushed out with such force that the
water-surface was rounded by pressure from below. The
water overflowed and went down toward the sea.</p>

<p>"I think we're all right," said Al, the pilot. But he
stayed in his seat, in case the ship threatened to sway over.
Cochrane inspected the outer world.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We sighted what I think you want," said Jones. He
looked dead-pan and yet secretly complacent. "Just watch."</p>

<p>The dusk grew deeper. Colorings appeared in the west.
They were very similar to the sunset-colorings on Earth.</p>

<p>"Not many volcanoes here."</p>

<p>The amount of dust was limited, as on Earth. A great
star winked into view in the east. It was as bright as Venus
seen from Earth. It had a just-perceptible disk. Close to it,
infinitely small, there was a speck of light which seemed
somehow like a star. Cochrane squinted at it. He thought
of the great gas-giant world he'd seen out a port on the
way here. It had an attendant moon-world which itself had
icecaps and seas and continents. He called Jamison.</p>

<p>"I think that's the planet," agreed Jamison. "We passed
close by it. We saw it."</p>

<p>"It had a moon," observed Cochrane. "A big one. It
looked like a world itself. What would it be like there?"</p>

<p>"Cooler than this," said Jamison promptly, "because it's
farther from the sun. But it might pick up some heat from
reflection from its primary's white clouds. It would be a fair
world. It has oceans and continents and strings of foam-girt
islands. But its sea is strange and dark and restless.
Gigantic tides surge in its depths, drawn by the planetary
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'collossus'.">colossus</ins> about which it swings. Its animal life&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Cut," said Cochrane dryly. "What do you really think?
Could it be another inhabitable world for people to move
to?"</p>

<p>Jamison looked annoyed at having been cut off.</p>

<p>"Probably," he said more prosaically. "The tides would
be monstrous, though."</p>

<p>"Might be used for power," said Cochrane. "We'll
see ..."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Jones spoke with elaborate casualness:</p>

<p>"Here's something to look at. On the ground."</p>

<p>Cochrane moved to see. The dusk had deepened still
more. The smooth, green-covered ground had become a
dark olive. Where bare hillsides gave upon the sky, there
were dark masses flowing slowly forward. The edges of the
hills turned black, and the blackness moved down their
nearer slopes. It was not an even front of darkness. There
were patches which preceded the others. They did not stay
distinct. They merged with the masses which followed them,
and other patches separated in their places. All of the darkness
moved without haste, with a sort of inexorable deliberation.
It moved toward the ship and the valley and the
gushing fountain and the stream which flowed from it.</p>

<p>"What on Earth&mdash;" began Cochrane.</p>

<p>"You're not on Earth," said Jones chidingly. "Al and I
found 'em. You asked for buffalo or a reasonable <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'facsimilie'.">facsimile</ins>.
I won't guarantee anything; but we spotted what looked
like herds of beasts moving over the green plains inland.
We checked, and they seemed to be moving in this direction.
Once we dropped down low and Bell got some pictures.
When he enlarged them, we decided they'd do. So
we lined up where they were all headed for, and here we
are. And here they are!"</p>

<p>Cochrane stared with all his eyes. Behind him, he heard
Bell fuming to himself as he tried to adjust a camera for
close-up pictures in the little remaining light. Babs stood
beside Cochrane, staring incredulously.</p>

<p>The darkness was beasts. They blackened the hillsides
on three sides of the ship. They came deliberately, leisurely
onward. They were literally uncountable. They were as
numerous as the buffalo that formerly thronged the western
plains of America. In black, shaggy masses, they came
toward the spring and its stream. Nearby, their heads could
be distinguished. And all of this was perfectly natural.</p>

<p>The cosmos is one thing. Where life exists, its living
creatures will fit themselves cunningly into each niche
where life can be maintained. On vast green plains there
will be animals to graze&mdash;and there will be animals to
prey on them. So the grazing things will band together in
herds for self-defense and reproduction. And where the
ground is covered with broad-leaved plants, such plants
will shelter innumerable tiny creatures, and some of them
will be burrowers. So rain will drain quickly into those burrowings
and not make streams. And therefore the drainage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
will reappear as springs, and the grazing animals will go
to those springs to drink. Often, they will gather more
densely at nightfall for greater protection from their enemies.
They will even often gather at the springs or their overflowing
brooks. This will happen anywhere that plains and
animals exist, on any planet to the edge of the galaxy, because
there are laws for living things as well as stones.</p>

<p>Great dark masses of the beasts moved unhurriedly past
the ship. They were roughly the size of cattle&mdash;which itself
would be determined by the gravity of the planet, setting a
maximum favorable size for grazing beasts with an ample
food-supply. There were thousands and tens of thousands
of them visible in the deepening night. They crowded to the
gushing spring and to the stream that flowed from it. They
drank. Sometimes groups of them waited patiently until
the way to the water was clear.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Jones.</p>

<p>"I think you filled my order," admitted Cochrane.</p>

<p>The night became starlight only, and Cochrane impatiently
demanded of Al or somebody that they measure
the length of a complete day and night on this planet. The
stars would move overhead at such-and-such a rate. So
many degrees in so much time. He needed, said Cochrane&mdash;as
if this order also could be filled&mdash;a day-length not
more than six hours shorter or longer than an Earth-day.</p>

<p>Jones and Al conferred and prepared to take some sort
of reading without any suitable instrument. Cochrane
moved restlessly about. He did not notice Johnny Simms.
Johnny had stood sullenly in his place, not moving to look
out the windows, ostentatiously ignoring everything and
everybody. And nobody paid attention! It was not a matter
to offend an adult, but it was very shocking indeed to a
rich man's son who had been able to make a career of staying
emotionally at a six-year-old level.</p>

<p>Cochrane's thoughts were almost feverish. If the day-length
here was suitable, all his planning was successful.
If it was too long or too short, he had grimly to look further&mdash;and
Spaceways, Inc., would still not be as completely
a success as he wanted. It would have been much
simpler to have measured the apparent size of the local
sun by any means available, and then simply to have timed
the intervals between its touching of the horizon and its
complete setting. But Cochrane hadn't thought of it at
sunset.</p>

<p>Presently he wandered down to where Babs and Alicia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
worked in the kitchen to prepare a meal. He tried to help.
The atmosphere was much more like that in a small apartment
back home than on a space-ship among the stars.
This was not in any way such a journey of exploration as
the writers of fiction had imagined. Jamison came down
presently and offered to prepare some special dish in which
he claimed to excel. There was no mention of Johnny
Simms. Alicia, elaborately ignoring all that was past, told
Jamison that Babs and Cochrane were now an acknowledged
romance and actually had plans for marriage immediately
the ship returned to Earth. Jamison made the
usual inept jests suited to such an occasion.</p>

<p>Presently they called the others to dinner. Jones and
Johnny Simms were long behind the others, and Jones' expression
was conspicuously dead-pan. Johnny Simms
looked sulkily rebellious. His sulking had not attracted
attention in the control-room. He had meant to refuse
sulkily to come to dinner. But Jones wouldn't trust him&mdash;alone
in the control-room. Now he sat down, scowling,
and ostentatiously refused to eat, despite Alicia's coaxing.
He snarled at her.</p>

<p>This, also, was not in the tradition of the behavior of
voyagers of space. They dined in the over-large saloon of
a ship that had never been meant really to leave the moon.
The ship stood upright under strange stars upon a stranger
world, and all about it outside there were the resting forms
of thousands upon thousands of creatures like cattle. And
the dinner-table conversation was partly family-style jests
about Babs' and Cochrane's new romantic status, and partly
about a television broadcast which had to be ready for a
certain number of Earth-hours yet ahead. And nobody
paid any attention to Johnny Simms, glowering at the table
and refusing to eat.</p>

<p>It was a mistake, probably.</p>

<p>Much, much later, Cochrane and Babs were again in
the control-room, and this time they were alone.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Cochrane vexedly. "Do you realize that I
haven't kissed you since we got back on the ship? What
happened?"</p>

<p>"You!" said Babs indignantly. "You've been thinking
about something else every second of the time!"</p>

<p>Cochrane did not think about anything else for several
minutes. He began to recall with new tolerance the insane
antics of people he had been producing shows about. They
had reason&mdash;those imaginary people&mdash;to act unreasonably.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>But presently his mind was working again.</p>

<p>"We've got to make some plans for ourselves," he said.
"We can live back on Earth, of course. We've already made
a neat sum out of the broadcasts from this trip. But I don't
think we'll want to live the way one has to live on Earth,
with too many people there. I'd like&mdash;."</p>

<p>Somebody came clattering up the stairs from below.</p>

<p>"Johnny?" It was Bell. "Is he up here?"</p>

<p>Cochrane released Babs.</p>

<p>"No. He's not here. Why?"</p>

<p>"He's missing," said Bell apprehensively. "Alicia says
he took a gun. A gun's gone, anyhow. He's vanished!"</p>

<p>Cochrane swore under his breath. A fool asserting his
dignity with a gun could be a serious matter indeed. He
switched on the control-room lights. He was not there.
They went down and hunted over the main saloon. He was
not there. Then Holden called harshly from the next deck
down.</p>

<p>There was Alicia by the inner airlock door. Her face was
deathly pale. She had opened the door. The outer door
was open too&mdash;and it had not been opened since this last
landing by anybody else. The landing-sling cables were run
out. They swung slowly in the light that fell upon them
from the inside of the ship.</p>

<p>A smell came in the opening. It was the smell of beasts.
It was a musky, ammoniacal smell, somehow not alien even
though it was unfamiliar. There were noises outside in the
night. Grunting sounds. Snortings. There were such sounds
as a vast concourse of grazing creatures would make in
the night-time, when gathered by thousands and myriads
for safety and for rest.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;went out," said Alicia desperately. "He meant to
punish us. He's a spoiled little boy. We weren't nice to him.
And&mdash;he was afraid of us too! So he ran away to make
us sorry!"</p>

<p>Cochrane went to look out of the lock and to call
Johnny Simms back. He gazed into absolute blackness on
the ground. He felt a queasy giddiness because there was
no hand-railing at the outer lock door and he knew the
depth of the fall outside. He raged, within himself. Johnny
Simms would feel triumphant when he was called. He
would require to be pleaded with to return. He would
pompously set terms for returning before he was killed....</p>

<p>Cochrane saw a flash of fire and the short streak of a
tracer-bullet's patch before it hit something. He heard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
report of the gun. He heard a bellow of agony and then a
scream of purest terror from Johnny Simms.</p>

<p>Then, from the ground, arose a truly monstrous tumult.
Every one of the creatures below raised its voice in a horrible,
bleating cry. The volume of sound was numbing&mdash;was
agonizing in sheer impact. There were stirrings and
clickings as of horns clashing against each other.</p>

<p>Another scream from Johnny Simms. He had moved.
It appeared that he was running. Cochrane saw more gun-flashes,
there were more shots. He clenched his hands and
waited for the thunderous vibration that would be all this
multitude of animals pounding through the night in blind
stampede.</p>

<p>It did not come. There was only that bleating, horrible
outcry as all the beasts bellowed of alarm and created this
noise to frighten their assailants away.</p>

<p>Twice more there were shots in the night. Johnny
Simms fired crazily and screamed in hysterical panic. Each
time the shots and screaming were farther away.</p>

<p>There were no portable lights with which to make a
search. It was unthinkable to go blundering among the
beasts in darkness.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do. Cochrane could only watch
and listen helplessly while the strong beast-smell rose to his
nostrils, and the innumerable noises of unseen uneasy creatures
sounded in his ears.</p>

<p>Inside the ship Alicia wept hopelessly. Babs tried in vain
to comfort her.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TEN" id="CHAPTER_TEN"></a>CHAPTER TEN</h2>


<p>The sun rose. Cochrane noted the time, it was
fourteen hours since sunset. The local day would be something
more than an Earth-day in length. The manner of
sunrise was familiar. There was a pale gray light in the
sky. It strengthened. Then reddish colors appeared, and
changed to gold, and the unnamed stars winked out one
after another. Presently the nearer hillsides ceased to be
black. There was light <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original read 'eveywhere'.">everywhere</ins>.</p>

<p>Alicia, white and haggard, waited to see what the light
would show.</p>

<p>But there was heavy mist everywhere. The hill-crests
were clear, and the edge of the visible woodland, and the
top half of the ship's shining hull rose clear of curiously-tinted,
slowly writhing fog. But everything else seemed submerged
in a sea of milk.</p>

<p>But the mist grew thinner as the sun shone on it. Its
top writhed to nothingness. All this was wholly commonplace.
Even clouds in the sky were of types well-known
enough. Which was, when one thought about it, inevitable.
This was a Sol-type sun, of the same kind and color as the
star which warmed the planet Earth. It had planets, like
the sun of men's home world. There was a law&mdash;Bode's
Law&mdash;which specified that planets must float in orbits
bearing such-and-such relationships to each other. There
must also be a law that planets in those orbits must bear
such-and-such relationships of size to each other. There
must be a law that winds must blow under ordinary conditions,
and clouds form at appointed heights and times. It
would be very remarkable if Earth were an exception to
natural laws that other worlds obey.</p>

<p>So the strangeness of the morning to those who watched
from the ship was more like the strangeness of an alien
land on Earth than that of a wholly alien planet.</p>

<p>The lower dawnmist thinned. Gazing down, Cochrane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
saw dark masses moving slowly past the ship's three metal
landing-fins. They were the beasts of the night, moving
deliberately from their bed-ground to the vast plains inland.
There were bunches of hundreds, and bunches of
scores. There were occasional knots of dozens only.</p>

<p>From overhead and through the mist Cochrane could
not see individual animals too clearly, but they were heavy
beasts and clumsy ones. They moved sluggishly. Their numbers
dwindled. He saw groups of no more than four or five.
He saw single animals trudging patiently away.</p>

<p>He saw no more at all.</p>

<p>Then the sunlight touched the inland hills. The last
of the morning mist dissolved, and there were the dead
bodies of two beasts near the base of the ship. Johnny
Simms had killed them with his first panicky shots of the
night. There was another dead beast a quarter-mile away.</p>

<p>Cochrane gave orders. Jones and Al could not leave
the ship. They were needed to get it back to Earth, with
full knowledge of how to make other <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Hyphen removed to correspond with other usage in text.">starships</ins>. Cochrane
tried to leave Babs behind, but she would not stay. Bell
had loaded himself with a camera and film-tape besides a
weapon, before Cochrane even began his organization.
Holden was needed for an extra gun. Alicia, tearless and
despairing, would not be left behind. Cochrane turned
wryly to Jamison.</p>

<p>"I don't think Johnny was killed," he said. "He'd gotten
a long way off before it happened, anyhow. We've got to
hunt for him. With beasts like those of last night, there'll
naturally be other creatures to prey on them. We might
run into anything. If we don't get back, you get to the
lawyers I've had representing Spaceways. They'll get rich
off the job, but you'll end up rich, too."</p>

<p>"The best bet all around," said Jamison in a low tone,
"would be to find him trampled to death."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Cochrane sourly. "But apparently the
beasts don't stampede. Maybe they don't even charge, but
just form rings to protect their females and young, like
musk-oxen. I'm afraid he's alive, but I'm also afraid we'll
never find him."</p>

<p>He marshaled his group. Jones had walkie-talkies ready,
deftly removed for the purpose from space-suits nobody
had used since leaving Lunar City&mdash;and Holden took one
to keep in touch by. They went down in the sling, two at
a time.</p>

<p>Cochrane regarded the two dead animals near the base<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of the ship. They were roughly the size of cattle, and they
were shaggy like buffalo. They had branching, pointed,
deadly horns. They had hoofs, single hoofs, not cloven.
They were not like any Earth animal. But horns and hoofs
will appear in any system of parallel evolution. It would
seem even more certain that proteins and amino acids and
such compounds as hemoglobin and fat and muscle-tissue
should be identical as a matter of chemical inevitability.
These creatures had teeth and they were herbivorous. Bell
photographed them painstakingly.</p>

<p>"Somehow," said Cochrane, "I think they'd be wholesome
food. If we can, we'll empty a freezing-locker and
take a carcass for tests."</p>

<p>Holden fingered his rifle unhappily. Alicia said nothing.
Babs stayed close beside her. They went on.</p>

<p>They came to another dead animal a quarter-mile away.
The ground was full of the scent and the hoofmarks of the
departed herd. Bell photographed again. They did not stop.
Johnny Simms had been this way, because of the carcass.
He wasn't here now.</p>

<p>They topped the next rise in the ground. They saw two
other slaughtered creatures. It was wholly evident, now,
that these animals did not charge but only stood their
ground when alarmed. Johnny Simms had fired blindly
when he blundered into their groupings.</p>

<p>The last carcass they saw was barely two hundred yards
from the one patch of woodland visible from the ship.
Cochrane said with some grimness.</p>

<p>"If his eyes had gotten used to the darkness, he might
have seen the forest and tried to get into it to get away
from those animals."</p>

<p>And if Johnny Simms had not stopped short instantly
he reached the woods and presumable safety, he would be
utterly lost by now. There could be nothing less hopeful
than the situation of a man lost on a strange planet, not
knowing in what direction he had blundered on his first
starting out. Even nearby, three directions out of four
would be wrong. Farther away, the chance of stumbling on
the way back to the ship would be nonexistent.</p>

<p>Alicia saw a human footprint on the trodden muck near
the last carcass. It pointed toward the wood.</p>

<p>They reached the wood, and search looked hopeless.
Then by purest chance they found a place where Johnny
had stumbled and fallen headlong. He'd leaped up and fled
crazily. For some fifteen yards they could track him by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
trampled dried small growths he'd knocked down in his
flight. Then there were no more such growths. All signs
of his flight were lost. But they went on.</p>

<p>There were strangenesses everywhere, of which they
could realize only a small part because they had been city-dwellers
back on Earth. There was one place where trees
grew like banyans, and it was utterly impossible to penetrate
them. They swerved aside. There was another spot
where giant trees like sequoias made a cathedral-like atmosphere,
and it seemed an impiety to speak. But Holden
reported tonelessly in the walkie-talkie, and assured Jones
and Al and Jamison that all so far was well.</p>

<p>They heard a vast commotion of chattering voices, and
they hoped that it might be a disturbance of Johnny Simms'
causing. But when they reached the place there was dead
silence. Only, there were hundreds of tiny nests everywhere.
They could not catch a glimpse of a single one of
the nests' inhabitants, but they felt that they were peeked
at from under leaves and around branches.</p>

<p>Cochrane looked unhappy indeed. In cold blood, he
knew that Johnny Simms had left the ship in exactly the
sort of resentful bravado with which a spoiled little boy will
run away from home to punish his parents. Quite possibly
he had intended only to go out into the night and wait
near the ship until he was missed. But he'd found himself
among the unknown beasts. He'd gone into blind panic.
Now he was lost indeed.</p>

<p>But one could not refuse to search for him simply
because it was hopeless. Cochrane could not imagine doing
any less than continuing to search as long as Alicia had
hope. She might hope on indefinitely.</p>

<p>They heard the faint, distant, incisive sound of a shot.</p>

<p>Holden's voice reported it in the walkie-talkie. Cochrane
nodded brightly to Alicia and fired a shot in turn. He
was relieved. It looked like everything would end in a commonplace
fashion. The party from the ship headed toward
the source of the other sound.</p>

<p>In half an hour Cochrane was about to fire again. But
they heard the hysterical rat-tat-tat of firing. It seemed no
nearer, but it could only be Johnny Simms.</p>

<p>Cochrane and Holden fired together for assurance to
Johnny. Bell took pictures.</p>

<p>Again they marched toward where the shots had been
fired. Again they trudged on for a long time. Seemingly,
Johnny had moved away from them as they followed him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
They breasted a hill, and there was a breeze with the smell
of water in it, and they saw that here the land sloped very
gradually toward the sea, and the sea was in view. It was
infinitely blue and it reached toward the most alluring of
horizons. Between them and the sea there was only low-growing
stuff, brownish and sparse. There was sand underfoot&mdash;a
curious bluish sand. Only here and there did the
dry-seeming vegetation grow higher than their heads.</p>

<p>More shots. Between them and the sea. Cochrane and
Holden fired again.</p>

<p>"What the devil's the matter with the fool?" demanded
Holden irritably. "He knows we're coming! Why doesn't
he stand still or come to meet us?"</p>

<p>Cochrane shrugged. That thought was disturbing him
too. They pressed forward, and suddenly Holden exclaimed.
"That looks like a man! Two men!"</p>

<p>Cochrane caught the barest glimpse of something running
about, far ahead. It looked like naked human flesh.
It was the size of a man. It vanished. Another popped into
view and darted madly out of sight. They did not see the
newcomers.</p>

<p>"He shot something like that, back where we first
landed," said Cochrane grimly. "We'd better hurry!"</p>

<p>They did hurry. There was a last flurry of shooting.
It was automatic fire. It is not wise to shoot on automatic
if one's ammunition is limited, Johnny Simms' firearm chattered
furiously for part of a second. It stopped short. He
couldn't have fired so short a burst. He was out of bullets.</p>

<p>They ran.</p>

<p>When they drew near him, a hooting set up. Things
scattered away. Large things. Birds the size of men. They
heard Johnny Simms screaming.</p>

<p>They came panting to the very beach, on which foam-tipped
waves broke in absolutely normal grandeur. The
sand was commonplace save for a slight bluish tint. Johnny
Simms was out on the beach, in the open. He was down.
He had flung his gun at something and was weaponless.
He lay on the sand, shrieking. There were four ungainly,
monstrous birds like oversized Cornish Game gamecocks
pecking at him. Two ran crazily away at sight of the humans.
Two others remained. Then they fled. One of them
halted, darted back, and took a last peck at Johnny Simms
before it fled again.</p>

<p>Holden fired, and missed. Cochrane ran toward the
kicking, shrieking Johnny Simms. But Alicia got there first.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a completely pitiable object. His clothing had
been almost completely stripped away in the brief time
since his last burst of shots. There were wounds on his bare
flesh. After all, the beak of a bird as tall as a man is not
a weapon to be despised. Johnny Simms would have been
pecked to death but for the party from the ship. He had
been spotted and harried by a huntingpack of the ostrich-sized
creatures at earliest dawn. A cooler-headed man
would have stood still and killed some of them, then the
rest would either have run away or devoured their slaughtered
fellows. But Johnny Simms was not cool-headed. He
had made a career of being a rich man's spoiled little boy.
Now he'd had a fright great enough and an escape narrow
enough to shatter the nerves of a normal man. To Johnny
Simms, the effect was catastrophic.</p>

<p>He could not walk, and the distance was too great to
carry him. Holden reported by walkie-talkie, and Jones
proposed to butcher one of the animals Johnny had killed
and put it in a freezer emptied for the purpose, and then
lift the ship and land by the sea. It seemed a reasonable
proposal. Johnny was surely not seriously wounded.</p>

<p>But that meant time to wait. Alicia sat by her husband,
soothing him. Holden moved along the beach, examining
the shells that had come ashore. He picked up one shell
more glorious in its coloring than any of the pearl-making
creatures of Earth. This shell grew neither in the flat spiral
nor the cone-shaped form of Earth mollusks. It grew in a
doubly-curved spiral, so that the result was an extraordinary,
lustrous, complex sphere. Bell fairly danced with excitement
as he photographed it with lavish pains to get all
the colors just right.</p>

<p>Cochrane and Babs moved along the beach also. It was
not possible to be apprehensive. Cochrane talked largely.
Presently he was saying with infinite satisfaction:</p>

<p>"The chemical compounds here are bound to be the
same! It's a new world, bigger than the glacier planet.
Those beasts last night&mdash;if they're good food-stuff&mdash;will
make this a place like the old west, and everybody envies
the pioneers! This is a new Earth! Everything's so nearly
the same&mdash;."</p>

<p>"I never," observed Babs, "heard of blue sand on
Earth."</p>

<p>He frowned at her. He stooped and picked up a handful
of the beach stuff. It was not blue. The tiny, sea-broken
pebbles were ordinary quartz and granite rock. They would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
have to be. Yet there was a blueness&mdash;The blue grains
were very much smaller than the white and tan and gray
ones. Cochrane looked closely. Then he blew. All the sand
blew out of his hand except&mdash;at last&mdash;one tiny grain. It
was white. It glittered greasily. Cochrane moved four paces
and wetted his hand in the sea. He tried to wet the sand-grain.
It would not wet.</p>

<p>He began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I did a show once," he told Babs, "about the old
diamond-mines. Ever hear of them? They used to find diamonds
in blue clay which was as hard as rock. Here, blue
clay goes out from the land to under the waves. This is a
tiny diamond, washed out by the sea! This is the last thing
we need!" Then he looked at his watch. "We're due on the
air in two hours and a half! Now we've got what we want!
Let's go have Holden tell Jones to hurry!"</p>

<p>But Babs complained suddenly,</p>

<p>"Jed! What sort of life am I going to lead with you?
Here we are, and&mdash;nobody can see us&mdash;and you don't even
notice!"</p>

<p>Cochrane was penitent. In fact, they had to hurry back
down the beach to join the others when the space-ship appeared
as a silvery gleam, high in the air, and then came
swooping down with fierce flames underneath it to settle a
quarter-mile inland.</p>

<p>Bell had a picture of the tiny diamond by the time the
ground was cool enough for them to re-enter the ship. The
way he photographed it, against a background which had
nothing by which its size could be estimated, the little white
stone looked like a Kohinoor. It was two transparent pyramids
set base to base, and he even got color-flashes from it.
And Jamison, forewarned, took pictures from the air of the
blue-sand areas. They showed the tint the one tiny diamond
explained.</p>

<p>The broadcast was highly successful. It began with a
four-minute commercial in which the evils of faulty elimination
were discussed with infinite delicacy, and it was
clearly proved&mdash;to an audience waiting to look beyond the
stars&mdash;that only Greshham's Intestinal Emollient allowed
the body to make full use of vitamins, proteins, and the
very newest enzymatic foundation-substances which everybody
needed for really perfect health. There followed the
approach shots to this planet, shots of the great beast-herds
on the plains, views of luxuriant, waving foliage, the tide
of shaggy animals as they came at dusk to their drinking-place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and there was an all-too-brief picturing of the blue-tinted
soil which the last film-clip of all declared to be
diamondiferous.</p>

<p>Cochrane's direction of this show was almost inspired.
The views of the animal herd were calculated to make any
member of his audience think in simultaneous terms of
glamour and adventure&mdash;with perfect personal safety, of
course!&mdash;and of steaks, chops and roasts. The more gifted
viewers back on Earth might even envision filets mignon.
The infinitesimal diamond with its prismatic glitterings, of
course, roused cupidity of another sort.</p>

<p>There were four commercials cut into these alluring
views, the last was superimposed upon a view Bell had
taken of the sunset-colors. And it might have seemed that
the television audience would confuse the charm of the new
world as pictured with the product insistently praised. But
the public was pretty well toughened up against commercials
nowadays. It was not deceived. As usual, it only
deceived itself.</p>

<p>But there was no deception about the fact that there
was a new and unoccupied planet fit for human habitation.
That was true. And the fretting overcrowded cities immediately
became places where everybody made happy plans
for his neighbor to move there. But the more irritable
people would begin to think vaguely that it might be worth
going to, for themselves.</p>

<p>The ship took off two hours after the broadcast. Part of
that time was taken up with astrogational conferences with
astronomers on Earth. Cochrane had this conference taped
for the auxiliary broadcast-program in which the audience
shared the problems as well as the triumphs of the star-voyagers.
Cochrane wanted to get back to Earth. So far
as television was concerned, it would be unwise. The ship
and its crew would travel indefinitely without a lack of
sponsors. But for once, Cochrane agreed entirely with
Holden.</p>

<p>"We're heading back," he told Babs, "because if we
keep on, people will accept our shows as just another
superior kind of escape-entertainment. They'll have the
dream quality of 'You Win a Million' and the lottery-shows.
They'll be things to dream about but never to think
of doing anything about. We're going to make the series
disappointingly short, in order to make it more convincingly
factual. We won't spin it out for its entertainment-value
until it practically loses everything else."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Babs. She put her hand in his. She'd found
it necessary to remind him, now and then.</p>

<p>So the ship started home. And it would not return
direct to Earth&mdash;or Lunar City&mdash;for a very definite reason.
Cochrane meant to have all his business affairs neatly
wrapped up before landing. They could get another show
or two across, and some highly involved contracts could be
haggled to completion more smoothly if one of the parties&mdash;Spaceways,
Inc.&mdash;was not available except when it felt
like being available. The other parties would be more
anxious.</p>

<p>So the astrogation-conference did not deal with a direct
return to Earth, but with a small sol-type star not too far
out of the direct line. The Pole Star could have been visited,
but it was a double star. Cochrane had no abstract scientific
curiosity. His approach was strictly that of a man of business.
He did the business.</p>

<p>There was, of course, a suitable pause not too far from
the second planet&mdash;the planet of the shaggy beasts. They
put out a plastic balloon with a Dabney field generator
inside it. It would float in emptiness indefinitely. The field
would hold for not less than twenty years. It would serve
as a beacon, a highway, a railroad track through space for
other ships planning to visit the third world now available
to men. Ultimately, better arrangements could be made.</p>

<p>Jones was already ecstatically designing ground-level
Dabney field installations. There would be Dabney fields
extending from star to star. Along them, as along pneumatic
tubes, ships would travel at unthinkable speeds toward
absolutely certain destinations. True, at times they
could not be used because of the bulk of planets between
starting-points and landing-stations. But with due attention
to scheduling, it would be a simple matter indeed to arrange
for something close to commuters' service between
star-clusters. He explained all this to Cochrane, with
Holden listening in.</p>

<p>"Oh, surely!" said Cochrane cynically. "And you'll have
tax-payers objecting because you make money. You'll be
regulated out of existence. Were you thinking that Spaceways
would run this transportation system you're planning,
without cutting anybody else in on even the glory of it?"</p>

<p>Jones looked at him, dead-pan. But he was annoyed.</p>

<p>"I want some money," he said. "I thought we could get
this thing set up, and then I could get myself a ship and
facilities for doing some really original work. I'd like to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
work something out and not have to sell the publicity-rights
to it!"</p>

<p>"I'll arrange it," promised Cochrane. "I've got our lawyers
setting up a deal right now. You're going to get as
many tricky patents as you can on this field, and assign
them all to Spaceways. And Spaceways is going to assign
them all to a magnificent Space Development Association,
a sort of Chamber of Commerce for all the outer planets,
and all the stuffed shirts in creation are going to leap madly
to get honorary posts on it. And it will be practically
beyond criticism, and it will have the public interest passionately
at its heart, and it will be practically beyond
interference and it will be as inefficient as hell! And the
more inefficient it is, the more it will have to take in to
allow for its inefficiency&mdash;and for your patents it has to
give us a flat cut of its gross! And meanwhile we'll get
ours from the planets we've landed on and publicized.
We've got customers. We've built up a market for our
planets!"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Jones in frank astonishment.</p>

<p>"We," said Cochrane, "rate as first inhabitants and
therefore proprietors and governments of the first two
planets ever landed on beyond Earth. When the Moon-colony
was formed, there were elaborate laws made to take
care of surviving nation prides and so on. Whoever first
stays on a planet a full rotation is its proprietor and government&mdash;until
other inhabitants arrive. Then the government
is all of them, but the proprietorship remains with
the first. We own two planets. Nice planets. Glamorized
planets, too! So I've already made deals for the hotel-concessions
on the glacier world."</p>

<p>Holden had listened with increasing uneasiness. Now
he said doggedly:</p>

<p>"That's not right, Jed! I don't mind making money,
but there are things that are more important! Millions of
people back home&mdash;hundreds of millions of poor devils&mdash;spend
their lives scared to death of losing their jobs, not
daring to hope for more than bare subsistence! I want to do
something for them! People need hope, Jed, simply to be
healthy! Maybe I'm a fool, but the human race needs
hope more than I need money!"</p>

<p>Cochrane looked patient.</p>

<p>"What would you suggest?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Holden heavily, "that we ought to give
what we've got to the world. Let the governments of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
world take over and assist emigration. There's not one but
will be glad to do it ..."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," said Cochrane, "you are perfectly right.
They would! There have been resettlement projects and
such stuff for generations. I'm very much afraid that just
what you propose will be done to some degree somewhere
or other on other planets as they're turned up. But on the
glacier planet there will be hotels. The rich will want to go
there to stay, to sight-see, to ride, to hunt, to ski, and to
fly in helicopters over volcanoes. The hotels will need to be
staffed. There will be guides and foresters and hunters. It
will cost too much to bring food from Earth, so farms will
be started. It will be cheaper to buy food from independent
farmers than to raise it with hired help. So the farmers will
be independent. There will have to be stores to supply them
with what they need, and tourists with what they don't need
but want. From the minute the glacier planet starts up as
a tourist resort, there will be jobs for hundreds of people.
It won't be long before there are jobs for thousands.
There'll be a man-shortage there. Anybody who wants to
can go there to work, and if he doesn't go there expecting
a certified, psychologically conditioned environment, but
just a good job with possible or probable advancement ...
That's the environment we humans want! Presently
the hotels won't even be tourist hotels. They'll just be the
normal hotels that exist everywhere that there are cities
and people moving about among them! Then it won't be
a tourist-planet, and tourists will be a nuisance. It'll be
home for one hell of a lot of people! And they'll have
made every bit of it themselves!"</p>

<p>Holden said uncomfortably:</p>

<p>"It'll be slow ..."</p>

<p>"It'll be sure!" snapped Cochrane. "The first settlements
in America were failures until the people started to work
for themselves! Look at this planet we're leaving! How
many people will come to work that silly diamond mine!
How many will hunt to supply them with meat? How many
will farm to supply the hunters and the miners with other
food? And how many others will be along to run stores
and manufacture things ..." He made an impatient
gesture. "You're thinking of encouraging people to move
to the stars to make more room on Earth. You'd get nice
passive colonists who'd obediently move because the long-hairs
said it was wise and the government paid for it. I'm
thinking of colonists who'll fight and quite possibly cheat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and lie a little to get jobs where they can take care of their
families the way they want to! I want people to move to
get what they want in spite of any discouragement anybody
throws at them. Now shoo! I'm busy!"</p>

<p>Jones asked mildly:</p>

<p>"At what?"</p>

<p>"The latest proposed deal," said Cochrane impatiently,
"is for rights to bore for oil. The uranium concessions are
farmed out. Water-power is pending&mdash;not for cash, but a
cut&mdash;and&mdash;."</p>

<p>Holden said uneasily:</p>

<p>"There's one other thing, Jed. All your plans and all
your scheming could still be blocked if back on Earth they
think we might bring plagues back to Earth. Remember
Dabney suggested that? And some biologist or other agreed
with him?"</p>

<p>Cochrane grinned.</p>

<p>"There's a diamond-mine. There are herds of what
people will call cattle. There's food and riches. There's
scenery and adventure. There's room to do things! Nobody
could keep political office if he tried to keep his constituents
from food and cash and adventure&mdash;even by proxy
when they send expendable Cousin Albert out to see if he
can make a living there. We've got to take reasonable precautions
against germs, of course. We'll have trouble enforcing
them. But we'll manage!"</p>

<p>Al called down from the control-room. The ship was
sufficiently aligned, he thought, for their next stopping-place.
He wanted Jones to charge the booster-circuit and
flash it over. Jones went.</p>

<p>A little later there was the peculiar sensation of a sound
that was not a sound, but was felt all through one. The
result was not satisfactory. The ship was still in empty
space, and the nearest star was still a star. There was a
repetition of the booster-jump. Still not too good. Thereafter
the ship drove, and jumped, and jumped, and drove.</p>

<p>Jamison came down to where Cochrane conducted
business via communicator. He waited. Cochrane said:</p>

<p>"Dammit, I won't agree! I want twelve per cent or I
take up another offer!&mdash;What?"</p>

<p>The last was to Jamison. Jamison said uneasily:</p>

<p>"We found another planet. About Earth-size. Ice-caps.
Clouds. Oceans. Seas. Even rivers! But there's no green
on it! It's all bare rocks!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Cochrane thought concentratedly. Then he said impatiently:</p>

<p>"The whiskered people back home said that life couldn't
have gotten started on all the planets suited for it. They
said there must be planets where life hasn't reached, though
they're perfectly suited for it. Make a landing and try the
air with algae like we did on the first planet."</p>

<p>He turned back to the communicator.</p>

<p>"You reason," he snapped to a man on far-away Earth,
"that all this is only on paper. But that's the only reason
you're getting a chance at it! I'll guarantee that Jones will
install drives on ships that meet our requirements of space-worthiness&mdash;or
government standards, whichever are
strictest&mdash;for ten per cent of your company stock plus
twelve per cent cash of the cost of each ship. Nothing less!"</p>

<p>He heard the rockets make the louder sound that was
the symptom of descent against gravity.</p>

<p>The world was lifeless. The ship had landed on bare
stone, when Cochrane looked out the control-room ports.
There had been trouble finding a flat space on which the
three landing-fins would find a suitable foundation. It had
taken half an hour of maneuvering to locate such a place
and to settle solidly on it. Then the look of things was
appalling.</p>

<p>The landing-spot was a naked mass of what seemed to
be basalt polygons, similar to the Giants' Causeway of Ireland
back on Earth. There was no softness anywhere. The
stone which on other planets underlay soil, here showed
harshly. There was no soil. There was no microscopic life
to nibble at rocks and make soil in which less minute life
could live. The nudity of the stones led to glaring colors
everywhere. The colors were brilliant as nowhere else but
on Earth's moon. There was no vegetation at all.</p>

<p>That was somehow shocking. The ship's company stared
and stared, but there could be no comment. There was a
vast, dark sea to the left of the landing-place. Inland there
were mountains and valleys. But the mountains were not
sloped. There were heaps of detritus at the bases of their
cliffs, but it was simply detritus. No tiniest patch of lichen
grew anywhere. No blade of grass. No moss. No leaf.
Nothing.</p>

<p>The air was empty. Nothing flew. There were clouds,
to be sure. The sky was even blue, though a darker blue
than Earth's, because there was no vegetation to break
stone down to dust, or to form dust by its own decay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The sea was violently active. Great waves flung themselves
toward the harsh coastline and beat upon it with
insensate violence. They shattered into masses of foam.
But the foam broke&mdash;too quickly&mdash;and left the surging
water dark again. Far down the line of foam there were
dark clouds, and rain fell in masses, and lightning flashed.
But it was a scene of desolation which was somehow more
horrible even than the scarred and battered moon of Earth.</p>

<p>Cochrane looked out very carefully. Alicia came to him,
a trifle hesitant.</p>

<p>"Johnny's asleep now. He didn't sleep at first, and while
we were out of gravity he was unhappy. But he went off to
sleep the instant we landed. He needs rest. Could we&mdash;just
stay landed here until he catches up on sleep?"</p>

<p>Cochrane nodded. Alicia smiled at him and went away.
There was still the mark of a bruise on her cheek. She went
down to where her husband needed her. Holden said
dourly:</p>

<p>"This world's useless. So is her husband."</p>

<p>"Wait till we check the air," said Cochrane absently.</p>

<p>"I've checked it," Holden told him indifferently. "I
went in the port and sniffed at the cracked outer door. I
didn't die, so I opened the door. There is a smell of stone.
That's all. The air's perfectly breathable. The ocean's
probably absorbed all soluble gases, and poisonous gases
are soluble. If they weren't, they couldn't be poisonous."</p>

<p>"Mmmmmm," said Cochrane thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Jamison came over to him.</p>

<p>"We're not going to stay here, are we?" he asked. "I
don't like to look at it. The moon's bad enough, but at least
nothing could live there! Anything could live here. But it
doesn't! I don't like it!"</p>

<p>"We'll stay here at least while Johnny has a nap. I do
want Bell to take all the pictures he can, though. Probably
not for broadcast, but for business reasons. I'll need pictures
to back up a deal."</p>

<p>Jamison went away. Holden said without interest:</p>

<p>"You'll make no deals with this planet! This is one
you can do what you like with! I don't want any part of it!"</p>

<p>Cochrane shrugged.</p>

<p>"Speaking of things you don't want any part of&mdash;what
about Johnny Simms? Speaking as a psychiatrist, what
effect will that business of being in the dark all night and
nearly being pecked to death&mdash;what will it do to him?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Are psychopaths the way they are because they can't face
reality, or because they've never had to?"</p>

<p>Holden stared away down the incredible, lifeless coastline
at the distant storm. There was darkness under many
layers of cloud. The sea foamed and lashed and instantly
was free of foam again. Because there were no plankton,
no animalcules, no tiny, gluey, organic beings in it to give
the water the property of making foam which endured.
There was thunder, yonder in the storm, and no ear heard
it. Over a vast world there was sunshine which no eyes saw.
There was night in which nothing rested, and somewhere
dawn was breaking now, and nothing sang.</p>

<p>"Look at that, Jed," said Holden heavily. "There's a
reality none of us wants to face! We're all more or less
fugitives from what we are afraid is reality. That is real,
and it makes me feel small and futile. So I don't like to
look at it. Johnny Simms didn't want to face what one does
grow up to face. It made him feel futile. So he picked a
pleasanter role than realist."</p>

<p>Cochrane nodded.</p>

<p>"But his unrealism of last night put him into a very
realistic mess that he couldn't dodge! Will it change him?"</p>

<p>"Probably," said Holden without any expression at all in
his voice. "They used to put lunatics in snake-pits. When
they were people who'd taken to lunacy for escape from
reality, it made them go back to reality to escape from the
snakes. Shock-treatments used to be used, later, for the
same effect. We're too soft to use either treatment now. But
Johnny gave himself the works. The odds are that from
now on he will never want to be alone even for an instant,
and he will never again quite dare to be angry with anybody
or make anybody angry. You choked him and he ran
away, and it was bad! So from now on I'd guess that
Johnny will be a very well-behaved little boy in a grown
man's body." He said very wryly indeed, "Alicia will be
very happy, taking care of him."</p>

<p>A moment later he added:</p>

<p>"I look at that set-up the way I look at the landscape
yonder."</p>

<p>Cochrane said nothing. Holden liked Alicia. Too much.
It would not make any difference at all. After a moment,
though, he changed the subject.</p>

<p>"I think this is a pretty good bet, this planet. You think
it's no good. I'm going to talk to the chlorella companies.
They grow edible yeast in tanks, and chlorella in vats, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
they produce an important amount of food. But they have
to grow the stuff indoors and they have a ghastly job keeping
everything sterile. Here's a place where they can sow
chlorella in the oceans! They can grow yeast in lakes, out-of-doors!
Suppose they use this world to grow monstrous
quantities of unattractive but useful foodstuff&mdash;in a way&mdash;wild?
It will be good return-cargo material for ships taking
colonists out to our other planets.&mdash;I suppose," he added
meditatively, "they'll ship it back in bulk, dried."</p>

<p>Holden blinked. He was jolted out of even his depression.</p>

<p>"Jed!" he said warmly. "Tell that to the world&mdash;prove
that&mdash;and&mdash;people will stop being afraid! They won't be
afraid of starving before they can get to the stars! Jed&mdash;Jed!
This is the thing the world needs most of all!"</p>

<p>But Cochrane grimaced.</p>

<p>"Maybe," he admitted it. "But I've tasted the stuff. I
think it's foul! Still, if people want it ..."</p>

<p>He went back down to the communicator to contact
the chlorella companies of Earth, to find out if there was
any special data they would need to pass on the proposal.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And so presently the ship took off for home. It landed
on the moon first, and Johnny Simms was loaded into a
space-suit and transferred to Lunar City, where he could
live without being extradited back to Earth. He wouldn't
stay there. Alicia guaranteed that. They'd move to the
glacier planet as soon as hotels were built. Maybe some day
they'd travel to the planet of the shaggy beasts. Johnny
would never be troublesome again. He was pathetically
anxious, now, to have people like him, and stay with him,
and not under any circumstances be angry with him or shut
him away from them. Alicia would now have a full-time
occupation keeping people from taking advantage of him.</p>

<p>But the ship went back to Earth. And on Earth Jamison
became the leading television personality of all time, describing
and extrapolating the delicious dangers and the
splendid industrial opportunities of star-travel. Bell was his
companion and co-star. Presently Jamison conceded privately
to Cochrane that he and Bell would need shortly
to take off on another journey of exploration with some
other expedition. Neither of them thought to retire, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
they were well-off enough. They were stock-holders in the
Spaceways company, which guaranteed them a living.</p>

<p>Cochrane put Spaceways, Inc., into full operation. He
fought savagely against personal publicity, but he worked
himself half to death. He spent hours every day in frenzied
haggling, and in the cynical examination of deftly booby-trapped
business proposals. His lawyers insisted that he
needed an office&mdash;he did&mdash;and presently he had four secretaries
and there developed an entire hierarchy of persons
under him. One day his chief secretary told him commiseratingly
that somebody had waited two hours past
appointment-time to see him.</p>

<p>It was Hopkins, who had not been willing to interrupt
his dinner to listen to a protest from Cochrane. Hopkins
was still exactly as important as ever. It was only that
Cochrane was more so.</p>

<p>It woke Cochrane up. He stormed, to Babs, and ruthlessly
cancelled appointments and abandoned or transferred
enterprises, and made preparations for a more
satisfactory way of life.</p>

<p>They went, in time, to the Spaceways terminal, to take
ship for the stars. The terminal was improvised, but it was
busy. Already eighteen ships a day went away from there
in Dabney fields. Eighteen others arrived. Jones was already
off somewhere in a ship built according to his own
notions. Officially he was doing research for Spaceways,
Inc., but actually nobody told him what to do. He puttered
happily with improbable contrivances and sometimes got
even more improbable results. Holden was already off of
Earth. He was on the planet of the shaggy beasts, acting
as consultant on the cases of persons who arrived there
and became emotionally disturbed because they could do
as they pleased, instead of being forced by economic necessity
to do otherwise.</p>

<p>But this day Babs and Cochrane went together into the
grand concourse of the Spaceways terminal. There were
people everywhere. The hiring-booths of enterprises on the
three planets now under development took applications for
jobs on those remote worlds, and explained how long one
had to contract to work in order to have one's fare paid.
Chambers of Commerce representatives were prepared to
give technical information to prospective entrepreneurs.
There were reservation-desks, and freight-routing desks,
and tourist-agency desks ...</p>

<p>"Hmmm," said Cochrane suddenly. "D'you know, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
haven't heard of Dabney in months! What happened to
him?"</p>

<p>"Dabney?" said Babs. She beamed. Women in the
terminal saw the clothes she was wearing. They did not
recognize her&mdash;Cochrane had kept her off the air&mdash;but
they envied her. She felt very nice indeed. "Dabney?&mdash;Oh,
I had to use my own judgment there, Jed. You were so
busy! After all, he was scientific consultant to Spaceways.
He did pay Jones cold cash for fame-rights. When everything
else got so much more important than just the scientific
theory, he got in a terrible state. His family consulted
Doctor Holden, and we arranged it. He's right down this
way!"</p>

<p>She pointed. And there was a splendid plate-glass office
built out from the wall of the grand concourse. It was elevated,
so that it was charmingly conspicuous. There was a
chastely designed but highly visible sign under the stairway
leading to it. The sign said; "<i>H. G. Dabney, Scientific Consultant.</i>"</p>

<p>Dabney sat at an imposing desk in plain view of all the
thousands who had shipped out and the millions who would
ship out in time to come. He thought, visibly. Presently he
stood up and paced meditatively up and down the office
which was as eye-catching as a gold-fish bowl of equal size
in the same place. He seemed to see someone down in the
concourse. He could have recognized Cochrane, of course.
But he did not.</p>

<p>He bowed. He was a great man. Undoubtedly he returned
to his wife each evening happily convinced that he
had done the world a great favor by permitting it to
glimpse him.</p>

<p>Cochrane and Babs went on. Their baggage was taken
care of. The departure of a ship for the stars, these days,
was much less complicated and vastly more comfortable
than it used to be when a mere moon-rocket took off.</p>

<p>When they were in the ship, Babs heaved a sigh of
absolute relief.</p>

<p>"Now," she said zestfully, "now you're retired, Jed!
You don't have to worry about anything! And so now I'm
going to try to make you worry about me&mdash;not worry
about me, but think about me!"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Cochrane. He regarded her with
honest affection. "We'll take a good long vacation. First
on the glacier planet. Then we'll build a house somewhere
in the hills back of Diamondville ..."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jed!" said Babs accusingly.</p>

<p>"There's a fair population there already," said Cochrane,
apologetically. "It won't be long before a local television
station will be logical. I was just thinking, Babs, that after
we get bored with loafing, I could start a program there.
Really sound stuff. Not commercial. And of course with
the Dabney field it could be piped back to Earth if any
sponsor wanted it. I think they would ..."</p>

<p>Presently the ship with Babs and Cochrane among its
passengers took off to the stars. It was a perfectly routine
flight. After all, star-travel was almost six months old. It
wasn't a novelty any longer.</p>

<p>Operation Outer Space was old stuff.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
