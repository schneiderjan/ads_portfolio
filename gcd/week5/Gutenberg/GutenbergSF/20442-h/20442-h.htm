<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>For years this writer's aim was to visualize
the armed Pennsylvanian of earlier days; how he
went forth to fight his Indian foe, to slay the
bison, moose, elk and smaller game, and on his
expeditions to the fields of love: where his firearms
and edged weapons originated. To create
the living man his arms must be secured, and
gradually the present collection was assembled.
And he lived again, dark, grim, bearded, the
spirit of lofty pines and hemlocks among which
he spent his days, always plotting to kill something.
Many of the arms, if they could speak,
what tales of war, the chase, and love adventure
they could tell! The Pennsylvania woodsman
was filled with the romance of slaughter, a heritage
of mingled Continental origins, Huguenot,
Spanish, Portuguese, Swiss, Waldensian, Levantine,
with the strains of Ulster Scot, Alsatian,
Palatine, Hollander and Moravian, cooling
cross currents in his veins. No wonder that
the women of this blended race were the most
darkly beautiful in the world, and a group of
the curious edged weapons they carried to destroy
men who annoyed them might well be the
subject of another separate collection. But the
arms stacked in silent panoply, or the daggers,
dirks and powder flasks, would not suffice to
give the collection the answer to the questions
it involved. Along with a group of daring Alpinists
to "Restless Oaks" came H. Beam
Piper, of Altoona, Pa., a modern master-of-arms,
who patiently set to work to describe the collection
from its oldest to its newest examples. As
the results of his intelligent energy and research
the following catalogue has been prepared which
gives us the skeleton figure of the armed Pennsylvania
mountain man, from the frontier days
until later and more prosaic times ensued. While
many of the arms listed are in imperfect condition
and some of the more important ones are
lacking, they give the idea of his times. Other
pieces of later periods, and a few of foreign use,
are included for purposes of comparison. To
these are added Mr. Piper's catalogue of his
own collection, all in perfect order, to show similar
types of weapons at their best. While, as
stated, there are many specimens missing, these
vacancies emphasize the wide range of weapons
used by the old-time Pennsylvanians. The frequent
wars kept bringing new types of arms into
the wilderness and new ideas for weapons
among the woodsmen themselves, and this was
most noteworthy after the Civil War, which was
also the end of the grand romantic period of the
Pennsylvania wilderness. The mountaineer of
Pennsylvania was of martial blood, his ancestors
had fought in every state of Continental
Europe&mdash;and the science of armorer was his
birthright. David Lewis, the "Galloping Jack"
or highwayman of Central Pennsylvania, used
new pistols every year, and weapons which he is
said to have carried are as plentiful as Ole Bull's
violins. The frontiersmen of British origins always
named their favorite rifles "My Friend,"
"My Brother," "Sure Shot," "Confidence,"
"Never Fail," "Carry My Wish," "Kill Deer,"
and "Kill Buck," and cherished them almost as
living things. Many of them camped out at the
wayside gunshops until a specially ordered
weapon was begun and finished, so as to supervise
every detail of its fabrication. Quaint and
full of historic lore were these mystic wayside
shrines of arms, which are alas with a few exceptions
no more. Billy de Shera's on Larry's
Creek near Jersey Shore instilled the love of
arms in several generations of mountain boys,
and the last gunshops in existence, those of Seth
Nelson, Jr., near Round Island, Clinton County,
and David C. Busler, near Collomsville, Lycoming
County, have had arms loving pilgrims of
note from all over the State to learn the last
dying secrets of the Kentucky rifles, which, despite
their name, were mostly made in Pennsylvania.
Often the backwoods arms enthusiast
would insist that the shutters be closed and the
smith's work carried on by candle-light, lest a
passing hechs cast a glance upon the barrel,
which would ever afterward be deprived of the
power to kill. The proud owner of a cherished
gun would never leave it near a hechs, lest she
run her cold trembling hand along the barrel
and forever destroy its accuracy. There were
also spells or pow-wowing to make a gun shoot
perfectly, and these were put on before a foe was
to be removed, and more especially with the
heavy rifles used at shooting matches. Needles
and papers written full of incantations were
slipped under the barrels where they joined the
stocks to keep away the witches. The writer
has seen Robert Covenhoven's rifle with thirteen
notches on the under side of the stock. His
scalping-knife has seven notches, where this
merciless scalp-hunter enumerated his red victims
prior to collecting the scalp bounty at
Harris' Ferry. The Covenhoven rifle was latterly
owned by the old deer-hunter Miller Day,
of English Centre, Lycoming County, but is now
in Philadelphia, while the knife is at the James
V. Brown Library, Williamsport, together with
his Ketland pistol. As symbols of a bolder and
broader day the firearms of backwoods Pennsylvania
will always exercise a peculiar charm,
typifying as they do the period of trackless forests,
Indians, panthers, wolves, unbridled romance.
Also, that strangely picturesque period of
the Civil War, when the sharp-shooting Pennsylvania
mountain boys (and older ones) went
forth to snip; for did not Jake Karstetter, of
Sugar Valley, Clinton County, enlist as 37 when
he was 57 and compass the death of seven Confederate
general officers? Notched on the walnut
stock of his favorite weapon, the work of
Henry Barner, a wayside Sugar Valley gunsmith,
were seven sets of minute carvings in the form
of collar insignias in all the grades from a Lieutenant
General to a Lieutenant Colonel. And
when they led him haltered through the streets
of Richmond they labelled him "a wild Yankee
from the North," because of his unshorn hair
and beard, which he swore he would not cut
until he had "set Jeff Davis cold." It is a pity
that the science of ancient arms is not more
popular in inland Pennsylvania, and that more
of the curious specimens of arms have not been
retained, but were allowed to be shipped away
to collectors elsewhere before their local value
was recognized. It is with a hope that it may
stimulate other collectors at home to assemble
ancient weapons before it is too late that this
catalogue has been published. It is as a fragment,
and not as a complete collection, but it
puts before the reader the picture of an arms
loving race, in the glorious ante-mollycoddle
age, which was the golden age of Pennsylvania
manhood. But in truth there has been very
little, if any, decline, when one thinks of the
valor of the boys of the 28th, the 79th and other
outfits where Pennsylvanians were most in evidence
in the World War. Many of these had old
Civil War grandfathers, who could tell of Fredericksburg
or Petersburg, of how earlier they
barked squirrels on tall hardwood trees, or shot
into the flocks of wild pigeons "which darkened
the sun" in their great flights. And to welcome
in the "apostolic succession" of arms new lovers
among our boys, even the least of them, this
collection stands catalogued, thanks to Mr.
Piper's perseverance. It is an invitation and
appeal to carry on all that is boldest, bravest
and best of that fearless company that bore
their spears along the dark warpaths of obscurity,
and stacked them on the campgrounds of
eternal night.</p>

<h2>
THE SHOEMAKER COLLECTION OF EARLY PENNSYLVANIA<br />
AND OTHER FIREARMS AND EDGED WEAPONS.</h2>

<p>1. EXTREMELY HEAVY SHARPSHOOTER'S OR TARGET RIFLE.<span class="long">L. 52-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Full length stock with small cheek-piece and
flattened at muzzle for shooting from a rest.

<p>Octagon barrel, half stock, small brass patch-box,
brass and German silver mountings. Peep-and-globe
sights, rear sight missing. Fitted
with false muzzle for loading. Lock marked
"Warranted". About .38 cal. Complete with tin
box containing all original accessories, mould,
bullet-starter, patch cutter, combination screwdriver
and nipple wrench, patches, tow for cleaning,
etc. Rare with original accessories. This
is the type of gun used at the old-time "turkey
shoots." Made in Berks County, for John Lebo,
of Clinton County.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>3. DOUBLE BREECH-LOADING SHOTGUN. <span class="long">L. 48"</span></p>

<p>Side-lever action. Fitted with rifle sights for
shooting round balls. Mark on lock, "Wm.
Moore &amp; Co." On barrel, "Fine Laminated
Steel". 12-bore.</p>

<p>4. VERY SHORT PERCUSSION GUN. <span class="long">L. 36-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Full length black walnut stock. Iron ramrod.
About 60 Cal. No marks. Probably used for
hunting buffalo.</p>

<p>5. KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 57"</span></p>

<p>Percussion. Stock originally full length, but
has been shortened 11-1/2 inches. Brass mounts
and long brass patch-box. Ramrod missing.
About .36 Cal.</p>

<p>6. OLD AND BADLY BATTERED FOWLING PIECE. <span class="long">L. 57"</span></p>

<p>7. HEAVY KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 56"</span></p>

<p>Curley maple stock and brass mountings, including
long brass patch-box. Fairly good order.</p>

<p>8. SMALL-BORE PERCUSSION FOWLING PIECE. <span class="long">L. 59"</span></p>

<p>This gun is of the cheapest sort, with painted
stock of some soft wood. Guns of this kind were
sold by Indian traders and by country merchants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
to farmers' boys and others unable to afford better
arms. Due to the almost uniform abuse
which these weapons received, this specimen,
which is in good condition, is somewhat of a
rarity. Mark on lock, "Henry Parker, Warranted".</p>

<p>9. U. S. ARMY MUSKET, 1822 MODEL. <span class="long">L. 57-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Altered to percussion by Government system
of screwing on new breech. Mexican and Civil

<p>Rigid barrels and two locks. No marks. Ramrod
and trigger-guard missing. Small round
patch-box, and German silver figure of spread
eagle inset in cheek piece.</p>

<p>11. SHORT PERCUSSION RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 49"</span></p>

<p>This rifle is of the type used on the plains,
period of 1845-'50 and in Pennsylvania period of
1850-90. No marks. Long brass patch-box.
About .44 Cal. Fairly good condition.</p>

<p>12. SHORT KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 48-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Stock has been broken and repaired several
times and the whole gun is crudely made and
was evidently the work of an unskilled local
gunsmith. Without doubt, this is an authentic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Pennsylvania Mountain relic. Now a smooth-bore.</p>

<p>13. CUT-DOWN KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 45"</span></p>

<p>Barrel has been smooth-bored and stock
shortened to half-length. Rear sight of peculiar
and artistic design. This was at one time a very
fine gun, and has several interesting features.</p>

<p>14. U. S. ARMY MUSKET, MODEL OF 1822. <span class="long">L. 57-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Has been varnished all over and is in good
condition, but hammer is missing.</p>

<p>15. PERCUSSION KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 52"</span></p>

<p>Brass mounted, with considerable brass and
silver inlay. Good condition. Maker's name illegible,
but "Philadelphia", on lock can be easily
made out. Probably a Tryon.</p>

<p>16. SPRINGFIELD MUSKET. <span class="long">L. 55"</span></p>

<p>Model of 1861, caliber .58, percussion. Marks
on lock, "U. S. Springfield. 1862." Good condition,
with original bayonet. Gift of General F.
D. Beary, The Adjutant General, N. G. P., Harrisburg,
Pa.</p>

<p>17. TWO U. S. SPRINGFIELD ARMY RIFLES. <span class="long">L. 52"</span></p>

<p>Model of 1884. Fitted with ramrod bayonets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
In the best of condition, like new. Gift of Gen'l
F. D. Beary.</p>

<p>17A. Another, which has seen considerable
service. Formerly the property of Jacob Bierly,
a famous early Pennsylvania hunter.</p>

<p>18. KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 55"</span></p>

<p>Stock shortened to half-length and smooth-bored.
The maker of this gun imported his lock
from England, as it is stamped "London, Warranted".
Percussion.</p>

<p>19. U. S. MUSKET, 1822 MODEL. <span class="long">L. 53"</span></p>

<p>Altered to percussion by a rare and rather
crude civilian method, and barrel shortened to
the end of the forestock. Evidently used by
some mountaineer soldier and retained at the
end of his military service as a sporting arm. A
Kentucky type rear sight has been added and
other changes have been made. <i>This gun is not
reliable as a source of information on U. S. military
arms</i>, owing to its numerous alterations.</p>

<p>20. GERMAN-AMERICAN TARGET RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 45"</span></p>

<p>Beautifully checkered stock, octagon barrel.
No ramrod, nor is the gun provided with fittings
for one. In the best of condition. Almost new.
This gun was made for use by a member of some
early German "Scheutzen" rifle club, period of
1855-'75. Mark on lock, "Rein, New York".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>21. DOUBLE OVER-AND-UNDER RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 43"</span></p>

<p>Patch-box gone, and rear sight not original
and badly used. No marks.</p>

<p>22. FRENCH CHASSEPOT ARMY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 51"</span></p>

<p>Marks, "Manufacture Chatellerault. <i>Mle</i>
1866". Almost perfect. May be a Franco-Prussian
War weapon.</p>

<p>23. GERMAN BOAR RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 43"</span></p>

<p>Heavy octagon barrel, sliding wooden cover
box in stock containing worm, sling-swivels, bayonet-stud.
This gun has a most excellent adjustable
rear sight, and is in splendid order.
Caliber, about .70.</p>

<p>24. REMINGTON ARMY RIFLE. <span class="long">L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Rider system action. .50-70. Good.</p>

<p>25. U. S. KRAG RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 49"</span></p>

<p>1898 Model. Five shots, .30-40 Cal. New
condition.</p>

<p>26. REMINGTON CARBINE, CAL., .50-70. <span class="long">L. 37-1/2"</span></p>

<p>27. SHARP'S CIVIL WAR CARBINE. <span class="long">L. 39"</span></p>

<p>Model of 1859. Good. With Lawrence primer
magazine and patch-box in stock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>28. DOUBLE OVER-AND-UNDER RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 49"</span></p>

<p>Good order. Round patch-box. German silver
figure of deer inlaid on cheek-piece. No marks.
Good.</p>

<p>29. PERCUSSION BUFFALO RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 32"</span></p>

<p>Some illegible lettering on barrel, which is octagon
and extremely heavy. Ramrod under barrel.
Stock extends only to breech and is inlaid
with German silver. Extremely rare. This
type was used on the western plains, 1840-'55.</p>

<p>30. U. S. FLINTLOCK MUSKET. <span class="long">L. 58"</span></p>

<p>Model of 1798. Cheek-piece hollowed into
stock. Complete with flint and ramrod and in fine
shooting condition. Mark, "J. Henry, Phila."</p>

<p>31. FLINTLOCK KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 56-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Curley maple stock. Brass mounts, including
long patch-box. Original striped ramrod, which
has been re-tipped with an exploded pistol cartridge.
This gun has been restored, though so
skillfully as to pass for original condition. Fine
shooting order. Mark on lockplate, "Tryon, Philada."</p>

<p>32. U. S. 1822 MODEL ARMY MUSKET. <span class="long">L. 57-1/4"</span></p>

<p>Altered to percussion, apparently by civilian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
gunsmith. Good condition.</p>

<p>33. DOUBLE PERCUSSION SHOTGUN. <span class="long">L. 46-1/2"</span></p>

<p>About 12-bore. Back action locks. No marks.
Has been abused.</p>

<p>34. DOUBLE PERCUSSION SHOTGUN. <span class="long">L. 46"</span></p>

<p>Stock cracked and both locks and one nipple
gone.</p>

<p>35. PERCUSSION KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 55"</span></p>

<p>Inoperative and both sights gone, otherwise
good. No marks.</p>

<p>36. "MULE-EAR" DOUBLE SHOTGUN. <span class="long">L. 49"</span></p>

<p>Superposed barrels. Side action lock. Two
ramrods, both original. Working order. 12-bore.
Very rare. No marks.</p>

<p>37. OVER-AND-UNDER RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 50-1/2"</span></p>

<p>One lock, barrels revolving by hand. Mark
on lock, "Jos. Golgher, Phila." On plate opposite
lock, "I. L. Beck." This rifle was once the property
of Imanuel Beck, a noted Sugar Valley hunter,
and has probably killed much big game. A
rare and historic piece, in the best of condition.
(These double rifles with revolving barrels are
much rarer than the rigid type.) This gun was
not made by Golcher, as he made and furnished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to other makers more locks than he made rifles.
It was his custom to stamp his name on the barrels
of his own guns.</p>

<p>38. WINCHESTER REPEATING RIFLE. 30-in. Barrel.</p>

<p>Model of 1873. .38-40 Cal. Good order.</p>

<p>39. U. S. ARMY MUSKET. <span class="long">L. 55"</span></p>

<p>1808 Model. This specimen has been fitted
with a Civil War type rear sight, evidently having
been issued in 1862, when arms were scarce.
Initials "L. H." cut in stock, while brass plate
is marked "J. E. S." Sling-strap not original
and jaw-screw is obviously home-made, with
square head. Several inches have been cut off
of barrel. This gun is not reliable as a source
of data on U. S. military arms. A curious
mountaineer gun, in fine order.</p>

<p>40. "ZULU" SHOTGUN. <span class="long">L. 50-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Made from old French army rifle. These guns
were sold in great quantities to the poorer farmers
in Pennsylvania. In the stock is a small
piece of wood which was blessed by the French
priests and placed in the stock at the arsenal. It
was supposed to insure accuracy. A curious
outcropping of medieval superstition in modern
times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>41. CIVIL WAR AUSTRIAN PURCHASE CARBINE. <span class="long">L. 30-1/2"</span></p>

<p>"During the first part of the Civil War the
United States purchased a great quantity of
these arms, and before their worthlessness became
apparent a considerable number was issued.
The calibre of most of them was .75; the rifling
was very deep; the recoil and trajectory were abnormal,
and accuracy of shooting was conspicuous
by absence."&mdash;Sawyer, "Our Rifles." Page
235.</p>

<p>42. MOORISH SNAPHAUNCE GUN. <span class="long">L. 62-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Captured from Riff tribesmen early in 1920.
A fine specimen of its type, inlaid with ivory and
showing native repair-work. This is a genuine
snaphaunce, not to be confused with the Spanish
or Moorish Miguelet or outside-lock flintlock.
Rare.</p>

<p>43. SHARP &amp; HANKINS CIVIL WAR CARBINE. <span class="long">L. 39"</span></p>

<p>This is the Navy type, though the leather

<p>53. COOPER FIVE-SHOT REVOLVER. <span class="long">L. 10"</span></p>

<p>Percussion. Double action, .31 Cal. This is
the early Pittsburg revolver, not to be confused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
with arms of the same type made at Philadelphia.
Rare. Resembles the Colt 1849 Model, except
that trigger is in center of trigger-guard.</p>

<p>54. PECULIAR DOUBLE ACTION REVOLVER. <span class="long">L. 5"</span></p>

<p>Percussion. Similar in action to a pepperbox.
Marked "Ell's Patent." The cataloguer has never
before seen a pistol of this type. Good condition.
.31 Cal. Purchased in a Philadelphia
pawn-shop, and said to be a favorite arm of the
Negroes in that city at one time.</p>

<p>55. REID'S "MY FRIEND" KNUCKLE-DUSTER.</p>

<p>Seven shots, .22 Cal. Good order, except that
cylinder does not revolve.</p>

<p>56. ANOTHER.</p>

<p>Similar except for a slight difference of engraving

<p>57. UNDERHAMMER PISTOL. <span class="long">L. 11-1/2"</span></p>

one spring missing. Barrels side by side.</p>

<p>59. TINY .22 PISTOL. <span class="long">L. 4-1/2"</span></p>

<p>One of the lightest pistols the cataloguer has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
ever seen. These ineffectual weapons are sold in
large numbers on the waterfront of Genoa, where
the owner acquired this specimen.</p>

<p>60. HEAVY DOUBLE BARREL PERCUSSION PISTOL. <span class="long">L. 11-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Superposed barrels, two hammers and nipples.
Bronze frame and steel barrels. About
10-bore. Excellent condition. Evidently French,
though it was bought in a Philadelphia pawn-shop.</p>

<p>61. DERRINGER POCKET RIFLE. <span class="long">L. (over all) 28"</span></p>

<p>Shoulder-stock attached. Quite similar in
design to the ordinary pocket Derringer, but has
a long barrel (octagon), a ramrod and ramrod
rib. Peep rear sight. Front sight missing. Very
rare. In good condition.</p>

<p>62. PAIR OF ENGLISH POCKET PISTOLS. <span class="long">L. 6"</span></p>

<p>64. FINE SILVER-MOUNTED TURKISH PISTOL. <span class="long">L. 18"</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Barrel and lock of English manufacture, the
later having a sliding safety and being stamped
"Mortimer", but the rest is Turkish. Stock is of
some dark, hard Oriental wood, probably olive,
and is covered with fine silver-wire inlay. All
mountings are of silver, beautifully sculptured
and engraved and bear curious Turkish hallmarks.
As the ramrods for these pistols were
carried about the neck to facilitate loading on
horseback, they were frequently made without
ramrods attached. This pistol, like the following
one, is furnished with a dummy or imitation
rod. English proof-marks on barrel. Gold
breech-band. In the best of possible condition
and a really beautiful specimen. From the Austin
collection.</p>

<p>65. SILVER-MOUNTED ARABIAN FLINTLOCK PISTOL. <span class="long">L. 16"</span></p>

<p>Mountings entirely of silver. Stock covered
with silver inlay in wire, dot and leaf-and-flower
design. Arabian armorer's marks in gold on barrel.
Fine. From the Austin collection.</p>

<p>Flintlock. Calibre, 11/16 inch. Mark on lock,
"Mauberge". This pistol may have come to this
country with Lafayette's expedition. It has been
neatly though incorrectly restored and is hence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
unreliable as a source of information.</p>

<p>67. COLT PERCUSSION REVOLVER, CAL. .31. <span class="long">L. 10"</span></p>

<p>1849 Model, five shot, bright finish, trigger-guard
and back-strap silvered. Mark, "Address
Samuel Colt, etc." Note the absence of title
"Col." in mark. Rare with this omission. Good
order.</p>

<p>68. U. S. PERCUSSION ARMY PISTOL, Model of 1842. <span class="long">L. 14"</span></p>

<p>Marks on lockplate illegible, but enough can
be deciphered to show that it was made by H.
Aston, of Middleton, Conn. Ramrod not original,
and swivel is missing, but otherwise the pistol is
in good shooting order.</p>

<p>69. UNUSUAL SET OF DEVISME REVOLVERS.</p>

<p>Contained in ebony case, 13" &times; 7", lined with
purple velvet. Fitted compartments, containing
a large six-shot belt revolver of Devisme's invention,
about .45 calibre, a seven-shot .22 calibre
Smith &amp; Wesson pocket revolver and accessories
and ammunition. On the inside of the lid, in
gold letters, "Devisme, 56, Boulevard des Italiens,
Paris." This is a most unusual combination of a
belt and a pocket revolver in the same case. The
little pistol is marked with the name, address and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
patent dates of the Smith &amp; Wesson company
and also with "Claudin, Brevete a Paris, Boulevard
des Italiens, 38". Extremely rare and in
almost new condition.</p>

<p>70. PAIR OF PERCUSSION HOLSTER PISTOLS. <span class="long">L. 13"</span></p>

<p>Silver name-plates and key-plates, beautifully
checkered grips, twist steel barrels and ramrod
ribbs, swivel ramrods. Barrels are extraordinarily
heavy, of about .50 calibre. Smooth bore.
Spur trigger-guards and horn tipped fore-ends.
Mark, on lockplates and barrels, "Champion, Chichester."
These pistols were apparently at one
time cased, for they are accompanied by cleaning
rod with detachable head, nipple-wrench, bullet
mould and combination powder and cap flask.
All in new condition.</p>

<p>71. SINGLE-SHOT BREECH-LOADING PISTOL. <span class="long">L. 13"</span></p>

<p>The only one of the sort that the cataloguer
has ever seen. Probably an inventor's model.
No marks anywhere on it. Stud on the left side
of barrel opens the piece when pushed forward.
About .40 cal.</p>

<p>72. U. S. ARMY LUGER AUTOMATIC. <span class="long">L. 9"</span></p>

<p>Calibre, 7.65 mm. A thousand of these arms
were purchased by the Government in 1901 for
experimental purposes, with the view of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
them standard army equipment. They were
found to be deficient in stopping power, due to
their small calibre, and were for the most part
sold to Bannerman &amp; Co., of New York. Differences
from the ordinary commercial Luger are
as follows:&mdash;one inch longer barrel, grip of black
walnut, U. S. coat of arms stamped on receiver, and
thumb-safety is reversed. Curiously enough, this
particular pistol was purchased from a gunsmith by
W. Fall Gardner, of New York City, while at
Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1920, and while with the
American Army of Occupation. It is interesting
to speculate how the weapon found its way
back to the country of its origin. Rare.</p>

<p>73. BOOTJACK "PISTOL". <span class="long">L. 8"</span></p>

<p>A cast brass folding bootjack, resembling an
old style percussion pocket pistol when closed.
Rare.</p>

<p>Seth Iredell Nelson and his son, Seth Nelson,
Jr., have long been regarded as two of the most
renowned and resourceful big game hunters and
armorers of Central Pennsylvania. At their
home and hunting lodge on the Sinnemahoning
at the foot of Altar Rock, famed in Indian lore,
they maintained a gunshop and forge, making
or repairing many of their own guns, knives, ammunition,
etc., as well as their axes, saws, cant-hooks,
farming implements and the like. Many
of their choicest specimens are now in Dr. Henry
C. Mercer's Museum at Doylestown, Pa. Seth
Iredell Nelson was born in Potter County, Pa.
in 1809, the descendant of a Scotch "kramer"
who went to Germany in the 17th Century with
the ancestor of Col. John Hay, author of "Little
Breeches" and Theodore Roosevelt's great Secretary
of State. Nelson migrated to Clinton County
in 1840, the journey being made in pole-boats
down Kettle Creek and up the West Branch of
the Susquehanna to the mouth of the Sinnemahoning,
and settling in a community still inhabited
by the Seneca Indians. He became known
as the King Hunter of the Sinnemahoning, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
game book showing hundreds of panthers, wolves
and elk and thousands of deer, bears, and wildcats,
and other animals which he captured during
his long career in the Pennsylvania big game
fields. Seth Iredell Nelson died in 1905, and is
buried on top of Karthaus Mountain, overlooking
the one-time hunting paradise where for nearly a
century he was the supreme ruler. Seth Nelson,
Jr. was born in Potter County in 1838 and was
brought to Three Runs, Clinton County, by his
parents two years later. He is today a handsome
old man, with keen blue eyes, regular features,
long hair and snow white beard, hale and
hearty at four score and ten. He accompanied his
father on most of his great hunts and was his
devoted and able assistant in his gunshop and
forge. Even in late years he has turned out guns
complete&mdash;"lock, stock and barrel" and hunting
knives of unusual skill and workmanship.</p>

<p>74. HUNTING KNIFE. <span class="long">L. 10"</span></p>

<p>Staghorn handle. This is of similar design,
as, though of much later date, than the scalping
knives used by such Eighteenth Century frontiersmen
as Covenhoven, the Groves, Van Campen,
Van Gundy and others. Mounted in pewter.</p>

<p>75. SETH NELSON'S SENECA TYPE AXE. <span class="long">L. 13"</span></p>

<p>This type of axe or tomahawk was designed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by John Smoke, one of the last Seneca Indians
residing in Pennsylvania. Initials punched on
blade, "S. N." Double edge. This sort of tomahawk
is now sold commercially under the name of
"Nessmuk Axe".</p>

<p>80. POWDER HORN AND BULLET POUCH.</p>

<p>The 12-inch horn is still fitted with the original
tip-plug and contains a quantity of rifle-powder,
of about FFF texture. These powder-and-bullet
sets are now much rarer than the
rifles with which they were used. A fine old pioneer
piece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>81. SMALL LEAD-HANDLED DAGGER. <span class="long">L. 7-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Given to Col. Shoemaker by Seth Nelson, Jr.,
to illustrate the earliest type of pocket-knife used
by the frontiersmen. Of Indian manufacture and
of the size carried by young girls for general use
and, at a pinch, for protection. Made by John
Smoke for his daughter. The Pennsylvania German
Gipsies called this sort of knife a "schlor".
A similar knife but larger, made by Smoke was
sent by Col. Shoemaker, to Dr. H. C. Mercer,
Doylestown, Pa., 1920.</p>

<p>83. DOUBLE-EDGED FOLDING DAGGER. <span class="long">L. (open) 8-1/2"</span></p>

<p>The Basque national weapon. In appearance,
it resembles an ordinary walking stick with a
plaited leather wrist-thong and grip. Brass-mounted
and tipped with a heavy steel ferrule.
When the handle is unscrewed, there remains a
stout wood shaft, tipped with a sharp steel point.
A really dangerous weapon, in spite of its innocent
appearance, and extremely rare in this
country.</p>

<p>97. DAGGER CANE. <span class="long">L. 36-1/2"</span></p>

<p>Ebony. 11-1/4-inch blade, slightly engraved.

These bayonets were exhibited in this country
during the War as an evidence of German atrocity,
but they were in reality intended for wire-cutting.
Only one was issued to each squad of

rare.</p>

<p>114. BRITISH NAVAL DIRK. XVIII CENT. <span class="long">L. 17"</span></p>

<p>Roughly and cheaply made. Black-painted
poplar stock, brass mountings. Belgian proof-marks.
Guns of this sort were made at a cost
of about a dollar and often brought as much as
five hundred dollars worth of ivory.</p>

<p>2. PERCUSSION KENTUCKY RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 58"</span></p>

<p>Curley maple stock, highly polished and finished
in a dark, mahogany-like red. Big and extremely
ornate brass patch-box, brass plate on
under side of stock, running from trigger-guard
to lower ramrod-thimble, original striped ramrod.
All brasswork engraved. About .32 calibre.
Double set triggers. Sights not original. This rifle
was apparently made to order for some wealthy
gentleman farmer or city sportsman, and it is extremely
accurate. Mark, "Tryon, Philadelphia".
In almost original condition, inside and out.</p>

<p>3. PERCUSSION SPORTING RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 56"</span></p>

<p>Purchased in the neighborhood of Altoona,
Pa., and probably of Pennsylvania origin, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
there are no marks. Similar to the Kentucky
style of rifle, except for back-action lock and
small oval patch-box. Brass mountings and curley
maple stock. About .44 Cal.</p>

<p>4. OVER-AND-UNDER PERCUSSION RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 50"</span></p>

<p>Barrels revolve, being released by catch in
front of trigger-guard. Full length curley maple
stock, ramrod on one side and three German
silver inlays on the other. Large brass patch-box.
Mark; "Conestoga Rifle Works". These double-barrel
rifles with revolving barrels are rare.</p>

<p>Full-length Kentucky type stock. Lock marked
"Jos. Golcher." Weight, 15 pounds. In comparatively
poor order, though it can be fired.</p>

<p>6. U. S. ARTILLERY MUSKET. (PERCUSSION) <span class="long">L. 48"</span></p>

<p>Civil War issue. Used by field artillery for
defending gun-positions against enemy cavalry.
Mark; "Savage R. F. A. Co." A rare type and by
a scarce maker.</p>

<p>7. ENFIELD STYLE CONFEDERATE MUSKET. <span class="long">L. 56"</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Cal., .45-75. Weight, loaded, 11-3/4 lbs. Twelve
shots. Octagon barrel. Stock and forearm
crudely checkered by some former owner. For
some inscrutable reason, the manufacture of this
excellent weapon was discontinued long ago, but
for the sort of hunting to be found in this State,
it is much superior to the later small-bore, high-velocity
arms now sold. Roosevelt carried a rifle
of this model and calibre on his first African expedition
and used it on lions with good effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>11. BALLARD SPORTING RIFLE. <span class="long">L. 46"</span></p>

Weight, 9 lbs., Calibre, .32. This rifle was used
by a resident of Eldorado, Pa., for the purpose of
ending his earthly woes. After the suicide, it was

Market St., Philadelphia." This pistol was made

when direct commerce with England was cut off.</p>

<p>Altered from flint to percussion by rare civilian
alteration. Swivel ramrod. Mark; "A. Waters,

data on U. S. military weapons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
