<P>Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<P>
We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>

<P>Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>

<P>
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<P>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.</p>

<P>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<P>At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.</p>

<P>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<h1>The Lani People</h1>

<P>By: J. F. Bone

<P>CHAPTER I

<P>The boxed ad in the opportunities section of the <I>Kardon
Journal of Allied Medical Sciences</I> stood out like a cut
diamond in a handful of gravel. &quot;Wanted,&quot; it read,
&quot;Veterinarian - for residency in active livestock operation.
Single recent graduate preferred. Quarters and service furnished.
Well-equipped hospital. Five-year contract, renewal option,
starting salary 15,000 cr./annum with periodic increases. State
age, school, marital status, and enclose recent tri-di with
application. Address Box V-9, this journal.&quot;

<P>Jac Kennon read the box a second time. There must be a catch
to it. Nothing that paid a salary that large could possibly be on
the level. Fifteen thousand a year was top pay even on Beta, and
an offer like this for a new graduate was unheard of - unless
Kardon was in the middle of an inflation. But Kardon wasn't. The
planet's financial status was A-1. He knew. He'd checked that
immediately after landing. Whatever might be wrong with Kardon,
it wasn't her currency. The rate of exchange was 1.2-1 Betan.

<P>A five-year contract - hmm - that would the seventy-five
thousand. Figure three thousand a year for living expenses, that
would leave sixty-plenty of capital to start a clinic. The banks
couldn't turn him down if he had that much cash collateral.

<P>Kennon chuckled wryly. He'd better get the job before he
started spending the money he didn't have. He had 231 credits
plus a few halves, tenths, and hundredths, a diploma in
veterinary medicine, some textbooks, a few instruments, and a
first-class spaceman's ticket. By watching his expenses he had
enough money to live here for a month and if nothing came of his
efforts to find a job on this planet, there was always his
spaceman's ticket and another world.

<P>Another world! There were over six thousand planets in the
Brotherhood of Man. At two months per planet, not figuring
transit time, it would take more than a thousand Galactic
Standard years to visit them all, and a man could look forward to
scarcely more than five hundred at best. The habitat of Man had
become too large. There wasn't time to explore every possibility.

<P>But a man could have certain standards, and look until he
found a position that fitted. The trouble was - if the standards
were too high the jobs were too scarce. Despite the chronic
shortage of veterinarians throughout the Brotherhood, there was a
peculiar reluctance on the part of established practitioners to
welcome recent graduates. Most of the ads in the professional
journals read &quot;State salary desired,&quot; which was nothing
more than economic blackmail - a bald-faced attempt to get as
much for as little as possible. Kennon grimaced wryly. He'd be
damned if he'd sell his training for six thousand a year. Slave
labor, that's what it was. There were a dozen ads like that in
the <I>Journal</I>. Well, he'd give them a trial, but he'd ask
eight thousand and full GEA benefits. Eight years of school and
two more as an intern were worth at least that.

<P>He pulled the portable voicewrite to a comfortable position in
front of the view wall and began composing another of the series
of letters that had begun months ago in time and parsecs away in
space. His voice was a fluid counterpoint to the soft hum of the
machine.

<P>And as he dictated, his eyes took in the vista through the
view wall. Albertsville was a nice town, too young for slums, too
new for overpopulation. The white buildings were the color of
winter butter in the warm yellow sunlight as the city drowsed in
the noonday heat. It nestled snugly in the center of a
bowl-shaped valley whose surrounding forest clad hills gave mute
confirmation to the fact that Kardon was still primitive, an
unsettled world that had not yet reached the explosive stage of
population growth that presaged maturity. But that was no
disadvantage. In fact, Kennon liked it. Living could be fun on a
planet like this.

<P>It was abysmally crude compared to Beta, but the Brotherhood
had opened Kardon less than five hundred years ago, and in such a
short time one couldn't expect all the comforts of civilization.

<P>It required a high population density to supply them, and
while Kardon was integrated its population was scarcely more than
two hundred million. It would be some time yet before this world
would achieve a Class I status. However, a Class II planet had
some advantages. What it lacked in conveniences it made up in
opportunities and elbow room.

<P>A normal Betan would have despised this world, but Kennon
wasn't normal, although to the casual eye he was a typical
representative of the Medico-Technological Civilization, long
legged, fair haired, and short bodied with the typical Betan
squint that left his eyes mere slits behind thick lashes and
heavy brows. The difference was internal rather than external.

<P>Possibly it was due to the fact that his father was the
commander of a Shortliner and most of his formative years had
been spent in space. To Kennon, accustomed to the timeless horror
of hyper space, all planets were good, broad open places where a
man could breathe unfiltered air and look for miles across
distances unbroken by dually bulk heads and safety shields. On a
planet there were spaciousness and freedom and after the
claustrophobic confinement of a hyper ship any world was
paradise. Kennon sighed, finished his letters, and placed them in
the mail chute. Perhaps, this time, there would be a favorable
reply.

<P>CHAPTER II

<P>Kennon was startled by the speed with which his letters were
answered. Accustomed to the slower pace of Beta he had expected a
week would elapse before the first reply, but within twenty-four
hours nine of his twelve inquiries were returned. Five expressed
the expected &quot;Thank you but I feel that your asking salary
is a bit high in view of your lack of experience.&quot; Three
were frankly interested and requested a personal interview. And
the last was <I>the</I> letter, outstanding in its quietly
ostentatious folder-the reply from Box V-9.

<P>&quot;Would Dr. Kennon call at 10 A.M. tomorrow at the offices
of Outworld Enterprises Incorporated and bring this letter and
suitable identifications? Kennon chuckled. Would he? There was no
question about it. The address, 200 Central Avenue, was only a
few blocks away. In fact, he could see the building from his
window, a tall functional block of durilium and plastic, soaring
above the others on the street, the sunlight gleaming off its
clean square lines. He eyed it curiously, wondering what he would
find inside.

<P>* * *

<P>The receptionist took his I.D. and the letter, scanned them
briefly, and slipped them into one of the message tubes beside
her desk. &quot;It will only be a moment, Doctor,&quot; she said
impersonally. &quot;Would you care to sit down? '&quot;

<P>Thank you,&quot; he said. The minute, reflected, could easily
be an hour. But she was right. It was only a minute until the
message tube clicked and popped a capsule onto the girl's desk.
She opened it, and removed Kennon's I.D. and a small yellow
plastic rectangle. Her eyes widened at the sight of the plastic
card.

<P>&quot;Here you are, Doctor. Take shaft number one. Slip the
card into the scanner slot and you'll be taken to the correct
floor. The offices you want will be at the end of the corridor to
the left. You'll find any other data you may need on the card in
case you get lost.&quot; She looked at him with a curious mixture
of surprise and respect as she handed him the contents of the
message tube.

<P>Kennon murmured an acknowledgment, took the card and his I.D.,
and entered the grav-shaft. There was the usual moment of
heaviness as the shaft whisked him upward and deposited him in
front of a thickly carpeted corridor.

<P>Executive level, Kennon thought as he followed the
receptionist's directions. No wonder she had looked respectful.
But what was he doing here? The employment of a veterinarian
wasn't important enough to demand the attention of a senior
executive. The personnel section could handle the details of his
application as well as not. He shrugged. Perhaps veterinarians
were more important on Kardon. He didn't know a thing about this
world's customs.

<P>He opened the unmarked door at the end of the corridor,
entered a small reception room, smiled uncertainly at the woman
behind the desk, and received an answering smile in return.

<P>Come right in, Dr. Kennon. Mr. Alexander is waiting for you.

<P>Alexander! The entrepreneur himself! Why? Numb with surprise
Kennon watched the woman open the intercom on her desk.

<P>&quot;Sir, Dr. Kennon is here,&quot; she said.

<P>&quot;Bring him in,&quot; a smooth voice replied from the
speaker. Alexander X. M. Alexander, President of Outsold
Enterprises - a lean, dark, wolfish man in his early sixties -
eyed Kennon with a flat predatory intentness that was oddly
disquieting. His stare combined the analytical inspection of the
pathologist, the probing curiosity of the psychiatrist, and the
weighing appraisal of the butcher. Kennon's thoughts about
Alexander's youth vanished that instant. Those eyes belonged to a
leader on the battlefield of galactic business.

<P>Kennon felt the conditioned respect for authority surge
through him in a smothering wave. Grimly he fought it down,
knowing it was a sign of weakness that would do him no good in
the interview which lay ahead.

<P>&quot;So you're Kennon,&quot; Alexander said. His lingua
franca was clean and accentless. &quot;I expected someone
older.&quot;

<P>&quot;Frankly, sir, so did I,&quot; Kennon replied.

<P>Alexander smiled, an oddly pleasant smile that transformed the
hard straight lines in his face into friendly curves.
&quot;Business, Dr. Kennon, is not the sole property of
age.&quot;

<P>&quot;Nor is a veterinary degree,&quot; Kennon replied.

<P>&quot;True. But one thinks of a Betan as someone ancient and
sedate.&quot;

<P>&quot;Ours is an old planet -- but we still have new
generations.&quot;

<P>&quot;A fact most of us outsiders find hard to believe,&quot;
Alexander said. &quot;I picture your world as an ironclad society
crystallized by age and custom into something rigid and in
flexible.&quot;

<P>&quot;You would be wrong to do so,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;Even though we are cultural introverts there is plenty of
dynamism within our society.&quot;

<P>&quot;How is it that you happen to be out here on the edge of
civilization?&quot;

<P>&quot;I never said I was like my society,&quot; Kennon
grinned. &quot;Actually I suppose I'm one of the proverbial bad
apples.&quot;

<P>&quot;There's more to it than that,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;Your early years probably influenced you.&quot;

<P>Kennon looked sharply at the entrepreneur. How much did the
man really know about him? &quot;I suppose so,&quot; he said
indifferently.&quot;

<P>Alexander looked pleased. &quot;But even with your childhood
experiences there must be an atavistic streak in you - a
throwback to your adventurous Earth forebears who settled your
world?&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. &quot;Perhaps you're right. I really don't
know. Actually, I've never thought about it. It merely seemed to
me that an undeveloped world offered more opportunity.&quot;

<P>&quot;It does,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;But it also offers
more work. If you're figuring that you can get along on the
minimum physical effort required on the Central Worlds, you have
a shock coming.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm not that innocent,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;But I am
not so stupid that I can't apply modifications of Betan
techniques to worlds as new as this.&quot;

<P>Alexander chuckled. &quot;I like you,&quot; he said. suddenly.
&quot;Here read this and see if you'd care to work for me.&quot;
He picked a contract form from one of the piles of paper on his
desk and handed it to Kennon. &quot;This is one of our standard
work contracts. Take it back to your hotel and check it over.
I'll expect to see you at this time tomorrow.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why waste time?&quot; Kennon said. &quot;The
rapid-reading technique originated on Beta. I can tell you in
fifteen minutes.&quot;

<P>&quot;Hmm. Certainly. Read it here if you wish. I like to get
things settled - the sooner the better. Sit down, young man and
read. You can rouse me when you're finished.&quot; He turned his
attention to the papers on his desk and within seconds was
completely oblivious of Kennon, his face set in the rapt
trancelike expression of a trained rapid reader.

<P>Kennon watched for a moment as sheets of paper passed through
Alexander's hands to be added to the pile at the opposite end of
the desk. The man would do better, he thought, if he would have
his staff transcribe the papers to microfilm that could be read
through an interval-timed scanner. He might suggest that later.
As for now, he shrugged and seated himself in the chair beside
the desk. The quiet was broken only by the rustle of paper as the
two rapt-faced men turned page after page with mechanical
regularity.

<P>Finally Kennon turned the last page, paused, blinked, and
performed the necessary mental gymnastics to orient his time
sense. Alexander, he noticed, was still engrossed, sunk in his
autohypnotic trance. Kennon waited until he had finished the
legal folder which he was reading and then gently intruded upon
Alexander's concentration.

<P>Alexander looked up blankly and then went through the same
mental gyrations Kennon had performed a few minutes before. His
eyes focused and became hard and alert.

<P>&quot;Well?&quot; he asked. &quot;What do you think of
it?&quot;

<P>&quot;I think it's the damnedest, trickiest, most unilateral
piece of legalistics I've ever seen,&quot; Kennon said bluntly.
&quot;If that's the best you can offer, I wouldn't touch the job
with a pair of forceps.&quot;

<P>Alexander smiled. &quot;I see you read the fine print,&quot;
he said. There was quiet amusement in his voice. &quot;So you
don't like the contract?&quot;

<P>&quot;No sensible man would. I'm damned if I'll sign
commitment papers just to get a job. No wonder you're having
trouble getting professional help. If your contracts are all like
that it's' a wonder anyone works for you.&quot;

<P>&quot;We have no complaints from our employees,&quot;
Alexander said stiffly.

<P>&quot;How could you? If they signed that contract you'd have a
perfect right to muzzle them.&quot;

<P>&quot;There are other applicants for this post,&quot;
Alexander said.

<P>&quot;Then get one of them. I wouldn't be interested.&quot;

<P>&quot;A spaceman's ticket is a good thing to have,&quot;
Alexander said idly. &quot;It's a useful ace in the hole.
Besides, you have had three other job offers - all of which are
good even though they don't pay fifteen Ems a year.&quot;

<P>Kennon did a quick double take. Alexander's investigative
staff was better than good. It was uncanny.

<P>&quot;But seriously, Dr. Kennon, I am pleased that you do not
like that contract. Frankly, I wouldn't consider employing you if
you did.&quot;

<P>&quot;Sir?&quot;

<P>&quot;That contract is a screen. It weeds out the careless,
the fools, and the unfit in one operation. A man who would sign a
thing like that has no place in my organization.&quot; Alexander
chuckled at Kennon's blank expression. &quot;I see you have had
no experience with screening contracts.&quot;

<P>&quot;I haven't,&quot; Kennon admitted. &quot;On Beta the
tests are formal. The Medico-Psych Division supervises
them.&quot;

<P>&quot;Different worlds, different methods,&quot; Alexander
observed. &quot;But they're all directed toward the same goal.
Here we aren't so civilized. We depend more on personal
judgment.&quot; He took another contract from one of the drawers
of his desk. &quot;Take a look at this. I think you'll be more
satisfied.&quot;

<P>&quot;If you don't mind, I'll read it now,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>Alexander nodded.

<P>* * *

<P>&quot;It's fair enough,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;except for
Article Twelve.&quot;

<P>&quot;The personal privilege section?

<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well, that's the contract. You can take it or leave
it.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll leave it,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Thank you for
your time.&quot; He rose to his feet, smiled at Alexander, and
turned to the door. &quot;Don't bother to call your
receptionist,&quot; he said. &quot;I can find my way out.&quot;

<P>&quot;Just a minute, Doctor,&quot; Alexander said. He was
standing behind the desk, holding out his hand.

<P>&quot;Another test?&quot; Kennon inquired.

<P>Alexander nodded. &quot;The critical one,&quot; he said.
&quot;Do you want the job?&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course.&quot;

<P>&quot;Without knowing more about it?&quot;

<P>&quot;The contract is adequate. It defines my duties.&quot;

<P>&quot;And you think you can handle them?&quot;

<P>&quot;I know I can.&quot;

<P>&quot;I notice,&quot; Alexander observed, &quot;that you
didn't object to other provisions.&quot;

<P>&quot;No, sir. They're pretty rigid, but for the salary you
are paying I figure you should have some rights. Certainly you
have the right to protect your interests. But that Article Twelve
is a direct violation of everything a human being should hold
sacred besides being a violation of the Peeper Laws. I'd never
sign a contract that didn't carry a full Peeper rider.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's quite a bit.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's the minimum,&quot; Kennon corrected.
&quot;Naturally, I won't object to mnemonic erasure of matters
pertaining to your business once my contract's completed and I
leave your employment. But until then there will be no
conditioning, no erasures, no taps, no snoopers, and no checkups
other than the regular periodic psychans. I'll consult with you
on vacation time and will arrange it to suit your convenience.
I'll even agree to emergency recall, but that's the limit.&quot;
Kennon's voice was flat.

<P>&quot;You realize I'm agreeing to give you a great deal of
personal liberty,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;How can I protect
myself?&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll sign a contingency rider,&quot; Kennon said,
&quot;if you will specify precisely what security matters I am
not to reveal.&quot;

<P>&quot;I accept,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;Consider yourself
hired.&quot; He touched a button on his desk. &quot;Prepare a
standard 2-A contract for Dr. Jac Kennon's signature. And attach
two riders, a full P-P-yes, no exceptions - and a security-leak
contingency, Form 287-C. Yes - that's right - that one. And
strike out all provisions of Article Twelve which conflict with
the Peeper Laws. Yes. Now - and finish it as soon as you
can.&quot; He touched another button. &quot;Well, that's
that,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope you'll enjoy being a member of
our group.&quot;

<P>&quot;I think I shall,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;You know, sir,
I would have waived part of that last demand if you had cared to
argue.&quot;

<P>&quot;I know it,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;But what
concessions I could have wrung from you would be relatively
unimportant beside the fact that you would be unhappy about them
later. What little I could have won here, I'd lose elsewhere. And
since I want you, I'd prefer to have you satisfied.&quot;

<P>&quot;I see,&quot; Kennon said. Actually he didn't see at all.
He looked curiously at the entrepreneur. Alexander
<I>couldn't</I> be as easy as he seemed. Objectivity and
dispassionate weighing and balancing were nice traits and very
helpful ones, but in the bear pit of galactic business they
wouldn't keep their owner alive for five minutes. The interworld
trade sharks would have skinned him long ago and divided the
stripped carcass of his company between them.

<P>But Outworld was a &quot;respected&quot; company. The exchange
reports said so - which made Alexander a different breed of cat
entirely. Still, his surface was perfect - polished and
impenetrable as a duralloy turret on one of the latest
Brotherhood battleships. Kennon regretted he wasn't a sensitive.
It would be nice to know what Alexander really was.

<P>&quot;Tell me, sir,&quot; Kennon asked. &quot;What are the
real reasons that make you think I'm the man you want?&quot;

<P>&quot;And you're the young man who's so insistent on a
personal privacy rider,&quot; Alexander chuckled. &quot;However,
there's no harm telling you. There are several reasons.

<P>&quot;You're from a culture whose name is a byword for moral
integrity. That makes you a good risk so far as your ethics are
concerned. In addition you're the product of one of the finest
educational systems in the galaxy-and you have proven your
intelligence to my satisfaction. You also showed me that you
weren't a spineless 'yes man.' And finally, you have a spirit of
adventure. Not one in a million of your people would do what you
have done. What more could an entrepreneur ask of a prospective
employee?&quot;

<P>Kennon sighed and gave up. Alexander wasn't going to reveal a
thing.

<P>&quot;All I hope,&quot; Alexander continued affably, &quot;is
that you'll find Outworld Enterprises as attractive as did your
predecessor Dr. Williamson. He was with us until he died last
month - better than a hundred years.&quot;

<P>&quot;Died rather young, didn't he?&quot;

<P>&quot;Not exactly, he was nearly four hundred when he joined
us. My grandfather was essentially conservative. He liked older
men, and Old Doc was one of his choices - a good one, too. He was
worth every credit we paid him.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll try to do as well,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;but I'd
like to warn you that I have no intention of staying as long as
he did. I want to build a clinic and I figure sixty thousand is
about enough to get started.&quot;

<P>&quot;When will you veterinarians ever learn to be
organization men?&quot; Alexander asked. &quot;You're as
independent as tomcats.&quot;

<P>Kennon grinned. &quot;It's a breed characteristic, I
guess.&quot;

<P>Alexander shrugged. &quot;Perhaps you'll change your mind
after you've worked for us.&quot;

<P>&quot;Possibly, but I doubt it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Tell me that five years from now,&quot; Alexander said -
&quot;Ah - here are the contracts.&quot; He smiled at the trim
secretary who entered the room carrying a stack of papers.

<P>&quot;The riders are as you asked, sir,&quot; the girl said.

<P>&quot;Good. Now, Doctor, if you please.&quot;

<P>&quot;You don't mind if I check them?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Not at all. And when you're through, just leave them on
the desk - except for your copy, of course.&quot; Alexander
scrawled his signature on the bottom of each contract.
&quot;Don't disturb me. I'll be in contact with you. Leave your
whereabouts with your hotel.&quot; He turned to the papers in
front of him, and then looked up for the last time. &quot;Just
one more thing,&quot; he said. &quot;You impress me as a cautious
man. It would be just as well if you carried your caution with
you when you leave this room.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded, and Alexander turned back to his work.

<P>CHAPTER III

<P>&quot;I'd never have guessed yesterday that I'd be here
today,&quot; Kennon said as he looked down at the yellow waters
of the Xantline Sea flashing to the rear of the airboat at a
steady thousand kilometers per hour as they sped westward in the
middle traffic level. The water, some ten thousand meters below,
had been completely empty for hours as the craft hurtled through
the equatorial air.

<P>&quot;We have to move fast to stay ahead of our ulcers,&quot;
Alexander said with a wry smile. &quot;Besides, I wanted to get
away from the Albertsville offices for awhile.&quot;

<P>&quot;Three hours' notice,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;That's
almost too fast.&quot;

<P>&quot;You had nothing to keep you in the city, and neither did
I - at least nothing important. There are plenty of females where
we are going and I need you on Flora - not in Albertsville.
Besides I can get you there faster than if you waited for a
company transport.&quot;

<P>&quot;Judging from those empty sea lanes below, Flora must be
an out-of-the-way place,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;It is. It's out of the trade lanes. Most of the
commercial traffic is in the southern hemisphere. The northern
hemisphere is practically all water. Except for Flora and the
Otpens there isn't a land area for nearly three thousand
kilometers in any direction, and since the company owns Flora and
the surrounding island groups there's no reason for shipping to
come there. We have our own supply vessels, a Discovery Charter,
and a desire for privacy. - Ah! It won't be long now. There's the
Otpens!&quot; Alexander pointed at a smudge on the horizon that
quickly resolved into an irregular chain of tiny islets that
slipped below them. Kennon got a glimpse of gray concrete on one
of the larger islands, a smudge of green trees, and white beaches
against which the yellow waters dashed in smothers of foam.

<P>&quot;Rugged-looking place,&quot; be murmured.

<P>&quot;Most of them are deserted. Two support search and
warning stations and automatic interceptors to protect our
property. Look! - there's Flora.&quot; Alexander gestured at the
land mass that appeared below.

<P>Flora was a great green oval two hundred kilometers long and
about a hundred wide.

<P>&quot;Pretty, isn't it?&quot; Alexander said as they sped over
the low range of hills and the single gaunt volcano filling the
eastward end of the island and swept over a broad green valley
dotted with fields and orchards interspersed at intervals by
red-roofed structures whose purpose was obvious.

<P>&quot;Our farms,&quot; Alexander said redundantly. The airboat
crossed a fair-sized river. &quot;That's the Styx,&quot;
Alexander said. &quot;Grandfather named it. He was a classicist
in his way -  spent a lot of his time reading books most people
never heard of. Things like the <I>Iliad</I> and <I>Gone with the
Wind</I>. The mountains he called the Apennines, and that
volcano's Mount Olympus. The marshland to the north is called the
Pontine Marshes - our main road is the Camino Real.&quot;
Alexander grinned. &quot;There's a lot of Earth on Flora. You'll
find it in every name. Grandfather was an Earthman and he used to
get nostalgic for the homeworld. Well - there's Alexandria coming
up. We've just about reached the end of the line.&quot;

<P>Kennon stared down at the huge gray-green citadel resting on a
small hill in the center of an open plain. It was a Class II
Fortalice built on the efficient star-shaped plan of half a
millennium ago - an ugly spiky pile of durilium, squat and
massive with defensive shields and weapons which could still
withstand hours of assault by the most modern forces.

<P>&quot;Why did he build a thing like that?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Alexandria? - well, we had trouble with the natives when
we first came, and Grandfather had a synthesizer and tapes for a
Fortalice in his ship. So he built it. It serves the dual purpose
of base and house. It's mostly house now, but it's still capable
of being defended.&quot;

<P>&quot;And those outbuildings?&quot;

<P>&quot;They're part of your job.&quot;

<P>The airboat braked sharply and settled with a smooth,
sickeningly swift rush that left Kennon gasping - feeling that
his stomach was still floating above him in the middle level. He
never had become accustomed to an arbutus landing
characteristics.  Spacers were slower and steadier. The ship
landed gently on a pitted concrete slab near the massive
radiation shields of the barricaded entranceway to the fortress.
Projectors in polished dually turrets swivelled to point their
ugly noses at them. It gave Kennon a queasy feeling. He never
liked to trust his future to automatic machinery. If the
analyzers failed to decode the ship's I.D. properly, Kennon,
Alexander, the ship, and a fair slice of surrounding territory
would become an incandescent mass of dissociated atoms.

<P>&quot;Grandfather was a good builder,&quot; Alexander, said
proudly. &quot;Those projectors have been mounted nearly four
hundred years and they're still as good as the day they were
installed.&quot;

<P>&quot;I can see that,&quot; Kennon said uncomfortably.
&quot;You ought to dismantle them. They're enough to give a man
the weebies.&quot;

<P>Alexander chuckled. &quot;Oh - they're safe. The firing
mechanism's safetied. But we keep them in operating condition.
You never can tell when they'll come in handy.&quot;

<P>&quot;I knew Kardon was primitive, but I didn't think it was
that bad. What's the trouble?&quot;

<P>&quot;None - right now,&quot; Alexander said obliquely,
&quot;and since we've shown we can handle ourselves there
probably won't be any more.&quot;

<P>&quot;You must raise some pretty valuable stock if the
competition tried to rustle them in the face of that
armament.&quot;

<P>&quot;We do.&quot; Alexander said. &quot;Now if you'll follow
me&quot; - the entrepreneur opened the cabin door letting in a
blast of heat and a flood of yellow sunlight.

<P>&quot;Great Arthur Fleming!&quot; Kennon exploded. &quot;This
place is a furnace!&quot;

<P>&quot;It's hot out here on the strip,&quot; Alexander
admitted, &quot;but its cool enough inside. Besides, you'll get
used to this quickly enough - and the nights are wonderful. The
evening rains cool things off. Well - come along.&quot; He began
walking toward the arched entrance to the great building some
hundred meters away. Kennon followed looking around curiously. So
this was to be his home for the next five years? It didn't look
particularly inviting. There was a forbidding air about the place
that was in stark contrast to its pleasant surroundings.

<P>They were only a few meters from the archway when a stir of
movement came from its shadow - the first life Kennon had seen
since they descended from the ship. In this furnace heat even the
air was quiet. Two women came out of the darkness, moving with
quiet graceful steps across the blistering hot concrete. They
were naked except for a loincloth, halter, and sandals and so
nearly identical in form and feature that Kennon took them to be
twins. Their skins were burned a deep brown that glistened in the
yellow sun light.

<P>Kennon shrugged. It was none of his business how his employer
ran his household or what his servants wore or didn't wear.
Santos was a planet of nudists, and certainly this hot sun was
fully as brilliant as the one which warmed that tropical planet
In fact, he could see some virtue in wearing as little as
possible. Already he was perspiring.

<P>The two women walked past them toward the airboat. Kennon
turned to look at them and noticed with surprise that they
weren't human. The long tails curled below their spinal bases
were adequate denials of human ancestry.

<P>&quot;Humanoids!&quot; he gasped. &quot;For a moment I
thought-&quot;

<P>&quot;Gave you a start-eh?&quot; Alexander chuckled. &quot;It
always does when a stranger sees a Lani for the first time. Well
- now you've seen some of the livestock what do you think of
them?&quot;

<P>&quot;I think you should have hired a medic.&quot;

<P>Alexander shook his head. &quot;No - it wouldn't be reason
able or legal. You're the man for the job.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I've no experience with humanoid types. We didn't
cover that phase in our studies - and from their appearance
they'd qualify as humans anywhere if it weren't for those
tails!&quot;

<P>&quot;They're far more similar than you think,&quot; Alexander
said. &quot;It just goes to show what parallel evolution can do.
But there are differences.&quot;

<P>&quot;I never knew that there was indigenous humanoid life on
Kardon,&quot; Kennon continued. &quot;The manual says nothing
about it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Naturally. They're indigenous only to this area.&quot;

<P>


<P>&quot;That's impossible. Species as highly organized as that
simply don't originate on isolated islands.&quot;

<P>&quot;This was a subcontinent once,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;Most of it has been inundated. Less than a quarter of a
million years ago there was over a hundred times the land area in
this region than exists today. Then the ocean rose. Now all
that's left is the mid continent plateau and a few mountain tops.
You noted, I suppose, that this is mature topography except for
that range of hills to the east. The whole land area at the time
of flooding was virtually a peneplain. A rise of a few hundred
feet in the ocean level was all that was needed to drown most of
the land.&quot;

<P>&quot;I see. Yes, it's possible that life could have developed
here under those conditions. A peneplain topography argues
permanence for hundreds of millions of years.&quot;

<P>&quot;You have studied geology?&quot; Alexander asked
curiously. &quot;Only as part of my cultural base,&quot; Kennon
said. &quot;Merely a casual acquaintance.&quot;

<P>&quot;We think the Lani were survivors of that catastrophe -
and with their primitive culture they were unable to reach the
other land masses,&quot; Alexander shrugged. &quot;At any rate
they never established themselves anywhere else.&quot;

<P>&quot;How did you happen to come here?&quot;

<P>&quot;I was born here,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;My
grandfather discovered this world better than four hundred years
ago. He picked this area because it all could be comfortably
included in Discovery Rights. It wasn't until years afterward
that he realized the ecological peculiarities of this
region.&quot;

<P>&quot;He certainly capitalized on them.&quot;

<P>&quot;There was plenty of opportunity. The plants and animals
here are different from others in this world. Like Australia in
reverse.&quot;

<P>Kennon looked blank, and Alexander chuckled. &quot;Australia
was a subcontinent on Earth,&quot; he explained. &quot;Its
ecology, however, was exceedingly primitive when compared with
the rest of the planet. Flora's on the contrary, was - and is -
exceedingly advanced when compared with other native life forms
on Kardon.&quot;

<P>&quot;Your grandfather stumbled on a real bonanza,&quot;
Kennon said.

<P>&quot;For which I'm grateful,&quot; Alexander grinned.
&quot;It's made me the biggest operator in this sector of the
galaxy. For practical purposes I own an independent nation.
There's about a thousand humans here, and nearly six thousand
Lani. We're increasing the Lani now, since we found they have
commercial possibilities. Up to thirty years ago we merely used
them for labor.&quot;

<P>Kennon didn't speculate on what Alexander meant. He knew. For
practical purposes, his employer was a slave trader - or would
have been if the natives were human. As it was, the analogy was
so close that it wasn't funny.

<P>They entered the fortress, passed through a decontamination
chamber that would have done credit to an exploration ship, and
emerged dressed in tunics and sandals that were far more
appropriate and comfortable in this tropical climate.

<P>&quot;That's one of Old Doc's ideas,&quot; Alexander said,
gesturing at the door from which they had emerged. &quot;He was a
hound for sanitation and he infected us with the habit.&quot; He
turned and led the way down an arched corridor that opened into a
huge circular room studded with iris doors.

<P>Kennon sucked his breath in with a low gasp of amazement. The
room was a gem of exquisite beauty. The parquet floor was inlaid
with rare hardwoods from a hundred different worlds. Parthian
marble veneer covered with lacy Van tapestries from Santos formed
the walls. Delicate ceramics, sculpture, and bronzes reflected
the art of a score of different civilizations. A circular pool,
festooned with lacelike Halsite ferns, stood in the center of the
room, surrounding a polished black granite pedestal on which
stood an exquisite bronze of four Lani females industriously and
eternally pouring golden water from vases held in their shapely
hands. &quot;Beautiful,&quot; Kennon said softly.

<P>&quot;We like it,&quot; Alexander said.

<P>&quot;We?&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh yes - I forgot to tell you about the Family,&quot;
Alexander said grimly. &quot;I run Outworld, and own fifty per
cent of it. The Family owns the other fifty. There are eight of
them - the finest collection of parasites in the entire galaxy.
At the moment they can't block me since I also control my cousin
Douglas's shares. But when Douglas comes of age they will be
troublesome. Therefore I defer to them. I don't want to build a
united opposition. Usually I can get one or more of them to vote
with me on critical deals, but I always have to pay for their
support.&quot; Alexander's voice was bitter as he touched the
dilate button on the iris door beside him. &quot;You'll have to
meet them tonight. There's five of them here now.&quot;

<P>&quot;That isn't in the contract,&quot; Kennon said. He was
appalled at Alexander. Civilized people didn't speak of others
that way, even to intimates.

<P>&quot;It can't be helped. You must meet them. It's part of the
job.&quot; Alexander's voice was grim. &quot;Mother, Cousin Anne,
Douglas, and Eloise like to play lord of the manor. Cousin Harold
doesn't care - for which you should be grateful.&quot;

<P>The door dilated, and Alexander ushered Kennon into the room.
The Lani sitting on the couch opposite the door leaped to her
feet, her mouth opening in an 0 of surprise. Her soft snow-white
hair, creamy skin, and bright china blue eyes were a startling
contrast to her black loincloth and halter. Kennon stared
appreciatively.

<P>Her effect on Alexander, however, was entirely different. His
face darkened. &quot;You!&quot; he snapped. &quot;What are you
doing here?&quot;

<P>&quot;Serving, sir,&quot; the Lani said.

<P>&quot;On whose authority?&quot;

<P>&quot;Man Douglas, sir.&quot;

<P>Alexander groaned. &quot;You see,&quot; he said, turning to
Kennon. &quot;We need someone here with a little sense. Like I
was telling you, the Family'd&quot; - he stopped abruptly and
turned back to the Lani. &quot;Your name and pedigree,&quot; he
demanded.

<P>&quot;Silver Dawn, sir - out of White Magic - platinum
experimental type - strain four.&quot;

<P>&quot;I thought so. How long have you been inhouse?&quot;

<P>&quot;Almost a month, sir.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're terminated. Report to Goldie and tell her that
Man Alexander wants you sent back to your group.&quot;

<P>The Lani's eyes widened. &quot;Man Alexander! - You?&quot;

<P>Alexander nodded.

<P>&quot;Gosh!&quot; she breathed. &quot;The big boss!&quot;

<P>&quot;Get moving,&quot; Alexander snapped, &quot;and tell
Goldie to report to me in my quarters.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes, sir, right away, sir!&quot; The Lath ran,
disappearing through the door they had entered with a flash of
shapely white limbs.

<P>&quot;That Douglas!&quot; Alexander growled. &quot;Leave that
young fool alone here for six months and he'd disrupt the entire
operation. The nerve of that young pup - requisitioning an
experimental type for household labor. Just what does he think
he's doing?&quot;

<P>The question obviously didn't demand a reply, so Kennon kept
discreetly silent as Alexander crossed the room to the two doors
flanking the couch on which the Lani had sat. He opened the
left-hand one revealing a modern grav-shaft that carried them
swiftly to the uppermost level. They walked down a short corridor
and stopped before another door. It opened into a suite furnished
with stark functional simplicity. It fitted the entrepreneur's
outward personality so exactly that Kennon had no doubt that this
was Alexander's quarters.

<P>&quot;Sit down, Kennon. Relax while you can,&quot; Alexander
said as he dropped into a chair and crossed his sandaled feet.

<P>&quot;I'm sure you have many questions, but they can
wait.&quot;

<P>You might as well get some rest. You'll have little enough
later. The Family will probably put you through the meat grinder,
but remember that they don't control this business. You're my
man.&quot;

<P>Kennon had hardly seated himself in another chair when the
door opened and a plump pink-skinned Lani entered. She was
considerably older than the silver-haired one he had seen
earlier, and her round face was smiling.

<P>&quot;Ah, Goldie,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;I understand Man
Douglas has been giving you quite a time.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's high time you came back, sir,&quot; she said.
&quot;Since Old Doc died, Man Douglas has been impossible. He's
been culling the staff and replacing them with empty-headed
fillies whose only claim to usefulness is that they can fill out
a halter. Pretty soon this place will be a pigsty.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll take care of that,&quot; Alexander promised.
&quot;Now I'd like you to meet Old Doc's replacement. This is Dr.
Kennon, our new veterinarian.&quot;

<P>&quot;Pleased, I'm sure,&quot; Goldie said. &quot;You look
like a nice man.&quot;

<P>&quot;He is,&quot; Alexander said, &quot;but he's just as hard
as Old Doc - and he'll have the same powers. Goldie's the head
housekeeper,&quot; Alexander added. &quot;She's an expert, and
you'd do well to take her advice on assignments.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded.

<P>&quot;Have a maid bring us a light meal and something to
drink,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;Have a couple of porters take
Dr. Kennon's things to Old Doc's house. Find Man Douglas and tell
him I want to see him at once. Tell the Family that I've arrived
and will see them in the Main Lounge at eight tonight. Tell
Blalok I'll be seeing him at nine. That's all.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Goldie said and left the room, her tail
curling buoyantly.

<P>&quot;A good Lani,&quot; Alexander commented. &quot;One of the
best. Loyal, trustworthy, intelligent. She's been running
Alexandria for the past ten years, and should be good for at
least ten more.&quot;

<P>&quot;Ten? - how old is she?&quot;

<P>&quot;Thirty.&quot;

<P>&quot;Thirty - <I>years</I>?&quot;

<P>Alexander nodded.

<P>&quot;Good Lord Lister! I'd have guessed her at least three
hundred!&quot;

<P>&quot;Wrong life scale. Lani only live about one tenth as long
as we do. They're mature at twelve and dead at fifty.&quot;

<P>Alexander sighed. &quot;That's another difference. Even
without agerone we'd live to be a hundred.&quot;

<P>&quot;Have you tried gerontological injections?&quot;

<P>&quot;Once. They produced death in about two days. Killed five
Lani with them.&quot; Alexander's face darkened at an unpleasant
memory. &quot;So we don't try any more,&quot; he said.
&quot;There are too many differences.&quot; He stretched.
&quot;I'd tell you more about them but it'll be better to hear it
from Evald Blalok. He's our superintendent. Steve Jordan can tell
you a lot, too. He runs the Lani Division. But right now let's
wait for Cousin Douglas. The pup will take his time about coming
- but he'll do it in the end. He's afraid not to.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'd rather not,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;It's poor
manners to be injected into a family affair - especially when I'm
just one of the employees.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're <I>not</I> just one of the employees. You are the
Station Veterinarian, and as such you hold an authority second
only to Blalok and myself. You and Blalok are my hands, ears, and
eyes on Flora. You are responsible to me - and to me alone. While
I defer at times to the desires of the Family, I do not have to.
I run Outworld Enterprises and all the extensions of that
organization. I possess control  - and the Family knows it. My
men are respected and furthermore they know everything that goes
on.&quot; He smiled icily. &quot;In a way it's quite a healthy
situation. It keeps my relatives under control. Somehow they
dislike being disciplined before outsiders. Now think no more
about it.&quot; Alexander stood up and walked over to one of the
windows opening onto the broad roof gardens, and stood looking at
the sun-drenched greenery.

<P>&quot;Odd, isn't it,&quot; Alexander said, &quot;how beautiful
nature is and how simple things are in a state of nature. It's
only when man interjects himself onto a scene that things get
complicated. Take Flora for instance. Before Grandfather came
here, it must have been a pleasant place with the simple natives
happy in their paradise. But that's all changed now. We have
taken over - and they, like other lesser creatures on other
worlds, have been bent to our will and uses. I could pity them,
but being human I cannot afford that luxury.&quot;

<P>Kennon understood. He, too, had felt that sensation, that odd
tightening of the throat when he first saw a Varl on Santos. The
Varl had been the dominant life form there until men had come.
Now they were just another animal added to humanity's growing
list of pets and livestock. The little Varl with their
soft-furred bodies and clever six-fingered hands made excellent
pets and precision workmen. The products of those clever hands,
the tiny instruments, the delicate microminiaturized control
circuits, the incredibly fine lacework and tapestries, formed the
bulk of Santos' interstellar trade.

<P>He had owned a Varl once and had delighted in its almost human
intelligence. But the Varl weren't human and there lay their
tragedy. Two thousand years of human domination had left them
completely dependent on their conquerors. They were merely
intelligent animals - and that was all they would ever be until
the human race changed its cultural pattern or was overthrown.
The one alternative was as unlikely as the other. Humanity had
met some fierce competitors, but none with its explosive
acquisitive nature, and none with its drive to conquer, colonize,
and rule. And probably it never would.

<P>The little Varl were one race among hundreds that had fallen
before the fierceness and the greed of men. But unlike most
others, the Varl were not combative. Therefore they had survived.

<P>Yet had it been necessary to reduce them to slavery? They
would never be a threat. Not only were they essentially gentle
and noncombative, but their delicate bodies could not stand the
strains of spaceflight. They were trapped on their world. Why
should they be forced into so subordinate a role? - Why was
humanity so jealous of its dominance that no other species could
exist except by sufferance? Why after five thousand years of
exploration, invasion, and colonization did the human race still
consider the galaxy as its oyster, and themselves uniquely
qualified to hold the knife? He hadn't thought this way since he
had given the Varl to his girl friend of the moment, and had
blasted off for Beta. Now the questions returned to haunt him. As
a Betan, the haunting was even more acute, since Beta had a
related problem that was already troublesome and would become
more acute as the years passed.

<P>He shrugged and laid the thought aside as a slim, dark-haired
Lani entered pushing a service cart ahead of her. The two men ate
silently, each busy with his own thoughts. And behind the view
wall of Alexander's apartment Kardon's brilliant yellow sun sank
slowly toward the horizon, filling the sky with flaming colors of
red and gold, rimmed by the blues and purples of approaching
night. The sunset was gaudy and blatant, Kennon thought with mild
distaste, unlike the restful day-end displays of his homeworld.

<P>CHAPTER IV

<P>Douglas Alexander was a puffy-faced youngster with small
intolerant eyes set in folds of fat above a button nose and a
loose-lipped sensual mouth. There was an odd expression of
defiance overlaid with fear on his pudgy features. Looking at
him, Kennon was reminded of a frightened dog, ready either to
bite or cower.

<P>But it wasn't Douglas who held his eye. It was the two Lani
who followed him into the room. Every line of their bodies was
perfection that spoke volumes about generations of breeding for
physical elegance. They moved with a co-ordinated grace that made
Douglas look even more clumsy by contrast. And they were
identical, twin cream-and-gold works of art. They were completely
nude - and Kennon for the first time in his life fully
appreciated the beauty of an unclad female. To cover them would
be sacrilege, and ornaments would only detract from their
exquisite perfection.

<P>Kennon knew that he was staring like an idiot. Alexander's
amused smile told him that much. With an effort he composed his
startled features.

<P>The pair looked at him with soft violet eyes - and it was as
though some psychic bathhouse attendant had poured ice water down
his spine. For he had seen that look before, that liquid
introspective look in the velvet eyes of cattle. He shivered. For
a moment he had been thinking of them as human. And somehow the
lack of that indefinable some thing called humanity robbed them
of much of their glamour. They were still beautiful, but their
beauty had become impersonal.


<P>&quot;Don't take these as representative of the Lani,&quot;
Alexander said suddenly. &quot;They're a special case, a very
special case.&quot; He glared at his cousin. &quot;Damn your
impudence,&quot; he said without beat. &quot;I sent for you - not
your toys. Send them away.&quot;

<P>Douglas sulkily thrust out his lower lip. &quot;You can't talk
to me like that, Cousin Alex,&quot; he began. &quot;I'm just
a&quot;

<P>&quot;You head me, Douglas. <I>Out!</I>&quot; Alexander's
voice didn't rise but it cut like a whip.

<P>&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;I can't fight
you - yet.&quot; He turned to the humanoids. &quot;You heard the
Boss-man. Go home.&quot;

<P>The two nodded in unison and departed quickly. Somehow Kennon
got the impression that they were happy to leave.

<P>&quot;Just wait,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;You can't boss me
forever. Just wait. I'll reach my majority in five years. I can
vote my shares then - and then I'll fix you. You won't be so high
and mighty then, Mr. Big. I'll throw in with the rest of the
Family. They don't like you too much.&quot;

<P>&quot;Don't hold your breath waiting for the Family to help
you,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;They wouldn't have anyone else
but me handle the finances. They love money too much. And until
you get your inheritance remember one thing - I'm master
here.&quot;

<P>&quot;I know it,&quot; Douglas said, and then curiously -
&quot;Who's the oddball?&quot; He gestured at Kennon with a pudgy
thumb.

<P>&quot;Our new veterinarian, Dr. Kennon.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh - great! Now you tell me!&quot;

<P>&quot;There's nothing like making a good first
impression,&quot; Alexander said with ironic emphasis. &quot;I
hope he cuts you off from the Lani. He'll have the authority to
do it, since he's taking Old Doc's place.&quot;

<P>&quot;He can't. I'm an owner. I own-&quot;

<P>&quot;You own nothing. You're a minor. And under the terms of
Grandfather's will, you'll own nothing except an allowance until
you reach legal age. And that brings me to the reason I brought
you here. Just when did you gain the right to reorganize the
household staff? Just when did you get  the power to interfere
with the experimental program?&quot;

<P>Douglas flushed dull red and bit his lip. &quot;Do we have to
go into this in front of strangers?&quot;

<P>&quot;Kennon's my agent,&quot; Alexander said coldly,
&quot;and he might as well learn about you and the others from
the start.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well - what do you want him to do - watch me
crawl?&quot; Douglas asked bitterly. &quot;You'll make me do it.
You always do. Do you want me to beg, to say I was wrong, to
promise I won't do it again?&quot;

<P>&quot;You've done that already,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;Several times. You need a lesson. I won't have you meddling
with valuable animals.&quot;

<P>&quot;And what are you going to do about it?&quot;

<P>&quot;Put you where you can do no more damage. As of tomorrow
you'll go to Otpen One.&quot;

<P>Douglas paled. His lips quivered, and his eyes flicked
uneasily as he watched Alexander's granite face. &quot;You don't
mean that,&quot; he said finally. &quot;You're joking.&quot;

<P>&quot;I never joke about business.&quot;

<P>&quot;But you can't do that! I'll tell the Family. They won't
let you.&quot;

<P>&quot;I already have their consent,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;I obtained it after your last escapade. You'll be happy out
there. You can play tin god all you like. Master of life and
death on a two-acre island. No one will mind. You can also go to
work. No one will mind that, either. And Mullins won't mind as
long as you leave the troops alone. Now get out of here and get
packed. You're leaving tomorrow morning.&quot;

<P>&quot;But cousin Alex---&quot;

<P>&quot;Move! I'm tired of the sight of you!&quot; Alexander
said.

<P>Douglas turned and shambled out of the room. His ego was
thoroughly deflated and he seemed more frightened than before.
Obviously the Otpens weren't the pleasantest place in this world.

<P>&quot;They're a military post,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;And
Commander Mullins doesn't like Douglas. Can't say that I blame
him. Douglas is a thoroughly unpleasant specimen, and
incidentally quite typical of the rest of the Family.&quot;
Alexander sighed and spread his hands in a gesture that combined
disgust and resignation. &quot;Sometimes I wonder why I have been
cursed with my relatives.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded. The implications behind the empty eyes of
Douglas's Lani sickened him. There were several ways to produce
that expression, all of them unpleasant. Hypnoconditioning, the
Quiet Treatment, brainburning, transorbital leukotomy, lobectomy
- -all of the products of that diseased period of humanity's
thinking when men tampered with the brains of other men in an
effort to cure psychic states. Psychiatry had passed that period,
at least on the civilized worlds, where even animal experiments
were frowned upon as unnecessary cruelty.

<P>&quot;You saw those two Lani,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;Grandfather had them made that way as a birthday present
for Douglas. He was getting senile. He died a year later. You'd
think a man would be ashamed to keep things like that around --
but not Douglas. He <I>likes</I> them.&quot; Alexander's voice
was tinged with contempt. &quot;He knows they disgust me -- so he
parades them in. I could strangle that pup sometimes!&quot;

<P>&quot;I wondered about it. I wouldn't like to work for a man
who permitted such things.&quot;

<P>&quot;That was done before I took over. For the past three
years there have been no dockings, no mutilations. I can't see
treating a helpless animal like that.&quot;

<P>&quot;I feel better about it,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I
didn't think you were that sort.&quot;

<P>&quot;Understand me,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;I'm always
opposed to senseless cruelty and waste -- particularly when it's
dangerous. Docked Lani are the height of stupidity. Just because
someone wants a pet that is an exact duplicate of a human being
is no reason to risk a court action. Those Lani, and a few others
whose tails have been docked, could be a legal bombshell if they
ever left Flora.&quot;

<P>Kennon was jolted. He had been thinking of mental mutilation
and Alexander had been talking physical. Naturally they would be
dangerous property. Anyone attempting to sell a docked Lani would
probably be thrown in Detention and charged with slave trading.

<P>&quot;Did you ever figure the cost of taking a legal action
through our court system?&quot; Alexander asked. &quot;Even the
small ones set you back four or five thousand, and a first-class
action like a Humanity Trial could cost over a million.
Grandfather found that out. Sure, there are differences between
Lani and humans, but a smart lawyer can make them seem trivial
until the final test and that would drag on for nearly two years
until all the requirements were satisfied -- and by that time the
unfavorable publicity would drop sales to zero. The Family would
be on my neck for lost dividends, and I'd lose much of the
control I hold over them.

<P>&quot;Sure, it's possible that prehensile tails could be
produced by mutation, but so far as we know it hasn't happened in
human history. As a result, the tail serves as a trade-mark -
something that can be easily recognized by anyone. So we sell
them intact.&quot; Alexander crossed his legs and settled back in
his chair. &quot;Shocks you, doesn't it?&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded. &quot;Yes,&quot; he admitted. &quot;It
does.&quot;

<P>&quot;I know. You can't help it. Most of our new employees
think the Lani are human - at first. They learn better, but
adjustment is always a strain. They keep confusing external
appearances with the true article. But remember this -- Lani are
not human. They're animals. And on this island they're treated as
what they are -- no more, no less. They are a part of our
economics and are bred, fed, and managed according to sound
livestock principles. Despite some of the things you may see here
in Alexandria, don't forget that. You are a veterinarian. Your
job is to handle disease problems in animals. Lani are animals.
Therefore you will be doing your job. I was disappointed in your
reaction when you first saw them, but I suppose it was natural.
At any rate this should clear the air.&quot;

<P>&quot;It does -- intellectually,&quot; Kennon admitted.
&quot;But the physical resemblance is so close that it is
difficult to accept.&quot;

<P>Alexander smiled. &quot;Don't worry. You'll accept it in time.
Now I think it's time that you met the Family.&quot;

<P>CHAPTER V

<P>The main salon was crowded. The huge room, glittering with
mirrors and crystal, floored with thick carpets, and hung with
rich drapes, had something of the appearance of a Sarkian harem.
Although there were only five of the Alexander family present,
there were at least twenty Lani whose costumes ranged from the
black G string and halter of the household staff to the utter
nudity of Douglas's playthings. They were all female, and Kennon
wondered for a moment what a male was like.

<P>Besides Alexander, there were two men and three women:
Douglas, still with his sulky expression, an older man in his
late nineties who looked like Douglas's eider brother, two mature
women who could be any age from fifty to three hundred, and a
girl. She might have been thirty -- perhaps younger, perhaps
older, a lean feminine edition of Alexander, with the same
intriguing face and veiled predatory look. There was a hardness
about her that was absent in the others. Kennon had the feeling
that whatever this girl did, she didn't do it half way.

<P>&quot;My sister Eloise,&quot; Alexander said in a low voice.
&quot;Watch out for her. She's as deadly as a puff adder and she
collects men. The other man is Douglas's father, Henry. The plump
redhead beside him is his wife, Anne. The other woman is my
mother, Clara, even though Eloise and I don't look like her. We
take after Father.&quot;

<P>&quot;Where's he?&quot; Kennon whispered.

<P>&quot;Dead,&quot; Alexander replied. &quot;He was killed
twenty years ago.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'd like to present Dr. Jac Kennon, our new
veterinarian,&quot; Alexander said into the hush that followed
their entrance. The introductions that followed were in proper
form, and Kennon was beginning to feel more at ease until Eloise
sent one of her Lani with a summons. He looked around for
Alexander, but the entrepreneur was the center of a
three-cornered argument, hemmed in by Douglas, Henry, and Anne.
Henry's voice was raised in bitter protest that Alexander was
exceeding his authority. He shrugged. There was no help there.

<P>&quot;All right,&quot; he said, &quot;tell your mistress I'll
be along in a moment.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes, Doctor,&quot; the Lani said, &quot;but the Woman
Eloise says for you to come, and she is not accustomed to being
disobeyed.&quot;

<P>&quot;Tell her what I said,&quot; Kennon replied. &quot;I
shall be there directly.&quot; He crossed to the table and
examined it, selecting a cluster of odd purple fruit which looked
more interesting than it tasted. When he had finished he walked
leisurely over to where Eloise sat.

<P>She looked at him angrily. &quot;I am accustomed to being
obeyed by my employees,&quot; she said coldly. Her dark eyes,
oddly like her brother's, traversed his hard body like twin
scanners.

<P>He returned her appraising stare with one of his own.
&quot;I'm not your employee,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;I was
hired by your brother, and there's a full peeper rider on my
contract.&quot; His eyes traveled slowly over her carefully
arranged hair, her make-up, her jewelry at throat and arms, her
painted finger-  and toenails, and then across the slim
small-breasted lines of her body half revealed under her thin
ankle-length tunic of Lyranian silk.

<P>&quot;Satisfied?&quot; she asked.

<P>&quot;On Beta,&quot; he said bluntly, &quot;your appearance
would qualify you for a parasite camp. Six months of hard labor
would do you no end of good. You're soft, lazy, and
undisciplined.&quot;

<P>Eloise gasped. &quot;Why, you----&quot;she sputtered.

<P>&quot;And perhaps next time you'll learn to be polite,&quot;
Kennon continued imperturbably. &quot;After all, the superficial
attributes of good breeding are not too hard to
counterfeit.&quot;

<P>To his surprise, Eloise giggled. &quot;You bite, don't
you?&quot; she asked. &quot;Remind me to remember that.&quot;

<P>&quot;I shall.&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course, your actions weren't good breeding
either.&quot;

<P>&quot;Admitted -- but I've never pretended to be what I'm not.
I'm the son of a spaceship skipper, and I'm a veterinarian.
That's all.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's not all. You are also a man.&quot; Her face was
sober, &quot;It's been some time since I've met one. I'd almost
forgotten they existed.&quot;

<P>&quot;There's your brother.&quot;

<P>&quot;Alex? -- he's a money making machine. Come -- sit beside
me and let's talk.&quot;

<P>&quot;About what?&quot;

<P>&quot;You -- me -- your job, your life -- anything you
wish?&quot;

<P>&quot;That line isn't exactly new,&quot; Kennon grinned.

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but it usually
works.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm immune.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's what you think.&quot; Eloise's eyes were frankly
appraising. &quot;I think I could become interested in you.&quot;

<P>&quot;I have a job here. I don't think I would have time to
give you the attention you'd demand.&quot;

<P>&quot;I get bored easily. It probably wouldn't be long before
I would be tired of you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Perhaps -- and perhaps not, I can't afford to take the
chance.&quot;

<P>&quot;You seem confident.&quot;

<P>&quot;You forget. I was a sailor.&quot;

<P>&quot;And spacemen have a reputation, eh?&quot; Eloise
chuckled.

<P>&quot;At that, you might be right. I remember the first
officer of--&quot;she let the thought die. &quot;But I became
tired of him,&quot; she finished.

<P>Kennon smiled. &quot;I've never had that complaint.&quot;

<P>&quot;Perhaps you'd like to make the acid test?&quot; she
asked.

<P>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; he said. &quot;But not tonight.&quot;

<P>&quot;Tomorrow then? Alex will be leaving in the morning. He
never stays more than a few hours.&quot; Eloise's eyes were
bright, her lips moist and red.

<P>&quot;I'll pick the time,&quot; Kennon said -- and added to
himself, &quot;If ever.&quot; Despite her wealth Eloise was no
different from the port-of-call girls. If anything, she was worse
since she had enough money to implement her desires. They were
merely in the trade for business reasons. No -- Eloise would be
something to steer clear of. Alexander was right. She was a
mantrap. He stood up and bowed Betan fashion. &quot;I see your
brother is free now. He wants to brief me on my duties here. We
were discussing it before we entered.&quot;

<P>Eloise pouted. &quot;You can always do that.&quot;

<P>&quot;You said yourself that Alexander never stays here very
long. I would be a poor employee if I delayed him.&quot; He
grinned knowingly at her and she smiled back with complete
understanding.

<P>&quot;Very well, then. Get your business done. Your pleasure
can wait.&quot;

<P>Kennon steered Alexander over to an open window that led to a
balcony. &quot;Whew! he said. &quot;I see what you mean.&quot;

<P>&quot;She's a tartar,&quot; Alexander agreed. &quot;I suspect
that she's a nymphomaniac.&quot;

<P>&quot;You suspect?&quot; Kennon asked. &quot;By this time you
should know. Let's get out of here. I've had about all of your
sister I care to take.&quot;

<P>&quot;Can't say as I blame you. I'll show you to your
quarters. Maybe Old Doc left a bottle or two, although I suspect
the old sinner hung on until the last one was empty.&quot;

<P>&quot;If he had to put up with your relatives as a steady
diet, I can't say that I blame him,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;Careful, Doctor. You're talking about my kinfolk,&quot;
Alexander said wryly. &quot;At that, though, you have a
point.&quot; The two men slipped quietly from the room.
Apparently none of the Family was conscious of their departure
except Eloise, who watched them leave with an enigmatic
expression on her narrow face.

<P>They left the fortress through the rear gate and walked slowly
down the winding path that led to the cluster of buildings in the
valley below. It was a beautiful night, calm and clear with the
stars shining down from the dark vault of the heavens. The
constellations were strange, and Kennon missed the moons. Beta
had three, two of which were always in the sky, but Kardon was
moonless. Somehow it gave the sky an empty look.

<P>A damp coolness rose from the ground as the evening rain
evaporated mistily into the still air. Kennon sniffed the odor of
soil and growing vegetation, clean pleasant odors in contrast to
what he had left. In the distance a bird called sleepily from one
of the fortress turrets and was answered by some creature Kennon
couldn't identify. A murmur of blended sound came from the valley
below, punctuated by high-pitched laughter. Someone was singing,
or perhaps chanting would be a better description. The melody was
strange and the words unrecognizable. The thin whine of an
atomotor in the fortress's generating plant slowly built up to a
keening undertone that blended into the pattern of half-perceived
sound.

<P>&quot;Nice, isn't it?&quot; Alexander remarked as they rounded
another turn on the switchback path.

<P>&quot;Yes. You can't hear a sound from back there except for
that generator. It's almost as though we shut those people out of
existence by merely closing a door.&quot;

<P>&quot;I wish it were that simple,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;But doors that can be closed can also be opened. Well -
think you'll like it here?&quot;

<P>&quot;I think so, providing I don't have to entertain your
relatives.''

<P>&quot;You mean Eloise? Don't worry about her. She's as fickle
as the wind.&quot;

<P>&quot;I've never seen anyone so frankly predatory,&quot;
Kennon said. &quot;She worries me.&quot;

<P>&quot;They'll all be gone tomorrow -- except for Eloise,&quot;
Alexander said with mock comfort. &quot;Douglas is on the Otpens
for a year, and the others are off somewhere.&quot;

<P>&quot;You'll be staying, I suppose.&quot;

<P>&quot;No -- I'm afraid I can't.&quot;

<P>&quot;I hoped you'd help me get organized. This whole thing
has been something of a shock. I was expecting something entirely
different.&quot;

<P>&quot;Sorry -- someone has to run the business. But Blalok'll
brief you. Actually he's more qualified than I. He knows
everything worth knowing about this place. We're going past his
house in a minute--want to stop in and see him?&quot;

<P>&quot;It's pretty late.&quot;

<P>&quot;Not for Blalok. He's a Mystic -- a nocturnal. He's
probably doing his work now.&quot;

<P>&quot;Perhaps we shouldn't disturb him.&quot;

<P>&quot;Nonsense. He's used to it. I visit him frequently at
night.&quot;

<P>&quot;Sure -- but you're the boss.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well -- in a sense you are too. At least in the
veterinary end of this business.&quot; Alexander swung sharply to
the left and climbed a short flight of stairs that led to the
nearest house. Lights flared on the deep porch, and the
old-fashioned  iris door dilated to frame the black silhouette of
a stocky, broad-shouldered man.

<P>&quot;Good evening, sir,&quot; he said. &quot;I was expecting
you. That the new vet with you?&quot;

<P>&quot;Your pipeline's still working, I see,&quot; Alexander
said. &quot;Yes, this is Dr. Kennon -- Evald Blalok -- I wanted
you two to meet.&quot;

<P>Kennon liked the gray middle-aged man. He looked honest and
competent, a solid quiet man with a craggy face and the deep-set
eyes of a Mystic. His skin had the typical thickness and pore
prominence of the dwellers on that foggy world from which he
came. But unlike the natives of Myst, his skin was burned a dark
brown by Kardon's sun. He seemed out of place on this tropic
world, but Kennon reflected wryly that there was probably more
than one misplaced human here, himself included.

<P>&quot;I've been going over Station Fourteen's records with
Jordan,'' Blalok said as he ushered them into the house. A tall
black-haired man rose as they entered.

<P>&quot;Skip the formality, Jordan. Sit down,&quot; Alexander
said, &quot;and meet Dr. Kennon -- Steve Jordan -- Jordan runs
the Lani Division.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded acknowledgment as Alexander continued,
&quot;What's this trouble at Fourteen?&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't know. We've got an epizootic of something.
Another youngster died this morning, and there's three more that
look pretty bad, jaundice, no appetite, complaining of muscular
pains. Same symptoms as took the others. The one this morning
makes the fourth this month, and we're only half through
it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Are all your losses in this one station?&quot; Kennon
asked.

<P>&quot;No -- but it's worst there.&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't like losses like that,&quot; Alexander said.

<P>&quot;Neither do I,&quot; Jordan replied.

<P>&quot;This isn't Jordan's fault, sir,&quot; Blalok said
quickly. &quot;As you know, we haven't had a vet for three
months.&quot;

<P>&quot;Two,&quot; Alexander corrected.

<P>&quot;Three -- Old Doc wasn't around at all the month before
he died,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;As a result we've got a
problem. We need professional help.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well here he is -- use him,&quot; Alexander said. He
looked at Kennon, a trace of amusement on his face. &quot;There's
nothing like getting into things early.&quot;

<P>&quot;Particularly when one comes into them stone cold,&quot;
Kennon added. &quot;It's a poor way to start a career.&quot;

<P>&quot;We can't afford to wait,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;We
need help.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll see what can be done,&quot; Kennon replied.
&quot;Have you saved the body?&quot;

<P>&quot;Every one of them,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;They're in
the hospital in the autopsy room.&quot;

<P>That was sensible. A post-mortem might give us an answer.
Where's the hospital?&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll show you,&quot; Jordan offered.

<P>&quot;Count me out,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;I have a weak
stomach.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll go along if it's necessary,&quot; Blalok said.

<P>&quot;There's a staff there, Old Doc trained them,&quot;
Jordan said.

<P>&quot;Then it shouldn't be necessary,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>Blalok sighed with relief and turned to Alexander. &quot;We
could check the records while those two are about their bloody
work.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'd rather check a long strong drink,&quot; Alexander
replied. &quot;What with the Family and this, it's too much to
take for one evening.&quot;

<P>Kennon hid a smile. Alexander had a weak spot. He was
squeamish. That was a good thing to know.

<P>CHAPTER VI

<P>Jordan opened the door of the two-story building below
Blalok's house. &quot;This is it,&quot; he said, &quot;just
outside your front door. Convenient -- no?&quot;

<P>&quot;Too convenient,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;also too quiet.
Isn't anyone on duty?&quot;

<P>&quot;I wouldn't know. Old Doc never kept the place open at
night.&quot;

<P>There was a stir of movement in the darkness, the lights
flashed on, and a sleepy-eyed Lani blinked at them in the sudden
glare. She looked blankly at Kennon and then brightened as she
saw Jordan. &quot;What's the trouble, sir?&quot; she asked.

<P>&quot;Nothing. We want to look at the Lani I sent down this
morning -- Dr. Kennon would like to inspect the carcass.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're the new doctor?&quot; the Lani asked. &quot;Thank
goodness you've come! I'll get the staff. I'll be back in a
moment.&quot; She stepped quickly over to the switchboard beside
the door and punched five buttons. Four more humanoids came into
the room, followed a little later by a fifth.

<P>&quot;Where's the emergency?&quot; one asked.

<P>&quot;He is -- it's our new doctor.&quot;

<P>&quot;More females,&quot; Kennon muttered to himself. He
turned to Jordan. &quot;Aren't there any males in this
crew?&quot;

<P>Jordan stared at him with mild surprise. &quot;No, sir --
didn't you know? There are no male Lani.&quot;

<P>&quot;<I>What?</I>&quot;

<P>&quot;Just that,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;Only females. There
hasn't been a male on the island since Old Man Alexander took
over. He killed them all.&quot;

<P>&quot;But that's impossible! How do they reproduce?&quot;

<P>&quot;Ever hear of artificial fertilization?&quot;

<P>&quot;Sure -- but that's a dead end. The offspring are
haploids and they're sterile. The line would die out in a
generation.&quot;

<P>&quot;Not the Lani--you can see for yourself. We've been using
the technique here for better than four centuries, and we're
still doing all right. Over forty generations so far, and from
the looks of things we can go on indefinitely.&quot;

<P>&quot;But how is it done?&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't know. That's Alexander's secret. The Boss-man
doesn't tell us everything. All I know is that we get results.
Old Doc knew how it was done, and I suppose you will too, but
don't ask me. I'm dumb.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. Maybe -- maybe not. At any rate there was no
sense in belaboring the point. He turned to the staff. Five of
them were the same big-boned heavy-framed type that apparently
did most of the manual labor. The sixth, the late arrival, was an
elegant creature, a bronze-skinned, green-eyed minx with an elfin
face half hidden under a wavy mass of red-brown hair. Unlike the
others, she had been docked - and in contrast to their heavy eyes
and sleep-puffed features she was alert and lively. She flashed
him an impish grin, revealing clean white teeth.

<P>Kennon smiled back. He couldn't help it. And suddenly the
tension and strangeness was broken. He felt oddly at ease.
&quot;Which of you are on duty?&quot; he asked.

<P>&quot;All of us,&quot; the redhead replied, &quot;if it's
necessary. What do you want us to do?&quot;

<P>&quot;He's already told me. He wants that last carcass prepped
for a post-mortem,&quot; the nightcall Lani said.

<P>&quot;Good,&quot; the redhead said. &quot;It'll be nice to get
to work again.&quot; She turned to face Kennon. &quot;Now, Doctor
-- would you like to see your office? Old Doc left a fine
collection of notes on Lani anatomy and perhaps you could do with
a little review.&quot;

<P>&quot;I could do with a lot of it,&quot; Kennon admitted.
&quot;Unless the inner structure of a Lani is as similar to human
as their outer.&quot;

<P>&quot;There are differences,&quot; the redhead admitted.
&quot;After all, we aren't quite alike.&quot;

<P>&quot;Perhaps I'd better do some reading,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;You need me any more?&quot; Jordan asked.

<P>&quot;No -- I think not.&quot;

<P>&quot;Good. I'll get back. Frankly, I don't like this any
better than Blalok or the boss, but I'm low man on that pole. See
you later.&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled as Jordan left. &quot;Now, let's get ready for
that cadaver,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;Carcass, doctor,&quot; the redhead corrected. &quot;A
cadaver is a dead <I>human</I> body.&quot; She accented the
&quot;human.&quot;

<P>Even in death there is no equality, Kennon thought. He nodded
and the Lani led the way to a door which opened into a good-sized
office, liberally covered with bookshelves. An old-fashioned
plastic desk, some office cybernetics, a battered voicewriter,
and a few chairs completed the furnishings. The redhead placed
several large folio volumes in front of him and stepped back from
the desk as he leafed rapidly through the color plates. It was an
excellent atlas. Dr. Williamson had been a careful and competent
workman.

<P>Half an hour later, well fortified with a positional knowledge
of Lani viscera, Kennon looked up at the redhead. She was still
standing patiently, a statue of red-gold and bronze.

<P>&quot;Get a smock and let's go,&quot; he said. &quot;No --
wait a minute.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes, sir?&quot;

<P>&quot;What's your name? I don't want to say 'Hey you!'&quot;

<P>She smiled. &quot;It's Copper Glow - want my pedigree
too?&quot;

<P>&quot;No -- it wouldn't mean anything to me. Do they call you
Copper or Glow? or both?&quot;

<P>&quot;Just Copper, sir.&quot;

<P>&quot;Very well, Copper - let's get going.&quot;

<P>* * *

<P>The body of the dead Lani lay on the steel table, waxy and
yellowish in the pitiless light of the fluorescents. She had been
hardly more than a child. Kennon felt a twinge of pity - so young
- so young to die. And as he looked he was conscious of another
feeling.

<P>It had been an open secret among his classmates that he had
refused an offer to study human medicine because of his aversion
to dissecting cadavers. The sarcoplastic models were all right,
but when it came to flesh, Kennon didn't have the stomach for it.
And now, the sight of the dead humanoid brought back the same
cold sweat and gut-wrenching nausea that had caused him to turn
to veterinary medicine eight years ago.

<P>He fought the spasms back as he approached the table and made
the external examination. Icterus and a swollen abdomen - the
rest was essentially normal. And he knew with cold certainty that
he could not lay a scalpel edge upon that cold flesh. It was too
human, too like his own.

<P>&quot;Are you ready, Doctor?&quot; the Lani standing across
the table from him asked. &quot;Shall I expose the viscera?&quot;

<P>Kennon's stomach froze. Of course! He should have realized! No
pathologist did his own dissection. He examined. And that he
could do. It was the tactile, not the visual sensations that
upset him. He nodded. &quot;The abdominal viscera first,&quot; he
said.

<P>The Lani laid back the skin and musculature with bold, sure
strokes. An excellent prosectress, Kennon thought. Kennon pointed
at the swollen liver and the Lani deftly severed its attachments
and laid the organ out for inspection. The cause of death was
obvious. The youngster had succumbed to a massive liver-fluke
infestation. It was the worst he had ever seen. The bile ducts
were thick, calcified and choked with literally thousands of the
gray-green leaf-shaped trematodes.

<P>&quot;Let's look at the others,&quot; he said.

<P>Two more post-mortems confirmed the diagnosis. Except for
minor differences, the lesions were identical. He removed a few
of the flukes and set them aside for further study.

<P>&quot;Well that's that,&quot; he said. &quot;You can clean up
now.&quot;

<P>He had found the criminal, and now the problem assumed the
fascinating qualities of a crime hunt. Now he must act to prevent
further murders, to reconstruct the crime, to find the <I>modus
operandi</I>, to track the fluke to its source, and to execute it
before it could do more harm.

<P>Photographs and tri-dis would have to be taken, the parasite
would have to be identified and its sensitivity to therapy
determined. Studies would have to be made on its life cycle, and
the means by which it gained entrance to its host. It wouldn't be
simple, because this trematode was probably <I>Hepatodirus
hominis</I>, and it was tricky. It adapted, like the species it
parasitized.

<P>Kennon leaned back from the microscope and studied the
illustrations in the parasitology text. No matter how much
<I>Hepatodirus</I> changed its life cycle, it could not change
its adult form. The arrangements of the suckers and genital
structures were typical. Old Doc's library on parasites was too
inadequate for more than diagnosis. He would have to wait for his
own books to be uncrated before he could do more than apply
symptomatic treatment. He sighed and rose slowly to his feet.
Tomorrow was going to be a busy day.

<P>The door opened behind Mm and Copper slipped quietly into the
office. She looked at him curiously, a faint half-shy smile on
her face.

<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Are you ready to fill out the autopsy protocol? It's
customary.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's also customary to knock on a door before
entering.&quot;

<P>&quot;Is it? Old Doc never mentioned it.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm not Old Doc.&quot;

<P>&quot;No, you're not,&quot; she admitted. &quot;You're much
younger - and far more beautiful. Old Doc was a fat, gray old
man.&quot; She paused and eyed Kennon appraisingly with a look on
her pointed face that was the virtual twin of Eloise's. &quot;I
think I'll like working for you if you're as nice as you are
pretty.&quot;

<P>&quot;You don't call a <I>man</I> beautiful or pretty!&quot;
Kennon exploded.

<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;

<P>&quot;It just isn't done&quot;

<P>&quot;You're a funny human,&quot; she said. &quot;I called Old
Doc beautiful, and he didn't mind.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's different. He was an old man.&quot;

<P>&quot;What difference does that make?&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't like it,&quot; Kennon said, hitting on the
perfect answer.

<P>She stiffened. &quot;I'm sorry, Doctor. I won't do it
again.&quot; She looked down at him, head cocked sideways.
&quot;I guess I have a lot to learn about you. You're much
different from Old Doc. <I>He</I> didn't snap at me.&quot; She
paused for a moment, then drew a deep breath.

<P>Kennon blinked.

<P>&quot;About that report,&quot; she said. &quot;Regulations
require that each post-mortem be reported promptly and that a
record of the Lani concerned be posted in the death book together
with all pertinent autopsy data. Man Blalok is very fussy about
proper records.&quot; She drew one of the chairs to a spot beside
the desk and sat down, crossed her long legs, and waited
expectantly.

<P>Kennon's mouth was suddenly dry. This situation was
impossible. How in the name of Sir Arthur Fleming could he
dictate a coldly precise report with a naked redhead sitting
beside him? &quot;Look,&quot; he said. &quot;I won't need you. I
can operate a voicewriter. You can pick up the material later and
transcribe it.&quot;

<P>Her face fell. &quot;You don't like me,&quot; she said, her
green eyes filling with quick tears. &quot;Old Doc never---&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh, <I>damn</I> Old Doc!&quot; Kennon snapped. &quot;And
stop that sniveling -- or get out. Better yet -- get out
<I>and</I> stop sniveling!&quot;

<P>She leaped to her feet and fled.

<P>Kennon swore. There was no reason for him to act that way. He
had been more brutal than necessary. But the girl -- no, the Lani
-- was disconcerting. He felt ashamed of himself. He had behaved
like a primitive rather than a member of one of the oldest human
civilizations in the galaxy. He wouldn't bark at a dog that way.
He shook his head. Probably he was tired. Certainly he was
irritable, and unclad females virtually indistinguishable from
human weren't the most soothing objects to contemplate.

<P>He wondered if his exasperation was real or merely a defense
mechanism. First Eloise, and then this! Confound it! He was
surrounded! He felt trapped. And it wasn't because he'd been away
from women too long. A week was hardly that. He grinned as he
recalled the blonde from Thule aboard the starship. Now
<I>there</I> was a woman, even though her ears were pointed and
her arms were too long. She didn't pressure a man. She let him
make the advances.

<P>He grinned. That was it. He was on the defensive. He was the
one who was being pursued -- and his male ego had revolted. He
shrugged and turned his attention to the autopsy report, but it
was hopeless. He couldn't concentrate. He jotted a few notes and
dropped them on the desk -- tomorrow would be time enough. What
he needed now was a stiff drink and eight hours' sleep.

<P>CHAPTER VII

<P>Kennon stopped at Blalok's house long enough to tell the
superintendent what was causing the trouble. Blalok scowled.
&quot;We've never had flukes here before,&quot; he said.
&quot;Why should they appear now?&quot;

<P>&quot;They've been introduced,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;The
thing that bothers me is how Dr. Williamson missed them.&quot;

<P>&quot;The old man was senile,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;He was
nearly blind the last six months of his life. I wouldn't doubt
that he let his assistants do most of his work, and they could
have missed them.&quot;

<P>&quot;Possibly, but the lesions are easy to see. At any rate,
the culprit is known now.&quot;

<P>&quot;Culprit?&quot;

<P>&quot;<I>Hepatodirus hominis</I> -- the human liver fluke.
He's a tricky little fellow -- travels almost as far as men
do.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm glad it's your problem, not mine. All I can remember
about flukes is that they're hard to eradicate.&quot;

<P>&quot;Particularly <I>H. hominis</I>.&quot;

<P>&quot;You can tell me about it later. Right now Mr.
Alexander's over at Old -- your house. Probably he's looking for
you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Where's Jordan?&quot;

<P>&quot;He went up to Station Fourteen. We'll see him
tomorrow.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll say good night then,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;I'm glad you're here. It's a load off my shoulders. See
you tomorrow.&quot; Blalok waved a friendly good night and left
the lights on long enough for Kennon to make his way to his
quarters.

<P>Alexander was seated in a heavily upholstered chair listening
to a taped symphony in the stereo, his eyes half closed, an
expression of peace on his face. An elderly Lani stood beside
him. It was a comfortable picture.

<P>The humanoid saw Kennon and gasped, a tiny indrawn sound of
surprise. Alexander's eyes snapped open. &quot;Oh -- it's
you,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't worry, Kara -- it's your new
doctor.&quot;

<P>Kara smiled. &quot;You startled me,&quot; she said. &quot;I
was dreaming.&quot;

<P>&quot;On your feet?&quot; Alexander interjected idly.

<P>&quot;I should have known you at once, Doctor. There's talk
about you all over the yards, ever since you arrived.&quot;

<P>&quot;They know what is going on around here better than any
of us,&quot; Alexander chuckled. &quot;The grapevine is amazingly
efficient. Well -- what's the story?&quot;

<P>&quot;Liver fluke.&quot;

<P>&quot;Hmm - not good.&quot;

<P>&quot;I think it can be stopped. I looked at the records. It
doesn't seem to have been here too long.&quot;

<P>&quot;I hope you're right. How long will it take?&quot;

<P>&quot;Several months, maybe a year, maybe more. I can't say.
But I'll try to clean it up as quickly as possible. I'm pretty
sure of the fluke, and it's a hard one to control.&quot;

<P>&quot;<I>Hepatodirus?</I>&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded.

<P>&quot;That's an offworld parasite, isn't it?&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes. It originated on Santos. Parasitized the Varl
originally, but liked humans better. It's adapted to a hundred
different planetary environments, and it keeps spreading. It's a
real cutie - almost intelligent the way it behaves. But it can be
licked.&quot;

<P>&quot;Good - get on it right away.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm starting tomorrow.&quot;

<P>&quot;Fine -- I thought you'd be the right man. Kara! Fix the
doctor a drink. We might as well have a nightcap -- then I'll go
back to the house and listen to Henry and Anne's screams about
poor mistreated Douglas, and then back to Albertsville tomorrow.
Duty and the credits call.&quot;

<P>With mild surprise, Kennon realized that Alexander was drunk.
Not obnoxiously, but enough to change his character. Intoxicated,
he was a friendlier person. If there was any truth in the ancient
cliche about alcohol bringing out a man's true character, then
Alexander was basically a very nice person indeed.

<P>&quot;Well -- here's your home for the next five years,&quot;
Alexander said. &quot;Eight rooms, two baths, a freshener, and
three Lani to keep the place running. You've got it made.&quot;

<P>&quot;Perhaps -- we'll see when we tackle this fluke
infestation. Personally, I don't think I'm going to have an easy
time. Tomorrow I'm going to be up to my neck in trouble trying to
save your profits.&quot;

<P>&quot;You'll do it. I have confidence in you.&quot;

<P>&quot;I still think you should have hired a medic.&quot;

<P>&quot;This isn't all of your job,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;And besides I can't afford to do it. Oh - not the money,
but it might be admitting that the Lani might be human. And we've
gone to a great deal of trouble to prove they're not.&quot; He
shifted uncomfortably in his chair. &quot;There's a story behind
this.&quot;

<P>&quot;I wouldn't doubt it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Maybe it'd be better if I told it. It goes back over
four centuries. Grandfather was a clever man. After he had
secured this island he became worried about the surviving Lani.
He didn't want to be accused of genocide, since the Lani were so
human in appearance. So he had his medical officer make a few
autopsies. The M.D. reported that while there was similarity, the
Lani were probably not human.

<P>&quot;That was enough for Grandfather. He requested a Court of
Inquiry. The court was sitting in Halsey and the hearing was
private. Even so, it leaked and Grandfather was highly unpopular
for a time until the lab reports came in. It cost him over eight
hundred Ems and nearly two years' time to finish the case, but
when it was over the Lani were declared alien, and Grandfather
had ironclad discovery rights.

<P>&quot;They really put him through the mill. Grandfather
furnished the bodies and three court-appointed M.O.'s went
through them with microscopes. They didn't miss a thing. Their
reports are so detailed that they're classics of their kind.
They're almost required reading for anyone who wants to learn
Lani structure and function. The court rendered an interim
decision that the Lani were nonhuman, and armed with this,
Grandfather prepared the final tests which were run by a team of
court-appointed medics and biologists, who made <I>in vitro</I>
and live tests on a number of Lani female prisoners. The tests
ran for over two years and were totally negative. So the
Alexander family acquired Flora and the Otpens, and a legal
status.&quot; Alexander stood up. &quot;Well -- that's a capsule
summary. The records are in the library if you'd care to check
them.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;

<P>&quot;Just to prove we're honest.&quot; He moved carefully
toward the door, opened it, and disappeared into the night.

<P>Silently Kennon watched him descend the porch steps. He seemed
steady enough. For a moment Kennon debated whether he should see
him home -- and then decided against it. If Alexander needed help
he'd have asked for it. As it was, it was better to leave things
alone. Certainly he didn't know Alexander well enough to act as a
guardian. He turned back to the living area. The stereo was
playing something soft and nostalgic as Kennon sank into the
chair Alexander had vacated. He let his body relax. It had been
as full a day as he had ever spent filled with changes so abrupt
that they were exhausting. He felt confused. There were no
precedents he could apply. Neither his studies nor his travels
had prepared him for living in a situation like this.

<P>Legally and biologically the Lani weren't human. But they were
intelligent, upright, bipedal mammals whose morphology was so
close to man's that it had taken the ultimate test to settle
their status. And being a Betan, Kennon was suspicious of the
accuracy of that ultimate test.

<P>But the Brotherhood of Man was based upon it. The feeling of
unity that pervaded mankind's expanding empire was its product.
From almost the beginning of mankind's leap to the stars it had
been recognized that men must help each other or perish. The
spirit of co-operation against the common enmity of alien worlds
and cultures transcended the old petty rivalries on Earth. Men --
all men -- were brothers in arms.

<P>And so the Brotherhood was born -- and the concept born of
necessity developed its muscles in a thousand battles on a
thousand hostile worlds. And ultimately it evolved into the only
form of central authority that men would accept. Yet basically it
was not a government. It was an attitude  of mind. Men accepted
its decisions as they would accept the rulings of a family
council, and for the same reasons.

<P>The Brotherhood laid down certain rules but it did not attempt
to enforce them. After all, it didn't need to. It also arbitrated
disputes, admitted new worlds to membership, and organized
concerted human effort against dangerous enemies. And that was
all. Yet in its sphere the authority of the Brotherhood was
absolute.


<P>There was only one criterion for membership in the Brotherhood
-- membership in the human race. No matter how decadent or
primitive a population might be, if it was human it was
automatically eligible for Brotherhood - a free and equal partner
in the society of human worlds.

<P>Kennon doubted that any nonhuman race had ever entered the
select circle of humanity, although individuals might have done
so. A docked Lani, for instance, would probably pass unquestioned
as a human, but the Lani race would not. In consequence they and
their world were fair prey, and had been attacked and subjugated.

<P>Of course, proof of inhumanity was seldom a problem. Most
alien life forms were obviously alien. But there were a few --
like the Lani--where similarities were so close that it was
impossible to determine their status on the basis of morphology
alone. And so the Humanity Test had come into being.

<P>Essentially it was based upon species compatibility -- on the
concept that like can interbreed with like. Tests conducted on
every inhabited world in the Brotherhood had proven this
conclusively. Whatever changes had taken place in the somatic
characteristics of mankind since the Exodus, they had not altered
the compatibility of human germ plasm. Man could interbreed with
man - aliens could not. The test was simple. The results were
observable. And what was more important, everyone could
understand it. No definition of humanity could be more simple or
direct.

<P>But was it accurate?

<P>Like other Betans, Kennon wondered. It was -- so far -
probably. The qualifying phrases were those of the scientist,
that strange breed that refuses to accept anything as an
established fact until it is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.
After all, the human race had been spaceborne for only six
thousand years -- scarcely time for any real differences to
develop. But physical changes had already appeared -- and it
would only be a question of time before these would probably be
followed by genetic changes. And in some groups the changes might
be extensive enough to make them genetic strangers to the rest of
humanity.

<P>What would happen then? No one knew. Actually no one bothered
to think about it except for a few far-seeing men who worried as
they saw.

<P>Probably.

<P>Might.

<P>Possibly.

<P>If.

<P>Four words. But because of them the Betans were slowly
withdrawing from the rest of humanity. Already the radiations of
Beta's variant-G sun had produced changes in the population.
Little things like tougher epidermis and depilation of body hair
-- little things that held alarming implications to Beta's
scientists, and to Beta's people. Not too many generations hence
a Betan outside his home system would be a rarity, and in a few
millennia the Betan system itself would be a closed enclave
peopled by humans who had deviated too far from the basic stock
to mingle with it in safety.

<P>Of course, the Brotherhood itself might be changed by that
time, but there was no assurance that this would happen. And
mankind had a history of dealing harshly with its mutants. So
Beta would play it safe.

<P>Kennon wondered if there were other worlds in the Brotherhood
that had come to the same conclusion. Possibly there were. And
possibly there were worlds where marked deviations had occurred.
There wasn't a year that passed that didn't bring some new human
world into the Brotherhood, and many of these had developed from
that cultural explosion during the First Millennium known as the
Exodus, where small groups of colonists in inadequate ships set
out for unannounced goals to homestead new worlds for man. Some
of these survived, and many were being discovered even at this
late date. But so far none had any difficulty in proving their
human origin.

<P>The Lani, conceivably, could have been descendants of one of
these groups, which probably explained the extreme care the
Brotherhood courts had taken with their case. But they had failed
the test, and were declared animals. Yet it was possible that
they had mutated beyond genetic compatibility. If they had, and
if it were proved, here was a test case that could rock the
galaxy -- that could shake the Brotherhood to its very
foundations -- that could force a re-evaluation of the criteria
of humanity.

<P>Kennon grinned. He was a fine employee. Here he was, less than
a full day on the job, dreaming how he could ruin his employer,
shake the foundation of human civilization, and force ten
thousand billion humans to change their comfortable habit
patterns and their belief in the unchangeable sameness of men. He
was, he reflected wryly, an incurable romantic.

<P>CHAPTER VIII

<P>&quot;Wake up, Doctor, it's six A.M.&quot; A pleasant voice
cut through Kennon's slumber. He opened one eye and looked at the
room. For a moment the strange surroundings bothered him, then
memory took over. He stirred uncomfortably, looking for the owner
of the voice.

<P>&quot;You have your morning calls at seven, and there's a full
day ahead,&quot; the voice went on. &quot;I'm sorry, sir, but you
should get up.&quot; The voice didn't sound particularly sorry.

<P>It was behind him, Kennon decided. He rolled over with a groan
of protest and looked at his tormentor. A gasp of dismay left his
lips, for standing beside the bed, a half smile on her pointed
face, was Copper -- looking fresh and alert and as disturbing as
ever.

<P>It wasn't right, Kennon thought bitterly, to be awakened from
a sound sleep by a naked humanoid who looked too human for
comfort. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he demanded.

<P>&quot;I'm supposed to be here,&quot; Copper said. &quot;I'm
your secretary.'' She grinned and flexed a few curves of her
torso.

<P>Kennon was silent.

<P>&quot;Is there anything wrong?&quot; she asked.

<P>For a moment Kennon was tempted to tell her what was wrong --
but he held his tongue. She probably wouldn't understand. But
there was one thing he'd better settle right now. &quot;Now look
here, young lady--&quot; he began.

<P>&quot;I'm not a lady,&quot; Copper interrupted before he could
continue. &quot;Ladies are human. I'm a Lani.&quot;

<P>&quot;All right,&quot; Kennon growled. &quot;Lani or human,
who cares?

<P>But do you have to break into a man's bedroom and wake him in
the middle of the night?&quot;

<P>&quot;I didn't break in,&quot; she said, &quot;and it isn't
the middle of the night. It's morning.&quot;

<P>&quot;All right -- so it's morning and you didn't break in.
Then how in Halstead's sacred name did you get here?&quot;


<P>&quot;I sleep next door,&quot; she said jerking a thumb in the
direction of an open door in the side wall. &quot;I've been there
ever since you dismissed me last night,&quot; she explained.

<P>The explanation left Kennon cold. The old cliche about doing
as the Santosians do flicked through his mind. Well, perhaps he
would in time -- but not yet. The habits of a lifetime couldn't
be overturned overnight. &quot;Now you have awakened me,&quot; he
said, &quot;perhaps you'll get out of here.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;

<P>&quot;I want to get dressed.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll help you.&quot;

<P>&quot;You will <I>not!</I> I'm perfectly capable of taking
care of myself. I've been dressing myself for years. I'm not used
to people helping me.&quot;

<P>&quot;My -- what a strange world you must come from. Haven't
you ever had a Lani before?&quot;

<P>&quot;No.&quot;

<P>&quot;You poor man.&quot; Her voice was curiously pitying.
&quot;No one to make you feel like the gods. No one to serve you.
No one to even scrub your back.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's enough,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I can scrub my
own back.&quot;

<P>&quot;How? -- you can't reach it.&quot;

<P>Kennon groaned.

<P>&quot;Weren't there any Lani on your world?&quot;

<P>&quot;No.&quot;

<P>&quot;No wonder you left it. It must be quite primitive.&quot;

<P>&quot;Primitive!&quot; Kennon's voice was outraged. &quot;Beta
has one of the highest civilizations in the Brotherhood!&quot;

<P>&quot;But you don't have Lani,&quot; she said patiently.
&quot;So you must be primitive.&quot;

<P>&quot;Halstead, Fleming, and Ochsner!&quot; Kennon swore.
&quot;Do you believe that?&quot;

<P>&quot;Naturally, isn't it obvious? You can't possibly be
civilized unless you take responsibility for intelligent life
other than your own race. Until you face up to your
responsibilities you are merely a member of a dominant race, not
a civilized one.&quot;

<P>Kennon's reply caught in his throat. His eyes widened as he
looked at her, and what he was about to say remained unspoken.
&quot;Out of the mouths of humanoids--&quot; he muttered oddly.

<P>&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Copper asked.

<P>&quot;Forget it,&quot; Kennon said wildly. &quot;Leave me
alone. Go put on some clothes. You embarrass me.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll go,&quot; Copper said, &quot;but you'll have to be
embarrassed. Only household Lani wear cloth.&quot; She frowned,
two vertical furrows dividing her dark brows. &quot;I've never
understood why inhouse Lani have to be disfigured that way, but I
suppose there's some reason for it. Men seldom do anything
without a reason.&quot;

<P>Kennon shook his head. Either she was grossly ignorant, which
he doubted, or she was conditioned to the eyeballs.

<P>The latter was more probable. But even that was doubtful. Her
trenchant remark about civilization wasn't the product of a
conditioned mind. But why was he worrying about her attitudes?
They weren't important -- she wasn't even human. He shook his
head. That was a sophistry. The fact that she wasn't human had
nothing to do with the importance of her attitude. &quot;I
suppose there is a reason,&quot; he agreed. &quot;But I don't
know it. I haven't been here long enough to

<P>know anything about such things.&quot;

<P>She nodded. &quot;That does make a difference,&quot; she
admitted. &quot;Many new men are bothered at first by the fact
that we Lani are naked, but they adjust quickly. So will
you.&quot; She smiled as she turned away. &quot;You see,&quot;
she added over her shoulder as she left the room, &quot;we're not
human. We're just another of your domestic animals.&quot;

<P>Was there laughter in her voice? Kennon wasn't sure. His sigh
was composed of equal parts of relief and exasperation as he
slipped out of bed and began to dress. He'd forgo the shower this
morning. He had no desire for Copper to appear and offer to scrub
his back. In his present state of mind he couldn't take it.
Possibly he'd get used to it in time. Perhaps he might even like
it. But right now he wasn't acclimatized.

<P>* * *

<P>&quot;Man Blalok called,&quot; Copper said as she removed the
breakfast dishes. &quot;He said that he'd be right over to pick
you up. He wants to show you the operation.&quot;&quot;When did
he call?&quot;

<P>&quot;About ten minutes ago. I told him that you were at
breakfast. He said he'd wait.&quot; She disappeared in the
direction of the kitchen.

<P>&quot;There's a nightmare quality to this,&quot; Kennon
muttered as he slipped his arms into the sleeves of his tunic and
closed the seam tabs. &quot;I have the feeling that I'm going to
wake up any minute.&quot; He looked at his reflection in the
dresser mirror, and his reflection looked worriedly back.
&quot;This whole thing has an air of plausible unreality: the
advertisement, the contract, this impossible island that raises
humanoids as part of the livestock.&quot; He shrugged and his
mirrored image shrugged back. &quot;But it's real, all right. No
dream could possibly be this detailed. I wonder how I'm going to
take it for the next five years? Probably not too well,&quot; he
mused silently. &quot;Already I'm talking to myself. Without even
trying, that Lani Copper can make me feel like a Sarkian.&quot;
He nodded at his image.

<P>The Sarkian analogy was almost perfect, he decided. For on
that grimly backward world females were as close to slaves as the
Brotherhood would permit; raised from birth under an iron regimen
designed to produce complaisant mates for the dominant males.
Probably that was the reason Sark was so backward. The men,
having achieved domestic tranquillity, had no desire to do
anything that would disturb the status quo. And since no Sarkian
woman under any conceivable circumstances would annoy her lordly
master with demands to produce better mousetraps, household
gadgetry, and more money, the technological development of Sark
had come to a virtual standstill. It took two sexes to develop a
civilization.

<P>Kennon shrugged. Worlds developed as they did because people
were as they were, and while passing judgment was still a major
human pursuit, no native of one world had a right to force his
customs down the unwilling throat of another. It would be better
to accept his present situation and live with it rather than
trying to impose his Betan conception of morality upon Lani that
neither understood nor appreciated it. His business was to treat
and prevent animal disease. What happened to the animals before
infection or after recovery was none of his affair. That was a
matter between Alexander and his conscience.

<P>Blalok was waiting for him, sitting behind the wheel of a
square boxy vehicle that squatted with an air of unpolished
efficiency on the graveled drive behind his house. He smiled a
quick greeting as Kennon approached. &quot;It's about time you
showed up,&quot; he said. &quot;You'll have to get into the habit
of rising early on this place. We do most of our work early in
the morning and late in the afternoon. During the day it's too
hot to breathe, let alone work. Well, let's get going. There's
still time to visit the outer stations.&quot;

<P>Kennon climbed in and Blalok started the vehicle. &quot;I
thought we'd take a jeep today,&quot; he said. &quot;They aren't
very pretty, but they get around.&quot; He turned onto the
surfaced road that ran down the hill toward the hospital and the
complex of red-roofed buildings clustered about it. &quot;About
those flukes,&quot; he said. &quot;You have any plans to get rid
of them?&quot;

<P>&quot;Not yet. I'll have to look the place over. There's more
detective work than medicine involved in this.&quot;

<P>&quot;Detective work?&quot;

<P>&quot;Sure -- we know the criminal, but to squelch him we have
to learn his hangouts, study his <I>modus operandi</I>, and learn
how to make his victims secure from his activities. Unless we do
that, we can treat individuals from now to infinity and all we'll
have is more cases. We have to apply modern criminology tactics
-- eliminate the source of crime -- stop up the soft spots. In
other words, kill the flukes before they enter the Lani.&quot;

<P>&quot;Old Doc never said anything about this,&quot; Blalok
said.

<P>&quot;Probably he never knew about it. I was looking over the
herd books last night, and I saw nothing about trematodes, or
anything that looked like a parasite pattern until the last few
months.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;

<P>&quot;My guess is that he was one of the first deaths.&quot;

<P>&quot;You mean this thing attacks human beings?&quot;

<P>&quot;Preferentially,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;It's strange,
too, because it originated on Santos so far as we know. In fact,
some people think that the Varl bred it for a weapon to use
against us before we conquered them. They could have done it.
Their biological science was of a high enough order.&quot;

<P>&quot;But how did it get here?&quot;

<P>&quot;I wouldn't know--unless you've hired a Santosian or
someone else who was affected.&quot;

<P>&quot;We did have a man from Santos. Fellow called Joe Kryla.
We had to let him go because he was a nudist. It made a bad
impression on the Lani. But that was over a year ago.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's about the right time to build up a good reservoir
of infection. The fatal cases usually don't show up before an
area is pretty well seeded.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's not so good.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well, there's one thing in our favor. The Lani are
pretty well concentrated into groups. And so far there doesn't
seem to be any infestation outside of Hillside Station - except
for two deaths in Lani recently sent from there. If we quarantine
those stations and work fast, may be we can stop this before it
spreads all over the island&quot;

<P>&quot;That's fine, but what are you going to do now?&quot;

<P>&quot;Treat those that show symptoms. There should be some
Trematox capsules at the hospital. If there aren't we'll get
them. We'll take the sick ones back to the hospital area and push
therapy and supportive treatment. Now that we know the cause, we
shouldn't have any more death losses.&quot;

<P>&quot;Old Doc didn't treat at the hospital,&quot; Blalok said.

<P>&quot;I'm not Old Doc.&quot;

<P>&quot;But it's going to mess up our operations. We're using
the ward buildings to finish training the Lani scheduled for
market.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;

<P>&quot;It's convenient. Most of the ward space is filled right
now.&quot; Blalok said. There was a touch of disgust in his
voice.

<P>&quot;They're well, aren't they?&quot; Kennon demanded.

<P>&quot;Of course.&quot;

<P>&quot;Then get them out of there.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I told you-&quot;

<P>&quot;You told me nothing. The hospital area is needed for
something more than a training center. Perhaps Old Doc was
trained in outcall work, but I'm not. I work from a hospital. The
only things I do on outcalls are diagnoses, vaccinations, and
emergencies. The rest of the patients come to the hospital.&quot;

<P>&quot;This isn't going to set well with Jordan and the
division chiefs.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's not my concern,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I run my
business in the best way possible. The patients are of more
concern than the personal comfort of any straw boss or
administrator. You're the administrator -- you calm them
down.&quot;

<P>&quot;You have the authority,&quot; Blalok admitted. &quot;But
my advice to you is to go slow.&quot;

<P>&quot;I can't,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Not if we want to
prevent any more losses. There simply won't be time to run all
over the island dosing with Trematox and taking temperatures, and
while that sort of thing is routine, it should be supervised.
Besides, you'll see the advantages of this method. Soon
enough.&quot;

<P>&quot;I hope so,&quot; Blalok said as he braked the jeep to a
stop in front of the hospital. &quot;I suppose you'll want to
take some things along.&quot;

<P>&quot;So I will,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I'll be back in a
minute.&quot; Kennon slid from the seat, leaving Blalok looking
peculiarly at his departing back.

<P>The minute stretched to nearly ten before Kennon returned
followed by two Lani carrying bags which they loaded into the
back of the jeep. &quot;I had to reorganize a little,&quot;
Kennon apologized, &quot;some things were unfamiliar.&quot;

<P>&quot;Plan on taking them?&quot; Blalok said, jerking a thumb
at the two Lani.

<P>&quot;Not this time. I'm having them fit up an ambulance. They
should be busy most of the day.&quot;

<P>Blalok grunted and started the turbine. He moved a lever and
the jeep floated off the ground.

<P>&quot;An airboat too,&quot; Kennon remarked. &quot;I wondered
why this rig was so boxy.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's a multipurpose vehicle,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;We
need them around here for fast transport. Most of the roads
aren't so good.&quot; He engaged the drive and the jeep began to
move. &quot;We'll go cross country,&quot; he said.
&quot;Hillside's pretty far out -- the farthest station since we
abandoned Olympus.&quot;

<P>The air began whistling past the boxlike body of the jeep as
Blalok increased the power to the drive and set the machine on
automatic. &quot;We'll get a pretty good cross-section of our
operations on this trip,&quot; he said over the whine of the
turbine. &quot;Look down there.&quot;

<P>They were passing across a series of fenced pastures and
Kennon was impressed. The size of this operation was beginning to
sink in. It hadn't looked so big from the substratosphere in
Alexander's ship, but down here close to the ground it was
enormous. Fields of grain, wide orchards, extensive gardens. Once
they were forced to detour a huge supply boat that rose heavily
in front of them. Working in the fields were dozens of
brown-skinned Lani who paused to look up and wave as the jeep
sped by. Occasional clusters of farm buildings and the low
barrackslike stations appeared and disappeared behind them.

<P>&quot;There's about twenty Lani at each of these
stations,&quot; Blalok said, &quot;They work the farm area under
the direction of the stationmaster.&quot;

<P>&quot;He's a farmer?&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course. Usually he's a graduate of an agricultural
school, hut we have a few who are descendants of the crew of the
first Alexander, and there's one old codger who was actually with
him during the conquest. Most of our stationmasters are family
men. We feel that a wife and children add to a man's stability --
and incidentally keep him from fooling around with the
Lani.&quot;

<P>A series of fenced pastures containing hundreds of huge
grayish-white quadrupeds slipped past.

<P>&quot;Cattle?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Yes - Earth strain. That's why they're so big. We also
have sheep and swine, but you won't see them on this run.&quot;

<P>&quot;Any native animals?&quot;

<P>&quot;A few - and some which are native to other worlds. But
they're luxury-trade items. The big sale items are beef, pork,
and mutton.&quot; Blalok chuckled. &quot;Did you think that the
Lani were our principal export?&quot;


<P>Kennon nodded.

<P>&quot;They're only a drop in the bucket. Agriculture --
Earth-style agriculture -- is our main source of income. The Lani
are valuable principally to keep down the cost of overhead.
Virtually all of them work right here on the island. We don't
sell more than a hundred a year less than five per cent of our
total. And those are surplus -- too light or too delicate for
farm work.&quot;

<P>&quot;Where do you find a market for all this produce?&quot;
Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;There's two hundred million people here, and quite a few
billion more in space-train range. We can produce more cheaply
than any competitor, and we can undersell any competition, even
full automation.&quot; Blalok chuckled. &quot;There are some
things that a computer can't do as well as a human being, and one
of them is farm the foods on which humanity is accustomed to
feed. A man'll pay two credits for a steak. He could get a
<I>Chlorella</I> substitute for half a credit, but he'll still
buy the steak if he can afford it. Same thing goes for fruit,
vegetables, grain, and garden truck. Man's eating habits have
only changed from necessity. Those who can pay will still pay
well for natural foods.&quot; Blalok chuckled. &quot;We've put
quite a dent in the algae and synthetics operations in this
sector.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's still a luxury trade,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;You've eaten synthetic,&quot; Blalok replied. &quot;What
do you prefer?&quot;

<P>Kennon had to agree that Blalok was right. He, too, liked the
real thing far better than its imitations.

<P>&quot;If it's this profitable, then why sell Lani?&quot;
Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;It's the Family's idea. Actually -- since the export
type is surplus it does us no harm. We keep enough for servants
-- and the others would be inefficient for most farm work. So
disposal by sale is a logical and profitable way of culling. But
now the Boss-man is being pressured into breeding an export type.
And this I don't like. It's too commercial. Smells like
slavery.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're a Mystic, aren't you?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Sure -- but that doesn't mean I like slavery. Oh, I know
some of those fatheaded Brotherhood economists call our system
economic slavery -- and I'll admit that it's pretty hard to crack
out of a spherical trust. But that doesn't mean that we have to
stay where we are. Mystics aren't owned by their entrepreneurs.
Sure, it's a tough haul to beat the boss, but it can be done. I
did it, and others do it all the time. The situation isn't
hopeless.&quot;

<P>&quot;But it is with the Lani,&quot; Kennon added.

<P>&quot;Of course. That's why they should be protected. What
chance does a Lani have? Without us they can't even keep going as
a race. They're technological morons. They don't live long enough
to understand modern civilization. To turn those poor helpless
humanoids out into human society would be criminal. It's our duty
to protect them even while we're using them.&quot;

<P>&quot;Man's burden?' Kennon said, repeating the old cliche.

<P>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Blalok scowled. &quot;I wish I had guts
enough to give the Boss-man the facts -- but I can't get nerve
enough to try. I've a good job here -- a wife and two kids -- and
I don't want to jeopardize my future.&quot; Blalok glanced over
the side. &quot;Well, here we are,&quot; he said, and began
descending into the center of a spokelike mass of buildings
radiating outward from a central hub.

<P>&quot;Hmm -- big place,&quot; Kennon murmured.

<P>&quot;It should be,&quot; Blalok replied. &quot;It furnishes
all of our Lani for replacement and export. It can turn out over
a thousand a year at full capacity. Of course we don't run at
that rate, or Flora would be overpopulated. But this is a big
layout, like you said. It can maintain a population of at least
forty thousand. Old Alexander had big ideas.&quot;

<P>&quot;I wonder what he planned to do with them?&quot; Kennon
said.

<P>&quot;I wouldn't know. The Old Man never took anyone into his
confidence.&quot;

<P>Jordan came up as the jeep settled to the ground. &quot;Been
expecting you for the past half hour,&quot; he said. &quot;Your
office said you were on your way. -- Good to see you, too, Doc.
I've been going over the records with Hank Allworth - the
stationmaster here.&quot; Jordan held out his hand.

<P>&quot;You're an Earthman, eh?&quot; Kennon asked as he grasped
the outstretched hand. The gesture was as old as man, its
ritualistic meaning lost in antiquity.

<P>&quot;No -- Marsborn -- a neighbor world,&quot; Jordan said.
&quot;But our customs and Earth's are the same.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're a long way from home,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;No farther than you, Doc.&quot; Jordan looked
uncomfortable. &quot;But we can compare origins later. Right now,
you'd better come into the office. I've run across something
peculiar.&quot;

<P>CHAPTER IX

<P>&quot;There are twelve bays to this station,&quot; Jordan
said. &quot;Under our present setup two are used for breeding and
the other ten for maturation. We rotate the youngsters around the
bay -- a different bay each year until they're age eleven. Then
they're sorted according to type and sent out for a year of
further specialized training after which they go onto the farms,
or to inhouse or export.

<P>&quot;Now here's the peculiar part. There's no trouble in Bays
One through Nine, but Bay Ten has had all our losses except two
that have occurred at the training stations.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's good news,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Our parasite
can't have had time to migrate too far. We have him pinpointed
unless -- say how many training centers are there?&quot;

<P>&quot;Three,&quot; Jordan said.

<P>&quot;Quarantine them,&quot; Kennon replied. &quot;Right now.
Nothing goes in or out until we've checked them and completed
prophylaxis.&quot;

<P>Jordan looked at Blalok inquiringly.

<P>&quot;He's the boss,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;Do as you're
told. This is his problem.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why the quarantine?&quot; Jordan asked.

<P>&quot;I want to get any carriers. We can check them with
antigen, and then give Trematox.&quot;

<P>&quot;All that concentration in Bay Ten,&quot; Jordan said.
&quot;Does it mean something?&quot;

<P>&quot;Blalok said that there was a Santosian in your
division.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yeah - Joe Kryla - and come to think of it, he ran Bay
Ten!&quot;

<P>&quot;That's a help - now let's see what makes that bay
different from the others.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll tell you--but you may not understand,&quot; Kennon
said.

<P>&quot;I'll take a chance.&quot;

<P>Kennon grinned. &quot;All right, you asked for it. The
parasite that's doing the damage is a flatworm, a trematode
called <I>Hepatodirus hominis</I>. As I've told Blalok, it's a
tricky thing. Like all trematodes it has a three-stage life
cycle, but unlike every other fluke, its life cycle is not fixed
to definite intermediate hosts. Depending upon where it is, the
fluke adapts. It still must pass through its life cycle, but its
intermediate host need not be one species of snail, fish, or
copepod. Any cold-blooded host will do. What you have here is a
Kardonian variant which has adapted to some particular
intermediate host on this world. Until now, its final host was
either man or Varl. Now we have a third, the Lani. And apparently
they are the most susceptible of the three. It never kills Varl.
And humans, while they're more susceptible, only occasionally
succumb, but the Lani appear to be the most susceptible of all.
I've never seen an infestation like those Lani had. Their livers
were literally crawling with flukes.&quot; Kennon paused and
looked at Jordan. &quot;You following me?&quot; he asked.

<P>&quot;Slowly and poorly,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;You're
assuming too much knowledge on my part.&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled. &quot;You can't say I didn't warn you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well -- I'm really interested in only one thing - how do
you break the parasite up in business?&quot;

<P>&quot;There's only one sure way -- and that's to break the
life cycle. The technique is thousands of years old, but it's
just as good today as it was then.&quot;

<P>&quot;Good -- then let's do it.&quot;

<P>&quot;To make a varrit stew,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;one must
first catch the varrit.&quot;

<P>&quot;Huh?&quot;

<P>&quot;We have to learn the beastie's life cycle before we can
break it, and like I said, it adapts. Its intermediate host can
be any one of a hundred cold-blooded animals.&quot;

<P>&quot;Is there no place else where it can be attacked?&quot;

<P>&quot;Sure, in the body of the final host, or on its final
encysting place. But that won't eliminate the bug.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;

<P>&quot;It'll still survive in its infective form and enough
Lani will get subacute dosage to propagate it until the time is
right for another epizootic. We have to kill its intermediate
host -- or hosts if it has more than one. That will keep it from
growing and will ultimately eradicate it.&quot;

<P>Judson scratched his head. &quot;It sounds complicated,&quot;

<P>&quot;It is. It's so complicated that once the fluke becomes
well established it's virtually impossible to eradicate.&quot;

<P>&quot;And you think it can be done here?&quot;

<P>&quot;We can give it the old college try. But it's going to
take some detective work.&quot;

<P>&quot;Where do we start?&quot;

<P>&quot;With Bay Ten. We look it over real well. Then we check
the diet and habits of the Lani. Then we check each individual
Lani. Then we check the life cycle of the parasite. Somewhere
along the line if we're lucky we'll find a weak point that can be
attacked.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's a big order,&quot; Blalok said.

<P>&quot;It can't be helped. That's the way it is. Of course,
we're lucky that we're on an isolated land mass. That gives us an
advantage. We should be able to clean this up.&quot;

<P>&quot;How long do you think it will take?&quot;

<P>&quot;It depends on how well the fluke is established. Six
months at the minimum -- and I wouldn't care to guess at the
maximum. However, I hope the minimum will be time enough.&quot;

<P>&quot;So do I,&quot; Blalok said.

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;let's get on with
it.&quot;

<P>&quot;I hope it won't interrupt our program,&quot; Jordan
said.

<P>&quot;Of course it will interrupt it,&quot; Kennon replied.
&quot;It can't help it. Get the idea in your head that you're
facing something here that can cripple you -- maybe abort your
whole operation. You have a choice -- interrupt now or abort
later. And half measures won't work. To eradicate this pest
requires an all-out effort.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I can't see why we can't merely bypass Bay
Ten--&quot; Jordan said.

<P>&quot;Take my word for it,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;You can't.
There's no accurate way of telling how far this spreads until the
death losses occur. Our tests for fluke infestation aren't that
good. We have to work thoroughly and carefully. We can't be
butting heads over this -- either we all co-operate or this whole
operation will blow up in our faces.

<P>&quot;Look at the record. Six months ago you ended a year with
no deaths from disease. Five months ago Old Doc and two Lani were
ill. Four months ago one of the two Lani was dead and Old Doc was
too ill to be effective. Three months ago Old Doc and the other
Lani were dead, and before the end of the month two more followed
them. Two months ago six died, last month eight, and so far this
month you've lost four and you have over two weeks to go. Up to
now they've all been from here, but two this month were at other
stations. In six months if nothing is done, we'll be having
losses there unless we're lucky. And the losses will keep on
increasing. Apparently you don't know what it is to live with
parasites - so let me tell you. It isn't pleasant!&quot;

<P>Blalok shrugged. &quot;You needn't get hot about it,&quot; he
said. &quot;After all, you're the Doc -- and we'll
co-operate.&quot;

<P>Jordan nodded. &quot;We will,&quot; he said. &quot;All the
way.&quot;

<P>CHAPTER X

<P>There is a special providence that looks over recent
veterinary graduates, Kennon reflected as he checked the monthly
reports from the Stations. Since the time he had laid down the
law to Judson and Blalok, he had had no trouble from the
production staff. And for the past four months there had been no
further trouble with <I>Hepatodirus</I>. That unwanted visitor
had apparently been evicted. At that, they had been lucky. The
parasite had been concentrated at Hillside Station and had failed
to establish itself in the training area. The intermediate host,
it had turned out, was a small amphibian that was susceptible to
commercial insecticide. It had been no trouble to eradicate.
Systemic treatment and cooking of all food had cleaned up the
infective cercaria and individual infections, and after six
months of intensive search, quarantine, and investigation, Kennon
was morally certain that the disease had been eradicated. The
last four reports confirmed his belief.

<P>He sighed as he leaned back in his chair. Blalok was at last
convinced that his ideas were right. The hospital was operating
as a hospital should, with a staff of twelve Lani kept busy
checking the full wards. Actually, it was working better than it
should, since stationmasters all over the island were now
shipping in sick animals rather than treating them or requesting
outpatient service.

<P>&quot;Hi, Doc,&quot; Blalok said as he pushed the door open
and looked into the office. &quot;You doing anything?&quot;

<P>&quot;Not at the moment,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Something
troubling you?&quot;

<P>&quot;No -- just thought I'd drop in for a moment and
congratulate you.&quot;

<P>&quot;For what?&quot;

<P>&quot;For surviving the first year.&quot;

<P>&quot;That won't be for two months yet.&quot;

<P>Blalok shook his head. &quot;This is Kardon,&quot; he said.
&quot;There's only three hundred and two days in our year, ten
thirty-day months and two special days at the year's end.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. &quot;My contract is Galactic Standard. I
still have two months to go. But how come the ten-month year?
Most other planets have twelve, regardless of the number of
days.&quot;

<P>&quot;Old Alexander liked thirty-day months.&quot;

<P>&quot;I've wondered about that.&quot;

<P>&quot;You'll find a lot more peculiar things about Flora when
you get to know her better. This year has just been a breaking-in
period.&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled. &quot;It's damn near broken me,&quot; he
admitted. &quot;You know, I thought that the Lani'd be my
principal practice when I came here.&quot;

<P>&quot;You didn't figure that right. They're the easiest part.
They're intelligent and co-operative.&quot;

<P>&quot;Which is more than one can say about the others.&quot;
Kennon wiped the sweat from his face. &quot;What with this
infernal heat and their eternal stubbornness, I've nearly been
driven crazy.&quot;

<P>&quot;You shouldn't have laid out that vaccination
program.&quot;

<P>&quot;I had to. Your hog business was living mostly on luck,
and the sheep and shrakes were almost as bad. You can't get away
from soil saprophytes no matter how clean you are. Under a
pasture setup there's always a chance of contamination. And that
old cliche about an ounce of prevention is truer of livestock
raising than anything else I can think of.&quot;

<P>&quot;I have some more good news for you,&quot; Blalok said.
&quot;That's why I came over. We're going to have another species
to treat and vaccinate.&quot;

<P>Kennon groaned. &quot;Now what?&quot;

<P>&quot;Poultry.&quot; Blalok's voice was disgusted.
&quot;Personally I think it's a mess, but Alexander thinks it's
profitable. Someone's told him that pound for pound chickens are
the most efficient feed converters of all the domestic animals.
So we're getting a pilot plant: eggs, incubator, and a
knocked-down broiler battery so we can try the idea out. The
Boss-man is always hot on new ideas to increase efficiency and
production. The only trouble is that he fails to consider the
work involved in setting up another operation.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're so right. I'll have to brush up on pullorum,
ornithosis, coccidosis, leukosis, perosis, and Ochsner knows how
many other -osises and -itises. I was never too strong on fowl
practice in school, and I'd be happier if I never had anything to
do with them.&quot;

<P>&quot;So would I,&quot; Blalok agreed. &quot;I can't see
anything in this but trouble.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded.

<P>&quot;And he's forgotten something else,&quot; Blalok added.
&quot;Poultry need concentrated feed. We're going to have to
install a feed mill.&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled. &quot;I hope he'll appreciate the bill he
gets.&quot;

<P>&quot;He thinks we can use local labor,&quot; Blalok said
gloomily. &quot;I wish he'd realize that Lani are technological
morons.&quot;

<P>&quot;They could learn.&quot;

<P>&quot;I suppose so -- but it isn't easy. And besides, Allworth
is the only man with feed-mill experience, and he's up to his
ears with Hillside Station since that expansion order came
in.&quot;

<P>&quot;I never did get the reason for that. After we complained
about the slavery implications and got the Boss-man's okay to
hold the line, why do we need more Lani?&quot;

<P>&quot;Didn't you know? His sister's finally decided to try
marriage. Found herself some overmuscled Halsite who looked good
to her -- but she couldn't crack his moral barrier.&quot; Blalok
grinned. &quot;I thought you'd be the first to know. Wasn't she
interested in you?&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled. &quot;You could call it that. Interested --
like the way a dog's interested in a beefsteak. It's a good thing
we had that fluke problem or I'd have been chewed up and digested
long ago. That woman frightens me.&quot;

<P>&quot;I could be scared by uglier things,&quot; Blalok said.
&quot;With the Boss-man's sister on my side I wouldn't
worry.&quot;

<P>&quot;What makes you think she'd be on my side? She's a
cannibal.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well, you know her better than I do.&quot;

<P>He did -- he certainly did. That first month had been one of
the worst he had ever spent, Kennon reflected. Between Eloise and
the flukes, he had nearly collapsed -- and when it had come to
the final showdown, he thought for a while that he'd be looking
for another job. But Alexander had been more than passably
understanding and had refused his sister's passionate pleas for a
Betan scalp. He owed a debt of gratitude to the Boss-man.

<P>&quot;You're lucky you never knew her,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;That all depends on what you mean,&quot; Blalok said as
he grinned and walked to the door. The parting shot missed its
mark entirely as Kennon looked at him with blank incomprehension.
&quot;You should have been a Mystic,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;A
knowledge of the sacred books would do you no end of good.&quot;
And with that cryptic remark the superintendent vanished.

<P>&quot;That had all the elements of a snide remark,&quot;
Kennon murmured to himself, &quot;but my education's been
neglected somewhere along the line. I don't get it.&quot; He
shrugged and buzzed for Copper. The veterinary report would have
to be added to the pile already before him, and the Boss-man
liked to have his reports on time.

<P>Copper watched Kennon as he dictated the covering letter, her
slim fingers dancing over the stenotype. He had been here a full
year -- but instead of becoming a familiar object, he had grown
so gigantic that he filled her world. And it wasn't merely
because he was young and beautiful. He was kind, too.

<P>Yet she couldn't approach him, and she wanted to so
desperately that it was a physical pain. Other Lani had told her
about men and what they could do. Even her old preceptress at
Hillside Station had given her some advice when Man Allworth had
tattooed the tiny V on her thigh that meant she had been selected
for the veterinary staff. And when Old Doc had brought her from
the Training Station to the hospital and removed her tail, she
was certain that she was one of the lucky ones who would know
love.

<P>But love wasn't a pain in the chest, an ache in the belly and
thighs, an unfulfilled longing that destroyed sleep and made food
tasteless. Love was supposed to be pleasant and exciting. She
could remember every word her preceptress had spoken.

<P>&quot;My little one,&quot; the old Lani had said, &quot;you
now wear the doctor's mark. And soon no one will be able to tell
you from a human. You will look like our masters. You will share
in their work. And there may be times when you will find favor in
their eyes. Then you may learn of love.

<P>&quot;Love,&quot; the old voice was soft in Copper's ears.
&quot;The word is almost a stranger to us now, known only to the
few who serve our masters. It was not always so. The Old Ones
knew love before Man Alexander came. And our young were the fruit
of love rather than the product of our masters' cunning. But you
may know the flower even though you cannot bear its fruit. You
may enter that world of pleasure-pain the Old Ones knew, that
world which is now denied us.

<P>&quot;But remember always that you are a Lani. A man may be
kind to you. He may treat you gently. He may show you love. Yet
you never will be his equal. Nor must you become too attached to
him, for you are not human. You are not his natural mate. You
cannot bear his young. You cannot completely share. You can only
accept.

<P>&quot;So if love should come to you, take it and enjoy it, but
do not try to possess it. For there lies heartache rather than
happiness. And it is a world of heartache, my little one, to long
for something which you cannot have.&quot;

<P><I>To long for something which one cannot have!</I> Copper
knew that feeling. It had been with her ever since Kennon had
come into her life that night a year ago. And it had grown until
it had become gigantic. He was kind -- yes. He was harsh --
occasionally. Yet he had shown her no more affection than he
would have shown a dog. Less -- for he would have petted a dog
and he did not touch her.

<P>He laughed, but she was not a part of his laughter. He needed
her, but the need was that of a builder for a tool. He liked her
and sometimes shared his problems and triumphs with her, and
sometimes his defeats, but he did not love. There had never been
for her the bright fierce look he had bent upon the Woman Eloise
those times when she had come to him, the look men gave to those
who found favor in their eyes.

<P>Had he looked at her but once with that expression she would
have come to him though fire barred the way. The Woman Eloise was
a fool.

<P>Copper looked at him across the corner of the desk, the yellow
hair, the bronze skin, firm chin, soft lips and long straight
nose, the narrowed eyes, hooded beneath thick brows, scanning the
papers in his lean-tendoned hands. His nearness was an ache in
her body -- yet he was far away.

<P>She thought of how his hands would feel upon her. He had
touched her once, and that touch had burned like hot iron. For
hours she had felt it. He looked up. Her heart choked her with
its beating. She would die for him if he would but once run his
fingers over her tingling skin, and stroke her hair.

<P>The naked emotion in Copper's face was readable enough, Kennon
thought. One didn't need Sorovkin techniques to interpret what
was in her mind. And it would have been amusing if it weren't so
sad. For what she wanted, he couldn't give. Yet if she were human
it would be easy. A hundred generations of Betan moral code said
&quot;never,&quot; yet when he looked at her their voices faded.
He was a man -- a member of the ruling race. She was an animal --
a beast -- a humanoid -- near human but not near enough. To like
her was easy - but to love her was impossible. It would be
bestiality. Yet his body, less discerning than his mind,
responded to her nearness.

<P>He sighed. It was a pleasant unpleasantness, a mixed emotion
he could not analyze. In a way it was poetry -- the fierce,
vaguely disquieting poetry of the sensual Santosian bards - the
lyrics that sung of the joys of flesh. He had never really liked
them, yet they filled him with a vague longing, an odd uneasiness
-- just the sort that filled him now. There was a deadly parallel
here. He sighed.

<P>&quot;Yes, sir? Do you want something?&quot; Copper asked.

<P>&quot;I could use a cup of coffee,&quot; he said. &quot;These
reports are getting me down.&quot; The banality amused him --
sitting here thinking of Copper and talking about coffee.
Banality was at once the curse and the saving grace of mankind.
It kept men from the emotional peaks and valleys that could
destroy them. He chuckled shakily. The only alternative would be
to get rid of her -- and he couldn't (<I>or wouldn't?</I> -- the
question intruded slyly) do that.

<P>Copper returned with a steaming cup which she set before him.
Truly, this coffee was a man's drink. She had tried it once but
the hot bitterness scalded her mouth and flooded her body with
its heat. And she had felt so lightheaded. Not like herself at
all. It wasn't a drink for Lani. Of that she was certain.

<P>Yet he enjoyed it. He looked at her and smiled. He was pleased
with her. Perhaps -- yet -- she might find favor in his eyes. The
hope was always there within her -- a hope that was at once fear
and prayer. And if she did -- she would know what to do.

<P>Kennon looked up. Copper's face was convulsed with a bright
mixture of hope and pain. Never, he swore, had he saw anything
more beautiful or sad. Involuntarily he placed his hand upon her
arm. She flinched, her muscles tensing under his finger tips. It
was though his fingers carried a galvanic current that backlashed
up his arm even as it stiffened hers.

<P>&quot;What's the matter, Copper?&quot; he asked softly.

<P>&quot;Nothing, Doctor. I'm just upset.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;

<P>There it was again, the calm friendly curiosity that was worse
than a bath in ice water. Her heart sank. She shivered. She would
never find her desire here. He was cold -- cold- cold! He
wouldn't see. He didn't care. All right -- so that was how it had
to be. But first she would tell him. Then he could do with her as
he wished. &quot;I hoped -- for the past year that you would see
me. That you would think of me not as a Lani, but as a
beloved.&quot; The words came faster now, tumbling over one
another. &quot;That you would desire me and take me to those
worlds we cannot know unless you humans show us. I have hoped so
much, but I suppose it's wrong - for you -- you are so very
human, and I -- well, I'm not!&quot; The last three words held
all the sadness and the longing of mankind aspiring to be God.

<P>&quot;My dear -- my poor child,&quot; Kennon murmured.

<P>She looked at him, but her eyes could not focus on his face,
for his hands were on her shoulders and the nearness of him drove
the breath from her body. From a distance she heard a hard tight
voice that was her own. &quot;Oh, sir -- oh <I>please</I>,
sir!&quot;

<P>The hands withdrew, leaving emptiness -- but her heartbeat
slowed and the pink haze cleared and she could see his face.

<P>And with a surge of terror and triumph she realized what she
saw! That hard bright look that encompassed and possessed her!
The curved lips drawn over white, white teeth! The flared
nostrils! The hungry demand upon his face that answered the
demand in her heart! And she knew -- at last - with a knowledge
that turned her limbs to water, that she had found favor in his
eyes!

<P>CHAPTER XI

<P>Mixed emotion! Ha! The author of that cliche didn't even know
its meaning! Kennon strode furiously down the dusty road toward
Station One trying to sublimate his inner conflict into action.
It was useless, of course, for once he stopped moving the grim
tug-of-war between training and desire would begin again, and no
matter how it ended the result would be unsatisfactory. As long
as he had been able to delude himself that he was fond of Copper
the way a man is fond of some lesser species, it had been all
right. But he knew now that he was fond of her as a man is of a
woman -- and it was hell! For no rationalization in the universe
would allow him to define her as human. Copper was humanoid --
something <I>like</I> human. And to live with her and love her
would not be miscegenation, which was bad enough, but bestiality
which was a thousand times worse.

<P>Although throughout most of the Brotherhood miscegenation was
an unknown word, and even bestiality had become a loose
definition on many worlds with humanoid populations, the words
had definite meaning and moral force to a Betan. And -- God help
him -- he was a Betan. A lifetime of training in a moral code
that frowned upon mixed marriages and shrank appalled from even
the thought of mixing species was nothing to bring face to face
with the fact that he loved Copper.

<P>It was odd, Kennon reflected bitterly, that humans could do
with animals what their customs and codes prohibited them from
doing to themselves. For thousands of years - back to the very
dawn of history when men had bred horses and asses to produce
mules -- men had been mixing species to produce useful hybrids.
Yet a Betan who could hybridize plants or animals with complete
equanimity shrank with horror from the thought of applying the
same technique to himself.

<P>What was there about a human being that was so sacrosanct? He
shook his head angrily. He didn't know. There was no answer. But
the idea -- the belief -- was there, ingrained into his
attitudes, a part of his outlook, built carefully block by block
from infancy until it now towered into a mighty wall that barred
him from doing what he wished to do.

<P>It would be an easier hurdle if he had been born anywhere
except on Beta. In the rest of the Brotherhood, the color of a
man's skin, the shape of his face, the quality and color of his
hair and eyes made no difference. All men were brothers. But on
Beta, where a variant-G sun had already caused genetic
divergence, the brotherhood of man was a term that was merely
given lip service. Betans were different and from birth they were
taught to accept the difference and to live with it. Mixing of
Betan stock with other human species, while not actually
forbidden, was so encircled with conditioning that it was a rare
Betan indeed who would risk self-opprobrium and the contempt of
his fellows to mate with an outsider. And as for humanoids --
Kennon shuddered. He couldn't break the attitudes of a lifetime.
Yet he loved Copper.

<P>And she knew he did!

<P>And that was an even greater horror. He had fled from the
office, from the glad light in her eyes, as a burned child flees
fire. He needed time to think, time to plan. Yet his body and his
surface thoughts wanted no plans or time. Living with a Lani
wasn't frowned upon on Flora. Many of the staff did, nor did
anyone seem to think less of them for doing so. Even Alexander
himself had half-confessed to a more than platonic affection for
a Lani called Susy.

<P>Yet this was no excuse, nor would it silence the cold still
voice in his mind that kept repeating <I>sodomite -- sodomite --
sodomite</I> with a passionless inflection that was even more
terrible than anger.

<P>The five kilometers to Station One disappeared unnoticed
beneath his feet as he walked, and he looked up in surprise to
see the white walls and red roofs of the station looming before
him.

<P>&quot;Good Lord! Doc! What's got into you?&quot; the
stationmaster said. &quot;You look like you'd seen a ghost. And
out in this sun without a helmet! Come inside, man, before you
get sunstroke!&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled without humor. &quot;Getting sunstroke is the
least of my worries, Al,&quot; he said, but he allowed Al
Crothers to usher him inside.

<P>&quot;It's odd that you showed up right now,&quot; Al said,
his dark face showing the curiosity that filled him. &quot;I just
had a call from Message Center not five minutes ago, telling me
to have you call in if you showed up.&quot;


<P>Kennon sighed. &quot;On this island you can't get away from
the phone,&quot; he said wryly. &quot;O.K., where is it?&quot;

<P>&quot;You look pretty bushed, Doc. Maybe you'd better rest
awhile.&quot;

<P>&quot;And maybe it's an emergency,&quot; Kennon interrupted.
&quot;And probably it is because the staff can handle routine
matters -- so maybe you'd better show me where you keep the
phone.&quot;

<P>* * *

<P>&quot;One moment please,&quot; the Message Center operator
said. There were a few clicks in the background. &quot;Here's
your party,&quot; she continued. &quot;Go ahead, Doctor.&quot;

<P>&quot;Kennon?&quot; a nervous voice crackled from the
receiver.

<P>&quot;Yes?&quot;

<P>&quot;You're needed out on Otpen One.&quot;

<P>&quot;Who is calling -- and what's the rush?&quot;

<P>&quot;Douglas -- Douglas Alexander. The Lani are dying! It's
an emergency! Cousin Alex'll skin us alive if we let these Lani
die!&quot;

<P>Douglas! Kennon hadn't thought of him since the one time they
had met in Alexandria. That was a year ago. It seemed much
longer. Since the Boss-man had exiled his cousin to that bleak
rock to the east of Flora there had been no word of him. And now
-- he laughed a sharp bark of humorless annoyance -- Douglas
couldn't have timed it better if he had tried!

<P>&quot;All right,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I'll come. What
seems to be the trouble?&quot;

<P>&quot;They're sick.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's obvious,&quot; Kennon snapped. &quot;Otherwise
you wouldn't be calling. Can't you tell me any more than
that?&quot;

<P>&quot;They're vomiting. They have diarrhea. Several have had
fits.&quot;

<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I'll be right out.
Expect me in an hour.&quot;

<P>&quot;So you're leaving?&quot; Al asked as he cradled the
phone.

<P>&quot;That's a practitioner's life,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;Full of interruptions. Can I borrow your jeep?&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll drive you. Where do you want to go?&quot;

<P>&quot;To the hospital,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I'll have to
pick up my gear. It's an emergency all right.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're a tough one,&quot; Al said admiringly. &quot;I'd
hate to walk five kilos in this heat without a hat -- and then go
out on a call.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. &quot;It's not necessarily toughness. I
believe in doing one job at a time -- and my contract reads
veterinary service, not personal problems. The job comes first
and there's work to do.&quot;

<P>Copper wasn't in sight when Kennon came back to the hospital
-- a fact for which he was grateful. He packed quickly, threw his
bags into the jeep, and took off with almost guilty haste. He'd
contact the Hospital from the Otpens. Right now all he wanted was
to put distance between himself and Copper. Absence might make
the heart grow fonder, but at the moment propinquity was by far
the more dangerous thing. He pointed the blunt nose of the jeep
toward Mount Olympus, set the autopilot, opened the throttle, and
relaxed as best he could as the little vehicle sped at top speed
for the outer islands. A vague curiosity filled him. He'd never
been on the Otpens. He wondered what they were like.

<P>* * *

<P>Otpen One was a rocky tree-clad islet crowned with the
stellate mass of a Class II Fortalice. But this one wasn't like
Alexandria. It was fully manned and in service condition.

<P>&quot;Airboat!&quot; a voice crackled from the dashboard
speaker of the jeep, &quot;Identify yourself! You are being
tracked.&quot;

<P>Kennon quickly flipped the IFF switch. &quot;Dr. Kennon, from
Flora,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;Thank you, sir. You are expected and are clear to land.
Bring your vehicle down in the marked area.&quot; A section of
the roof turned a garish yellow as Kennon circled the building.
He brought the jeep in lightly, setting it carefully in the
center of the area.

<P>&quot;Leave your vehicle,&quot; the speaker chattered.
&quot;If you are armed leave your weapon behind.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's not my habit to carry a gun,&quot; Kennon snapped.

<P>&quot;Sorry, sir -- regulations,&quot; the speaker said.
'&quot;This is S.O.P.&quot;

<P>Kennon left the jeep and instantly felt the probing tingle of
a search beam. He looked around curiously at the flat roof of the
fortress with its domed turrets and ugly snouts of the main
battery projectors pointing skyward. Beside him, the long metal
doors of a missile launcher made a rectangular trace on the
smooth surface of the roof. Behind him the central tower poked
its gaunt ferromorph and durilium outline into the darkening sky
bearing its crown of spiderweb radar antennae turning steadily on
their gimbals covering a vast hemisphere from horizon to zenith
with endless inspection.

<P>From the base of the tower a man emerged. He was tall, taller
even than Kennon, and the muscles of his body showed through the
tightness of his battle dress. His face was harsh, and in his
hands he carried a Burkholtz magnum -- the most powerful portable
weapon mankind had yet devised.

<P>&quot;You are Dr. Kennon?&quot; the trooper asked.

<P>&quot;I am.&quot;

<P>&quot;Your I.D., please.&quot;

<P>Kennon handed it over and the big man scanned the card with
practiced eyes. &quot;Check,&quot; he said. &quot;Follow me,
sir.&quot;

<P>&quot;My bags,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;They'll be taken care of.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged and followed the man into the tower. A modern
grav-shaft lowered them to the ground floor. They passed through
a gloomy caricature of the Great Hall in Alexandria, through an
iris, and down a long corridor lined with doors.

<P>A bell rang.

<P>&quot;Back!&quot; the trooper said. &quot;Against the wall!
Quick! Into the doorway!&quot;

<P>&quot;What's up?&quot;

<P>&quot;Another practice alert.&quot; The trooper's voice was
bored. &quot;It gets so that you'd almost wish for a fight to
relieve the monotony.&quot;

<P>A trooper and several Lani came down the corridor, running in
disciplined formation. Steel clanged on steel as they turned the
corner and moments later the whine of servos came faintly to
their ears. From somewhere deep in the pile a rising crescendo of
generators under full battle load sent out vibrations that could
be sensed rather than heard. A klaxon squawked briefly. There was
another clash of metal, and a harsh voice boomed through the
corridors. &quot;Fourteen seconds. Well done. Secure
stations!&quot;

<P>The trooper grinned. &quot;That ties the record,&quot; he
said. &quot;We can go now.&quot;

<P>The corridor ended abruptly at an iris flanked by two
sentries. They conferred briefly with Kennon's guide, dilated the
iris, and motioned for Kennon to enter. The pastel interior of
the modern office was a shocking contrast to the gray ferromorph
corridors outside.

<P>Douglas Alexander was standing behind the desk. He was much
the same. His pudgy face was haggard with uncertainty and his
eyes darted back and forth as his fingers caressed the knobby
grip of a small Burkholtz jutting from a holster at his waist.
There were new, unpleasant furrows between his eyes. He looked
older and the indefinable air of cruelty was more pronounced. He
had been frightened the last time Kennon had seen him, and he was
frightened now.

<P>&quot;I'm not sure whether I am glad to see you, Kennon,&quot;
he said uncertainly. &quot;But I suppose I have to be.&quot;

<P>Kennon believed him.

<P>&quot;How have you been?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Not too bad until this afternoon. Things have been going
pretty well.&quot; He shifted uncomfortably from one foot to
another. &quot;I suppose Cousin Alex will skin me for this, but
there's nothing else I can do.&quot; He licked his lips.
&quot;You've been here long enough -- and you'll have to know
eventually.&quot; He fidgeted and finally sat down behind the
desk. &quot;We have trouble. Half the Lani were stricken about
four hours ago. It was sudden. No warning at all. And if they
die----&quot; his voice trailed off.

<P>&quot;Well -- what are we waiting for? Get someone to bring my
bags down here and we'll look them over.&quot;

<P>&quot;Do you have to? -- Can't you prescribe something?&quot;

<P>&quot;How? I haven't examined the patients.&quot;

<P>&quot;I can tell you what's wrong.&quot;

<P>Kennon smiled. &quot;I hardly think that's the way to do it.
Even though your description might be accurate, you still might
miss something of critical importance.&quot;

<P>Douglas sighed. &quot;I thought that's what you'd say,&quot;
he said. &quot;Oh -- very well -- you might as well see what we
have out here.&quot;

<P>&quot;You can't possibly believe that I don't already
know,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;You have male Lani.&quot;

<P>Douglas looked at him, his face blank with surprise. &quot;But
-- how did you know? No one on the main island does except the
Family. And we never talk about it. Did Eloise tell you? I
noticed she was struck with you the day you came, and the Lani
who have come out here since have been talking about you two. Did
she do it?&quot;

<P>Kennon shook his head. &quot;She never said a word.&quot;

<P>&quot;Then how----&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm not stupid,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;That story
you've spread about artificial fertilization has more holes in it
than a sieve. That technique has been investigated a thousand
times. And it has never worked past the first generation. If you
had been using it, the Lani would long ago have been extinct.
Haploids don't reproduce, and the only way the diploid number of
chromosomes can be kept is to replace those lost by maturation
division of the ovum. You might be able to keep the diploid
number by using immature ova, but the fertilization technique
would be far more complex than the simple uterine injections you
use at Hillside Station.&quot;

<P>Douglas looked at him blankly.

<P>&quot;Besides,&quot; Kennon added, &quot;I have a microscope.
I checked your so-called fertilizing solution. I found
spermatozoa, and spermatozoa only come from males. What's more,
the males have to be the same species as the females or
fertilization will not take place. So there must be male Lani.
Nothing else fits. You've been using artificial insemination on
the main-island Lani. And from the way this place is guarded,
it's obvious that here is your stud farm.&quot;

<P>Douglas shrugged and spread his hands in a gesture of
resignation. &quot;I suppose,&quot; he said, &quot;that's the way
Old Doc found out too. We never told him, but he knew before he
ever came out here.&quot;

<P>&quot;The only thing that puzzles me,&quot; Kennon went on,
&quot;is how you managed to eliminate the Y-chromosome carriers
within the sperm.&quot;

<P>&quot;Eh?&quot;

<P>&quot;The male sex-determinant. Half the sperm carry it, but
so far as I know, there's never been a male born on the main
island.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh -- that. It's something that's done in the labs here.
Probably one of the technicians could tell you. It's called
electro-- electro freezing or something like that.&quot;

<P>&quot;Electrodiaphoresis?&quot;

<P>Douglas nodded. &quot;That sounds like it. I don't know
anything about it. One of Grandfather's men did the basic work.
We just follow instructions.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Well -
since you know the secret there's no sense in hiding the bodies.
Come along and tell me what's wrong.&quot;

<P>It was a peculiar feeling to walk down the row of cubical
rooms with their barred doors. The whole area reminded him of a
historical novel, of the prisons of early human history where men
confined other men for infractions of social customs. The
grimness of the place was appalling. The male Lani -- impressive
in their physical development -- were in miserable condition,
nauseated, green-faced, retching. The sickening odors of vomit
and diarrhea hung heavily on the air. Douglas coughed and held a
square of cloth to his face, and even Kennon, strong-stomached as
he was, could feel his viscera twitch in sympathy with the caged
sufferers.

<P>&quot;Great Fleming, man!&quot; Kennon exploded. &quot;You
can't keep them here. Get them out! Give them some fresh air!
This place would make a well man sick.&quot;

<P>Douglas looked at him, &quot;I wouldn't take one of them out
unless I had him shackled and there was an armed guard to help
me. Those males are the most vicious, cunning, and dangerous
animals on Kardon. They exist with but one thought in mind -- to
kill!&quot;

<P>Kennon looked curiously through a barred door at one of the
Lani. He lay on a bare cot, a magnificently muscled figure with a
ragged black beard hiding his face. There were dozens of scars on
his body and one angry purple area on his thick right forearm
where flesh had been torn away not too long ago. Beads of sweat
stood out on his forehead and soft moaning noises came from his
tight lips as he pressed his abdomen with thick-fingered hands.
&quot;He doesn't look so dangerous,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;Watch it!&quot; Douglas warned. &quot;Don't get too
close!&quot; But the warning was too late. Kennon touched the
bars, and as he did, the Lani moved with fluid speed, one huge
hand clutching Kennon's sleeve and pulling him against the bars
while the other darted for his throat. Fingers bit into Kennon's
neck and tightened in a viselike grip. Kennon reacted
automatically. His arms came up inside the Lani's and crashed
down, elbows out, tearing the Lani loose. He jumped back, rubbing
his bruised throat. &quot;That fellow's not sick!&quot; he
gasped. &quot;He's crazy!&quot;

<P>The Lani glared at him through the bars, disappointment
written on his scarred and bearded face.

<P>&quot;I warned you,&quot; Douglas said. His voice held an
undertone of malicious laughter. &quot;He must be sick or he
would have killed you. George is clever in a stupid sort of
way.&quot;

<P>Kennon looked into the cubicle. The Lani glared back and
growled. There was a beastlike note in his voice that made the
short hairs on Kennon's neck prickle.

<P>&quot;That fellow needs a lesson,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;You want to give it to him?&quot; Douglas asked.

<P>&quot;Not particularly.&quot;

<P>&quot;Ha! -- man! -- you afraid!&quot; the Lani taunted. His
voice was thick and harsh. &quot;All men fear me. All Lani, too.
I am boss. Come close again man and I kill you!&quot;

<P>&quot;Are they all that stupid?&quot; Kennon asked. &quot;He
sounds like a homicidal moron.&quot;

<P>&quot;He's not stupid,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;Just
uneducated.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why is he so murderous?&quot;

<P>&quot;That's his training. All his life he has fought. From
childhood his life has been based on his ability to survive in an
environment where every male is his enemy. You see here the
sublimation of individuality. He cannot co-operate with another
male. He hates them, and they in turn hate him. George, here, is
a perfect example of absolute freedom from restraint.&quot;
Douglas smiled unpleasantly.

<P>&quot;His whole history is one of complete lack of control. As
an infant, being a male, his mother thought she was favored by
the gods and she denied him nothing. In fact we were quite
insistent that she gave him everything he wanted. By the time he
was able to walk and take care of himself, he was completely
spoiled, selfish, and authoritative.

<P>&quot;Then we took him and a dozen others exactly like him and
put them together.&quot; Douglas grinned. &quot;You should see
what happens when a dozen spoiled brats are forced to live
together. It's more fun. The little beasts hate each other on
sight. And we stimulate them to compete for toys, food, and
drink. Never quite enough to go around. You can imagine what
happens. Instead of sharing, each little selfish individualist
fights to get everything he can grab. Except for one thing we
don't punish them no matter what they do. If anyone shows signs
of co-operating he is disciplined severely, the first time. The
next time, he is culled. But other than that, we leave them
alone. They develop their personalities and their muscles -- and
if one proves to be too much for his fellows we transfer him to a
more advanced class where the competition is keener, and he
learns what it is to lose.

<P>&quot;At puberty we add sex drive to the basics, and by the
time our male reaches maturity we have something like George.
Actually, George is more mature than either you or I. He has all
the answers he needs. He's strong, solitary, authoritative, and
selfish. He has no curiosity and resents encroachment. He's a
complete individualist. If he proves out he should make an
excellent sire.&quot;

<P>&quot;But isn't he dangerous to handle?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Yes, but we take precautions.&quot;

<P>Kennon grimaced with distaste.

<P>&quot;Look at it objectively,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;We're
trying to select the best physical type we can in the hope that
he'll pass his qualities to his offspring, and there's no better
practical way to select the strongest and hardiest than by
natural selection. We control their environment as little as
possible and let Nature do our educating until they're old enough
to be useful.

<P>&quot;Naturally, there are some things which we cannot
provide, such as exposure to disease, to the elements, and to
predators. The one isn't selective about whom it infects, while
the others would tend to produce co-operation as a matter of
survival.&quot;

<P>&quot;Isn't there a great deal of mortality under such a
regimen?'' Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Not as much as you might expect. It's about twenty per
cent. And there is a great deal of compensation from a management
viewpoint. We get essentially the same physical end product as we
would from a closely managed operation, plus a great saving in
labor. Males, you see, are fairly expendable. We only need a few
a year.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's brutal.&quot;

<P>&quot;So it is, but life is brutal. Still, it's efficient for
our purposes. We merely take advantage of natural impulses to
produce a better product. Grandfather got the idea out of an old
book -- something about the noble savage, natural selection and
survival of the fittest. He thought it was great - said there was
nothing like relentless competition to bring out the strongest
and hardiest types. And he's been right for centuries. Can you
imagine anything much better than George -- from a physical
viewpoint?&quot;

<P>&quot;He is a magnificent animal,&quot; Kennon admitted as he
eyed the Lani. &quot;But it seems to me that you could train some
obedience into him.&quot;

<P>Douglas shook his head. &quot;That would introduce a modifying
factor, something bigger and more powerful than the male himself.
And that would modify the results. We can control them well
enough with knockout gas and shackles. And those things, oddly
enough, don't destroy their pride or self-esteem. They think that
we use them because we are afraid, and it satisfies their
egos.&quot;

<P>Kennon eyed the caged Lani dubiously. &quot;This is going to
be difficult. I must examine them and treat them, but if they're
all as homicidal as this one--&quot;

<P>&quot;You fight me man,&quot; George interrupted, his face
twisted into lines of transparent guile. &quot;I am boss and
others do as I say. You beat me, then you are boss.&quot;

<P>&quot;Is this true?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Oh, it's true enough,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;George
is the leader and if you beat him you'd be top male until some
other one got courage enough to challenge you. But he's just
trying to get his hands on you. He'd like to kill.&quot;

<P>Kennon looked at the big humanoid appraisingly. George was
huge, at least five centimeters taller and fifteen kilograms
heavier than himself. And he was all muscle. &quot;I don't think
I'd care to accept that challenge unless I was forced to,&quot;
Kennon said.

<P>Douglas chuckled. &quot;I don't blame you.&quot;

<P>Kennon sighed. &quot;It looks like we are going to need
reinforcements to get these brutes under control. I'm not going
in there with them, and I can't examine them from out here.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh, we can hold them all right. Paralysis gas and
shackles will keep them quiet. There's no need to bother the
troopers. We can handle this by ourselves.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. &quot;It's your baby. You should know what
you're doing.&quot;

<P>&quot;I do,&quot; Douglas said confidently. &quot;Wait here
until I get the gas capsules and the equipment.'' He turned and
walked back to the entrance to the cell block. At the iris he
turned. &quot;Be careful,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;Don't worry, I will.&quot; Kennon looked at George
through the bars and the humanoid glared back, his eyes bright
with hatred. Kennon felt the short hairs prickle along the back
of his neck. George roused a primal emotion -- an elemental
dislike that was deeper than reason -- an antagonism intensely
physical, almost overpowering -- a purely adrenal response that
had no business in the make-up of a civilized human.

<P>He had thought the Lani had a number of human traits until he
had encountered George. But if George was a typical male -- then
the Lani were alien. He flexed his muscles and stared coldly into
the burning blue eyes behind the bars. There would be
considerable satisfaction in beating this monstrosity to a
quivering pulp. Millennia of human pre-eminence -- of belief that
nothing, no matter how big or muscular, should fail to recognize
that a man's person was inviolate -- fed the fuel of his anger.
The most ferocious beasts on ten thousand worlds had learned this
lesson. And yet this animal had laid hands on him with intent to
kill. A cold corner of his mind kept telling him that he wasn't
behaving rationally, but he disregarded it. George was a walking
need for a lesson in manners.

<P>&quot;Don't get the idea that I'm afraid of you -- you
overmuscled oaf,&quot; Kennon snapped. &quot;I can handle you or
anyone like you. And if you put your hands on me again I'll beat
you within an inch of your worthless life.&quot;

<P>The Lani snarled. &quot;Let me out and I kill you. But you are
like all men. You use gun and iron -- not fair fight.&quot;

<P>Douglas returned with a gas capsule and a set of shackles.
&quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;We're ready for him.&quot;
He handed Kennon the shackles and a key to the cell door -- and
drew his Burkholtz.

<P>&quot;See,&quot; the Lani growled. &quot;It is as I say. Men
are cowards.&quot;

<P>&quot;You know gun?&quot; Douglas asked as he pointed the
muzzle of the Burkholtz at the Lani.

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; George growled. &quot;Gun kill.&quot;

<P>&quot;It does indeed,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;Now get back
-- clear back against the wall.&quot;

<P>George snarled but didn't move.

<P>&quot;I'll count three,&quot; Douglas said, &quot;and if
you're not back by then I'll burn you down. You'll obey even if
you won't do anything else. -- one -- two--&quot;

<P>George retreated to the far end of his cell.

<P>&quot;Now face the wall.&quot; Douglas tossed the gas capsule
into the cell. The thin-walled container broke, releasing a cloud
of vapor. George crumpled to the floor. &quot;Now we wait a
couple of minutes for the gas to dissipate,&quot; Douglas said.
&quot;After that he's all yours. You can go in and put the irons
on him.&quot;

<P>&quot;Will he be out long?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;About five minutes. After that he'll have muscular
control.&quot; Douglas chuckled. &quot;They're stupid,&quot; he
said. &quot;They know what gas does to them, but they never have
sense enough to hold their breath. They could be twice as much
trouble as they are. All right, it's safe to go in now.&quot;
Douglas let the gun dangle in his hand.

<P>Kennon unlocked the door.

<P>And George rolled over, muscles bunched and driving! He hit
the door with such force that Kennon was slammed against the
wall, dazed -- half stunned by the speed of the attack. George --
he had time to think in one brief flash -- wasn't stupid. He had
held his breath for the necessary two minutes!

<P>Douglas jerked the blaster up and fired, but his target was
too quick. George dropped and rolled. The sizzling streak of
violet flashed inches above his body and tore a six-inch hole
through the back of the cell. And then George was on him! The
huge, marvelously fast hands of the humanoid wrenched the blaster
out of Douglas's hands and jerked him forward. A scream burst
from Douglas as George's hands closed around his neck. Muscles
sprang into writhing life in the humanoid's huge forearms. There
was a soft, brittle crack, and Douglas sagged limp in the iron
grip that held him dangling.

<P>&quot;Faugh!&quot; George grunted. He dropped Douglas as
Kennon pushed the door back and came out into the passageway.
&quot;Maybe you make better fight,&quot; George said as he
lowered his head into the muscular mass of his broad shoulders.

<P>Kennon eyed him appraisingly, swinging the irons in his right
hand.

<P>This time the Lani didn't charge. He moved slowly, half
crouched, long arms held slightly forward. Kennon backed away,
watching the humanoid's eyes for that telltale flicker of the
pupils that gives warning of attack. The expression on George's
face never changed. It was satisfied -- smug almost -- reflecting
the feelings of a brute conditioned to kill and given an
opportunity to do so. The Lani radiated confidence.

<P>Kennon shivered involuntarily. He wasn't frightened, but he
had never met an opponent like this. A chill raced up the back of
his legs and spread over his stomach and chest. His mouth was dry
and his muscles quivered with tense anticipation. But his
concentration never wavered. His hard blue eyes never left
George's, searching with microscopic intentness for the faintest
sign of the Lani's intentions.

<P>George charged -- hands reaching for Kennon's throat, face
twisted in a snarl of rage and hate. But even as he charged
Kennon moved. He ducked beneath the Lani's outstretched hands and
drove his left fist deep into George's belly just below the
breastbone.

<P>Air whistled out of the Lani's gaping mouth as he bent double
from the power of the blow. Kennon clipped him on the chin with a
driving knee, snapping George's head back and smashed the bearded
face with the shackles. Blood spurted and George screamed with
rage. One of the Lani's big hands wrapped around the shackles and
tugged. Kennon let go and drove another left to George's ribs.

<P>The Lani threw the irons at Kennon, but his aim was poor. One
of the handcuff rings scraped across Kennon's cheek, but did
nothing more than break the skin. Half paralyzed by the blows to
his solar plexus, George's co-ordination was badly impaired. But
he kept trying. Kennon wrapped lean fingers about one of George's
outstretched hands, bent, pivoted, and slammed the Lani with
bone-crushing force against the bars of a nearby cell. But George
didn't go down. &quot;He's more brute than man,&quot; Kennon
thought. &quot;No man could take a beating like that!&quot; He
moved aside from George's stumbling rush, feeling a twinge of
pity for the battered humanoid. It was no contest. Strong as he
was, George didn't know the rudiments of hand-to-hand fighting.
His reactions were those of an animal, to close, clutch, bite,
and tear. Even if he were completely well, the results would have
been the same. It would merely have taken longer. Kennon drove a
vicious judo chop to the junction of the Lani's neck and
shoulder. Brute strength was no match for the highly evolved
mayhem that every spaceman learns as a necessary part of his
trade. George had never been on planet leave in a spaceport town.
He knew nothing about the dives, the crimps, the hostile port
police. His idea of fighting was that of a beast, but Kennon was
a civilized man to whom fighting was an art perfected by
millennia of warfare. And Kennon knew his trade.

<P>Even so it took longer than Kennon expected because George was
big, George was strong, and George had courage and pride that
kept him coming as long as the blazing will behind his blazing
eyes could drive his battered body. But the end was inevitable.

<P>Kennon looked at his bloody arm where George's teeth had
reached their mark. It was hardly more than a scratch, but it had
been close. George had his lesson and Kennon felt oddly degraded.
He sighed, dragged George back into the cell, and locked the
door.

<P>Then he turned to Douglas. The howls of hate from the caged
Lani died to a sullen silence as Kennon gently examined the limp
body.

<P>Douglas wasn't dead. His neck was dislocated, not broken, but
he was in serious condition. Kennon was still bending over
Douglas wondering how to call for help when three guards burst
through the door, faces grim, weapons at the ready.

<P>&quot;What's going on here?&quot; the leader demanded.
&quot;The board showed an open door down here.&quot; He saw the
body-- &quot;Mr. Douglas!&quot; he gasped. &quot;The commandant
will have to know about this!&quot; He took a communicator from
his waist belt and spoke rapidly into it. &quot;Arleson in stud
cell block,&quot; he said. &quot;Attempted escape. One casualty
-- Douglas Alexander - yes, that's right. No -- he's not dead.
Send a litter and bearers. Inform the commandant. I am making
investigation on the spot. Out.&quot; He turned to look coldly at
Kennon.

<P>&quot;Who are you--and what happened here?&quot; he asked.

<P>Kennon told him.

<P>&quot;You mean you took <I>George!</I>&quot; Arleson said.

<P>&quot;Look in his cell if you don't believe me.&quot;

<P>The soldier looked and then turned hack to Kennon. There was
awed respect in his hard brown eyes. &quot;You did <I>that!</I>
-- to <I>him!</I> Man, you're a fighter,&quot; he said in an
unbelieving voice.

<P>A stretcher detail manned by two sober-faced Lani females came
in, loaded Douglas's body on the stretcher, and silently bore it
away.

<P>&quot;Douglas was a fool,&quot; Arleson said. &quot;He knew we
never handle this kind without maximum restraint. I wonder why he
did it?&quot;

<P>&quot;I couldn't say. He told me that gas and shackles would
hold him.&quot;

<P>&quot;He knew better. These Lani know gas capsules. All George
bad to do was hold his breath. In that cell George would have
killed you. You couldn't have stayed away from him.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. Maybe that was what Douglas had wanted.
Kennon sighed. He didn't have the answer. And it could just be
that Douglas had tried to show off. Well, he would pay for it.
He'd have a stiff neck for months, and perhaps that was a proper
way to end it.

<P>* * *

<P>Commander Mullins, a thin gray-faced man with the hard cold
eyes of a professional soldier, came into the corridor followed
by another trooper.

<P>His eyes took in the wreckage that had been George, the split
lips, the smashed nose, the puffed eyes, the cuts and bruises,
and then raked across Kennon.

<P>&quot;Spaceman -- hey?&quot; he asked. &quot;I've seen work
like that before.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded. &quot;I was once. I'm station veterinarian now.
Douglas called me over -- said it was an emergency.&quot;

<P>Mullins nodded.

<P>&quot;Well -- why aren't you tending to it?&quot;

<P>&quot;I have to examine them,&quot; Kennon said gesturing at
the cells. &quot;And I don't want any more trouble like
this.&quot;

<P>&quot;Don't worry. You won't have it. Now that you've beaten
George, you'll have no trouble at all. You're top dog.&quot;
Mullins gestured at the cages. &quot;They'll be good for a while.
Now you'd better get on with your work. There's been enough
disruption of routine for today. The men will help you.&quot;

<P>* * *

<P>Kennon checked in at the commandant's office before he left
for the main island.

<P>&quot;How is Douglas?&quot; he asked.

<P>&quot;He's alive,&quot; Mullins said. &quot;We flew him to
Albertsville - and good riddance. How are the Lani?&quot;

<P>&quot;They'll be all right,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;It's just
food poisoning. I suggest you check your kitchen and your food
handlers. There's a break in sanitation that could incapacitate
your whole command. I found a few things wrong but there are
probably more.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll check on it -- and thanks for the advice,&quot;
Mullins said. &quot;Sit down, Doctor. Your airboat won't be
serviced for another few minutes. Tell me how things are on the
main island. How's Blalok?&quot;

<P>&quot;You know him?&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course. I used to be a frequent visitor there. But
with that young pup here, I couldn't leave. I didn't dare to.
He'd have disrupted routine in a single day. Look what he did in
half an hour. Frankly, I owe you a debt for getting him off my
hands.&quot; Mullins chuckled dryly.

<P>&quot;That's a fine thing to say,&quot; Kennon grinned.
&quot;But I can sympathize. It took us two months to straighten
out Alexandria after the Boss-man sent him here.&quot;

<P>&quot;I heard about that.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well -- we're under control now. Things are going pretty
smoothly.&quot;

<P>&quot;They'll be better here,&quot; Mullins said. &quot;Now
that Douglas is gone.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I hope the Boss
doesn't send him back. He's hard to handle and he makes
discipline a problem.&quot;

<P>&quot;Could you tell me--or would it be violating
security?&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Why do you have a Class II
installation on full war footing out here?&quot;

<P>Mullins chuckled. It's no secret,&quot; he said. &quot;There
was a  commercial raid on this place about fifty years ago. Seems
as though one of our competitors didn't like us. Alexandria was
on a war footing then and managed to hold them off. But it scared
the Old Man. You see, our competitive position is based on Lani
labor. Our competitors didn't know that. Their intelligence
wasn't so good. Up until that time, we'd  been keeping the males
out here in what was hardly more than a stockade. Those people
could have taken a few dozen  females and a couple of males and
they'd have been in business. But they didn't know. They tried to
smash Alexandria instead. Naturally they didn't have a chance.
And after it was over the Old Man got smart. He still had the
tapes for Alexandria so he built a duplicate out here and spent a
few millions on modern armament. The way we're set now it'd take
a battle group to hurt us.''

<P>&quot;But how about security? Don't the others know about the
Lani now?&quot;

<P>&quot;It's a moot question. But it won't do them any good.
They can't crack this place, and without males, all the females
on Flora wouldn't do them enough long-term good to pay for the
force they'd need to be successful.&quot;

<P>&quot;So that's why the males are isolated.&quot;

<P>&quot;There's another reason -- two of them in fact. One is
physical. Even the best male is a dangerous beast. They have a
flair for violence that makes them useless as labor and their
training doesn't help matters. And the other is mental. The
females on the main island believe that we humans are responsible
for the continuation of their breed. This tends to keep them in
line. We have a great deal more trouble with them out here once
they know the truth. We've had a number of cases of females
trying to engineer a male's escape. But they're never
repeated,&quot; Mullins said grimly. &quot;Actually, it would be
an interesting life out here, except for the abattoir.&quot; He
grimaced. &quot;That's an unpleasant chore.&quot;

<P>&quot;You mean--&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;Why, certainly. What else could we do with senile
animals?&quot;

<P>&quot;But that's murder!&quot;

<P>Mullins shook his head. &quot;No more than killing a cow for
beef.&quot;

<P>&quot;You know,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;I've never thought of
what happened to aged Lani. Sure, I've never seen one, but --
Lord Lister! -- I'm a fool.&quot;

<P>&quot;You'll get used to the idea,&quot; Mullins said.
&quot;They aren't human, and except for a few, they aren't as
intelligent as a Santosian Varl. I know that they look like us
except for those tails, but that's as far as it goes. I've spent
two hundred years with them and I know what I'm talking
about.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's what Alexander says.&quot;

<P>&quot;He should know. He's lived with them all his life.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well -- perhaps. But I'm not convinced.&quot;

<P>&quot;Neither was Old Doc -- not until the day he died.&quot;

<P>&quot;Did he change then?&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't know. I wasn't there. But Old Doc was a stubborn
cuss.&quot;

<P>Kennon stood up. &quot;I've given instructions for treatment
to your corpsman,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I think I'd better be
getting back. I have some reports to finish.&quot;

<P>Mullins smiled grimly. &quot;You know,&quot; he said, &quot;I
get the feeling that you don't approve of this operation.&quot;

<P>&quot;Frankly, I don't,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;but I signed
a contract.&quot; He turned toward the door and gestured to the
two Lani who waited outside with his bags. &quot;I can find my
way to the roof,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;Well -- good luck,&quot; Mullins said. &quot;We'll call
you again if we need you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Do that,&quot; Kennon replied. He wanted to leave, to
get away from this place and back to the main island. He wanted
to see Copper. He'd be damned if anyone was going to butcher her.
If he had to stay here until she died of old age, he'd do it. But
nobody was going to hurt her.

<P>CHAPTER XII

<P>Kennon wondered if his colleagues in human medicine felt
toward their patients as he did toward the Lani, or if they
ultimately lost their individuality and became mere hosts for
diseases, parasites, and tumors -- vehicles for the practice of
surgical and medical skills -- economic units whose well-being
meant a certain amount of credits. Probably not, he decided. They
were human and their very humanity made them persons rather than
things.

<P>But the possession of individuality was not an asset in the
practice of animal medicine where economics was the main factor
and the satisfaction of the owner the principal personality
problem. The normal farm animals, the shrakes, cattle, sheep,
morks, and swine were no problem. They were merely a job. But the
Lani were different. They weren't human, but they were
intelligent and they did have personality even though they didn't
possess that indefinable quality that separated man from the
beasts. It was hard to treat them with dispassionate objectivity.
In fact, it was impossible.

<P>And this lack of objectivity annoyed him. Should he be this
way? Was he right to identify them as individuals and treat them
as persons rather than things? The passing months had failed to
rob them of their personalities: they had not become the faceless
mass of a herd of cattle or a flock of sheep. They were still not
essentially different from humans -- and wouldn't men themselves
lose many of their human characteristics if they were herded into
barracks and treated as property for forty generations? Wouldn't
men, too, approach the animal condition if they were bred and
treated as beasts, their pedigrees recorded, their types winnowed
and selected? The thought was annoying.

<P>It would be better, Kennon reflected, if he didn't have time
to think, if he were so busy he could drop to his bed exhausted
each night and sleep without dreaming, if he could keep on the
run so fast that he wouldn't have time to sit and reflect. But he
had done his work too well. He had trained his staff too
thoroughly. They could handle the petty routines of minor
treatment and laboratory tests as well as he. He had only the
intellectual stimulation of atypical cases and these were all too
rare. The routine inspections were boring, yet he forced himself
to make them because the filled the time. The hospital wards were
virtually empty of patients, the work was up to date, the whole
island was enjoying a carnival of health, and Kennon was still
impaled upon the horns of his dilemma. It wasn't so bad now that
the first shock was over, but it was bad enough -- and showed no
signs of getting better. Now that Copper realized he wanted her,
she did nothing to make his life easier. Instead she did her best
to get underfoot, usually in some provocative position. It was
enough to try the patience of a marble statue Kennon reflected
grimly. But it did have its humorous side and were it not for the
fact that Copper wasn't human could have been thoroughly
enjoyable. That, however, was the real hell of it. He couldn't
relax and enjoy the contest - his feet were on too slippery
ground. And Copper with her unerring female instinct knew just
what to do to make the footing slipperier. Sooner or later, she
was certain that he would fall. It was only a question of
applying sufficient pressure at the right spot and the right
time. Now that she knew he desired her, she was content to wait.
The only thing that had bothered her was the uncertainty whether
he cared or not. For Copper the future was a simple thing and she
was lighthearted about it. But not so Kennon. Even after the
initial shock had passed there still remained the moral customs,
the conditioning, and the prohibitions. But Copper - was Copper
-- and somehow the conditioning lost its force in her presence.
Perhaps, he thought wryly, it was a symptom of the gradual
erosion of his moral character in this abnormal environment.

<P>&quot;I'm getting stale,&quot; he confided to Copper as he sat
in his office idly turning the pages of the <I>Kardon Journal of
Allied Medical Sciences</I>. &quot;There's nothing to do that's
interesting.&quot;

<P>&quot;You could help me,&quot; Copper said as she looked up
from the pile of cards she was sorting. He had given her the
thankless task of reorganizing the files, and she was barely half
through the project.

<P>&quot;There's nothing to do that's interesting,&quot; he
repeated. He cocked his head to one side. From this angle Copper
looked decidedly intriguing as she bent over the file drawer and
replaced a stack of cards.

<P>&quot;I could suggest something,&quot; Copper said demurely.

<P>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; he said. &quot;You're full of
suggestions.&quot;

<P>&quot;I was thinking that we could go on a picnic.&quot;

<P>&quot;A what?&quot;

<P>&quot;A picnic. Take a lunch and go somewhere in the jeep.
Maybe up into the hills. I think it might be fun.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why not?&quot; Kennon agreed. &quot;At least it would
break the monotony. Tell you what. You run up to the house and
tell Kara to pack a lunch and we'll take the day off.&quot;

<P>&quot;Good! I hoped you'd say that. I'm getting tired of these
dirty old cards.&quot; She stood up and sidled past the desk.
Kennon resisted the impulse to slap as she went past, and
congratulated himself on his self-control as she looked at him
with a half-disappointed expression on her face. She had expected
it, he thought gleefully. Score one for morality.

<P>


<P>He smiled. Whatever the other Lani might be, Copper was
different. Quick, volatile, intelligent, she was a constant
delight, a flashing kaleidoscope of unexpected facets. Perhaps
the others were the same if he knew them better. But he didn't
know them -- and avoided learning. In that direction lay ulcers.

<P>&quot;We'll go to Olympus,&quot; he said.

<P>Copper looked dubious. &quot;I'd rather not go there. That's
forbidden ground.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh nonsense. You're merely superstitious.&quot;

<P>She smiled. &quot;Perhaps you're right. You usually are.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's the virtue of being a man. Even if I'm wrong, I'm
right.&quot; He chuckled at the peculiar expression on her face.

<P>&quot;Now off with you -- and get that lunch basket
packed.&quot;

<P>She bowed. &quot;Yes, master. Your slave flies on winged feet
to execute your commands.&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled. Copper had been reading Old Doc's romances
again. He recognized the florid style.

<P>* * *

<P>Kennon landed the jeep in a mountain meadow halfway up the
slope of the peacefully slumbering volcano. It was quiet and
cool, and the light breeze was blowing Olympus's smoky cap away
from them to the west. Copper unpacked the lunch. She moved
slowly. After all, there was plenty of time, and she wasn't very
hungry. Neither was Kennon.

<P>&quot;Let's go for a walk,&quot; Copper said. &quot;The woods
look cool -- and maybe we can work up an appetite.&quot;

<P>&quot;Good idea. I could use some exercise. That lunch looks
big enough to choke a horse and I'd like to do it justice.&quot;

<P>They walked through the woods, skirting scant patches of
underbrush, slowly moving higher on the mountain slopes. The
trees, unlike those of Beta, did not end abruptly at a snow line,
but pushed green fingers upward through passages between old lava
flows, on whose black wrinkled surfaces nothing grew. The faint
hum of insects and the piping calls of the birdlike mammals added
to the impression of remoteness. It was hard to believe that
scarcely twenty kilometers from this primitive microcosm was the
border of the highly organized and productive farmlands of
Outworld Enterprises.

<P>&quot;Do you think we can see the hospital if we go high
enough?&quot; Copper said. She panted a little, unaccustomed to
the altitude.

<P>&quot;Possibly,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;It is a long distance
away. But we should be able to see Alexandria,&quot; he added.
&quot;That's high enough and big enough.&quot; He looked at her
curiously. &quot;How is it that you're so breathless?&quot; he
asked. &quot;We're not that high. You're getting fat with too
much soft living.&quot;

<P>Copper smiled. &quot;Perhaps I'm getting old.&quot;

<P>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Kennon chuckled. &quot;It's just fat.
Come to think of it you <I>are</I> plumper. Not that I mind, but
if you're going to keep that sylphlike figure you'd better go on
a diet.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're too good to me,&quot; Copper said.

<P>&quot;You're darn right I am. Well - let's get going. Exercise
is always good for the waistline, and I'd like to see what's up
ahead.&quot;

<P>Scarcely a kilometer ahead they came to a wall of lava that
barred their path. &quot;Oh, oh,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;We
can't go over<I> that</I>.&quot; He looked at the wrinkled and
shattered rock with its knifelike edges.

<P>&quot;I don't think my feet could take it,&quot; Copper
admitted.

<P>&quot;It looks like the end of the trail.&quot;

<P>&quot;No -- not quite,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;There seems to
be a path here.&quot; He pointed to a narrow cleft in the black
rock. &quot;Let's see where it goes.&quot;

<P>Copper hung back. &quot;I don't think I want to,&quot; she
said doubtfully. &quot;It looks awfully dark and narrow.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh, stop it. Nothing's going to hurt us. Come on.&quot;
Kennon took her hand.

<P>Unwillingly Copper allowed herself to be led forward.
&quot;There's something about this place that frightens me,&quot;
she said uncomfortably as the high black wails closed in,
narrowing until only a slit of yellow sky was visible overhead.
The path underfoot was surprisingly smooth and free from rocks,
but the narrow corridor, steeped in shadows, was gloomy and
depressingly silent. It even bothered Kennon, although he
wouldn't admit it. What forces had sliced this razor-thin cleft
in the dense rock around them? Earthquake probably. And if it
happened once it could happen again. He would hate to be trapped
here entombed in shattered rock.

<P>Gradually the passage widened, then abruptly it ended. A bleak
vista of volcanic ash dotted with sputter cones opened before
them. It was a flat tableland, roughly circular, scarcely half a
kilometer across, a desolation of black rock, stunted trees and
underbrush, and gray volcanic ash. A crater, somewhat larger than
the rest, lay with its nearest edge about two hundred meters
away. The rock edges were fire polished, gleaming in the yellow
sunshine, and the thin margin of trees and brush surrounding the
depression were gnarled and shrunken, twisted into fantastic
shapes.

<P>&quot;Hey! what's this?&quot; Kennon asked curiously.
&quot;That crater looks peculiar, like a meteor had struck here
-- but those stunted plants -- hmm -- there must have been some
radioactivity too.&quot; He looked at the crater speculatively.
&quot;Now I wonder----&quot;he began.

<P>Copper had turned a sickly white. &quot;No!&quot; she said in
a half-strangled voice--&quot;oh, <I>no</I>!'

<P>Kennon looked at her. &quot;You know what this is?&quot; he
demanded.

<P>&quot;No,&quot; Copper said. But her voice was unsteady.

<P>&quot;You're lying.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I <I>don't</I> know.&quot; Copper wailed. &quot;I'm
only guessing. I've never seen this place before in my life!
Please! -- let's get out of here!&quot;

<P>&quot;Then you know <I>about</I> this,&quot; Kennon demanded.

<P>&quot;I think it's the Pit,&quot; Copper said. 'The redes
don't say where it is. But the description fits -- the Circle of
Death, the Twisted Land -- it's all like the redes say.&quot;

<P>&quot;Redes? -- what are redes? And what is this business
about circles of death? There's something here that's peculiar
and I want to know what it is.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's nothing. Truly. Just let's go back. Let's leave
this place. It's no good. It's tabu.&quot;

<P>&quot;Tabu? You've never used that word before.&quot;

<P>&quot;Forbidden.&quot;

<P>&quot;Who forbids it?&quot;

<P>&quot;The Gods -- the Old Ones. It is not for Lani. Nor for
you.&quot; Her voice was harsh. &quot;Come away before it is too
late. Before the Silent Death strikes you down.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm going to have a look at this.&quot;

<P>&quot;You'll be killed!&quot; Copper said. &quot;And if you
die, I die too.&quot;

<P>&quot;Don't be foolish. There's nothing here that can hurt me.
See those trees and plants growing right up to the crater's edge.
If they can take it permanently, I can stand it for a few
moments. If there's any radioactivity there, it's not very
much.&quot;

<P>&quot;But the redes say---&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh, forget those redes. I know what I'm doing. Besides,
I'm a Betan and can stand more radiation than most men. A brief
exposure isn't going to hurt me.&quot;

<P>&quot;You go and I go too,&quot; Copper said desperately.

<P>''You'll stay here where it's safe,&quot; Kennon said flatly.

<P>&quot;I'm going with you,&quot; Copper repeated. &quot;I don't
want to live without you.&quot;

<P>&quot;I tell you I won't be hurt. And one quick look isn't
going to bother whatever's down there.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's what Roga the Foolish said when he opened Lyssa's
tower. But he brought men to Flora. And your little look may
bring an even greater calamity.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged, and started Walking toward the crater's edge.

<P>Copper followed.

<P>He turned to order her back, but the words died on his tips as
he saw the terror and determination on her face. Neither commands
nor pleas would move her. If he went she would follow. The only
way he could stop her would be with violence, and he didn't want
to manhandle her. He felt an odd mixture of pride, tenderness,
and admiration for her. Were their situations reversed, he
doubted whether he would have the courage she was showing. He
sighed. Perhaps she was right. Perhaps he did need an
antiradiation suit.

<P>&quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;You win. I'll get some
protective clothing and look at it later.&quot;

<P>Her knees sagged, but he caught her before she fell, and held
her erect until her strength returned. Belatedly he understood
the emotional strain that had been gripping her. &quot;If you
come back later, sir, you'll take me with you.&quot; The words
were a statement, not a question.

<P>He nodded. &quot;Providing you wear a radiation suit,&quot; he
said.

<P>She grimaced with distaste and he chuckled. Clothing and
Copper simply didn't get along together.

<P>&quot;Well?&quot;

<P>&quot;All right,&quot; she said unhappily.

<P>&quot;And there's one more condition.&quot;

<P>&quot;What's that?&quot; she asked suspiciously.

<P>&quot;That you tell me about this place. You obviously know
something about it, and with all your talking, you've never
mentioned it to me.&quot;

<P>&quot;It is forbidden to talk of these things to men,&quot;
Copper said -- and then, perversely, &quot;Do you want me to tell
you now?&quot;

<P>&quot;No -- it can wait. We have come a long way and I am
hungry. I listen poorly on an empty stomach. Let's go back to the
jeep and you can tell me later.&quot;

<P>Copper smiled. &quot;That's good,&quot; she said. &quot;I'd
feel better away from this place.&quot;

<P>CHAPTER XIII

<P>&quot;I was a poor learner of the redes,&quot; Copper
confessed. &quot;And I'll have to skip the Mysteries. I never
even tried to learn them. Somehow I was sure I'd never be a
preceptress.&quot; She settled herself more comfortably on the
tawny grass and watched him as he lay on his back beside her.

<P>&quot;Eh?&quot; Kennon said, &quot;Preceptress?&quot;

<P>&quot;The guardians of our traditions. They know the redes and
mysteries by heart.&quot;

<P>&quot;And you have kept your religion alive that way all these
years?&quot;

<P>&quot;It isn't exactly religion,&quot; Copper said. &quot;It's
more like history, we learn it to remember that we were once a
great race -- and that we may be again. Someday there will come a
male, a leader to bring us out of bondage, and our race will be
free of dependence on men. There will be pairings again, and
freedom to live as we please.&quot; She looked thoughtfully at
Kennon. &quot;You might even be the one -- even though you are
human. You're different from the others.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're prejudiced.&quot; Kennon smiled. &quot;I'm no
different. Well -- not very different at any rate.&quot;

<P>&quot;That is not my thought,&quot; Copper said. &quot;You are
very different indeed. No man has ever resisted a Lani as long as
you have.&quot;

<P>Kennon shook his head. &quot;Let's not go into that now. What
are these redes?&quot;

<P>&quot;I do not remember them all,&quot; Copper apologized.
&quot;I was----&quot;

<P>&quot;You've said that before. Tell me what you <I>do</I>
know.&quot;

<P>&quot;I remember the beginning fairly well,&quot; she said.
&quot;It goes back to the time before Flora when everything was
nothing and the Master Himself was lonely.&quot;

<P>Without warning her voice changed to a rhythmic, cadenced
chant that was almost a song. Her face became rapt and
introspective as she rocked slowly from side to side. The rhythm
was familiar and then he recognized it -- the unintelligible
music he had often heard coming from the barracks late at night
when no men were around -- the voiceless humming that the Lani
sang at work.

<P>First there was Darkness -- starless and sunless

<P>Void without form -- darker than night

<P>Then did the Master -- Lord of Creation

<P>Wave His right hand, saying, &quot;Let there be light!&quot;

<P>Verse, Kennon thought. That was logical. People remember
poetry better than prose. But the form was not what he'd normally
expect. It was advanced, a style that was past primitive blank
verse or heroic pentameter. He listened intently as Copper went
on.

<P>Light filled the heavens, bright golden glowing,

<P>Brought to the Void by His wondrous hand;

<P>Then did the Master -- Lord of Creation --

<P>Nod His great head, saying, &quot;Let there be land!&quot;

<P>Air, land, and water formed into being,

<P>Born in the sight of His all-seeing eyes;

<P>Then did the master -- Lord of Creation --

<P>Smile as He murmured, &quot;Let life arise!&quot;

<P>All of the life conceived by the Master,

<P>Varied in shape as the grasses and birds;

<P>Hunters and hunted, moveless and moving,

<P>Came into form at the sound of His words.

<P>&quot;That's a great deal like Genesis,&quot; Kennon said with
mild astonishment. &quot;Where could you have picked that
up?&quot;

<P>&quot;From the beginning of our race,&quot; Copper said.
&quot;It came to us with Ulf and Lyssa -- but what is
Genesis?&quot;

<P>&quot;A part of an ancient religion -- one that is still
followed on some of the Central Worlds. Its followers call
themselves Christians. They say it came from Earth, the
mother-world of men.&quot;

<P>&quot;Our faith has no name. We are children of Lyssa, who was
a daughter of the Master.&quot;

<P>&quot;It is an odd similarity,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;But
other races have had stories of the Creation. And possibly there
may be another explanation. Your ancestors could have picked this
up from Alexander's men. They came from Earth originally and some
of them could have been Christians.&quot;

<P>&quot;No,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;This rede is long before
Man Alexander. It is the origin of our world, even before Ulf and
Lyssa. It is the first Book -- the Book of the God-spell. Man
Alexander came in the sixth Book -- the Book of Roga.&quot;

<P>&quot;There's no point in arguing about it,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;Go on -- tell me the rest.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's going to be a long story,&quot; Copper said.
&quot;Even though I have forgotten some of it, I can chant the
redes for hours.&quot;

<P>Kennon braced his back against one of the fat tires of the
jeep. &quot;I'm a good listener,&quot; he said.

<P>She chuckled. &quot;You asked for this,&quot; she said -- and
took up the verses where she had left off. And Kennon learned the
Lani version of creation, of the first man and woman, cast out of
Heaven for loving each other despite the Master's objection, of
how they came to Flora and founded the race of the Lani. He
learned how the Lani grew in numbers and power, how they split
into two warring groups over the theological point of whether Ulf
or Lyssa was the principal deity, how Roga the Foolish opened
Lyssa's tower to find out whether the Ulfians or Lyssans were
right, and brought the Black Years to Flora.

<P>He heard the trial of Roga and the details of his torture by
the priests of Ulf and the priests of Lyssa -- united by this
greatest sacrilege. And he heard the Lani version of the landing
of Alexander's ship and man's conquest of Flora.

<P>It was a story of savagery and superstition, of blood and
intolerance, of bravery and cowardice, of love and beauty. Yet
through it all, even through the redes that described the
Conquest, there was a curious remoteness, a lack of emotion that
made the verses more terrible as they flowed in passionless
rhythm from Copper's lips.

<P>&quot;That's enough!&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;I told you you wouldn't like it.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's horrible. How can you remember such things?&quot;

<P>&quot;We begin to learn them as soon as we can talk. We know
the redes almost our entire lives.&quot; Copper was silent for a
moment. &quot;There's lots more,&quot; she said, &quot;but it's
all about our lives since the Man Alexander -- the old one --
took possession of us. And most of the newer redes are pretty
dull. Our life hasn't changed much since the men came. The Book
of Man is boring.&quot; Copper sighed. &quot;I have dared a great
deal by telling you these things. If the others knew, they would
kill both of us.&quot;

<P>&quot;Then why tell me?&quot; he asked.

<P>&quot;I love you,&quot; she said simply. &quot;You wanted to
know -- and I can deny you nothing.&quot;

<P>A wave of tenderness swept over him. She would give her life
for him -- and what would he give? Nothing. Not even his
prejudices. His face twisted. If she was only human, If she
wasn't just an animal. If he wasn't a Betan. If, if, if.
Resentment gorged his throat. It was unfair -- so damned unfair.
He had no business coming here. He should have stayed on Beta or
at least on a human world where he would never have met Copper.
He loved her, but he couldn't have her. It was Tantalus and
Sisyphus rolled into one unsightly package and fastened to his
soul. With a muttered curse he rose to his feet, and as he did he
stopped -- frozen - staring at Copper as though he had never seen
her before.

<P>&quot;<I>How</I> did you say that Roga was judged responsible
for Alexander coming here?&quot; he demanded.

<P>&quot;He went into Lyssa's tower -- where Ulf and Lyssa tried
to call Heaven -- and with his foolish meddling set the tower
alight with a glow that all could see. Less than a week later the
Man Alexander came.&quot;

<P>&quot;Where was this tower?&quot;

<P>&quot;Where Alexandria now stands. Man Alexander destroyed it
and built his house upon its ruins.&quot;

<P>&quot;And what was that place of the Pit?&quot;

<P>&quot;The Shrine of Ulf -- where the God-Egg struck Flora. It
is buried in the pit, but the Silent Death has protected it from
blasphemy -- and besides Man Alexander never learned about it. We
feared that he would destroy it as he did Lyssa's tower.&quot;

<P>A wild hope stirred in Kennon. &quot;We're going home,&quot;
he announced.

<P>&quot;Good.&quot;

<P>&quot;And we're going to get a pair of radiation suits -- and
then we're coming back. We'll have a good look at that Pit, and
if what's in there is what I think it is&quot; -- his face was a
mixture of grimness and eagerness -- &quot;we'll blow this whole
operation off this planet!&quot;

<P>Copper blanched. &quot;It is death to meddle with the
God-Egg,&quot; she said.

<P>&quot;Superstition!&quot; Kennon scoffed. &quot;If that Egg is
what I think, it was made by men, and you are their
descendant.&quot;

<P>&quot;Perhaps you're right, but I can't help thinking you are
wrong,&quot; she said soberly. &quot;Look at the trouble that
came with Roga's meddling. Be careful that you do not bring us a
worse fate.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll be very careful. We'll take every precaution.&quot;

<P>&quot;We?&quot;

<P>&quot;You're coming, of course. I can't imagine you staying
away.&quot;

<P>Copper nodded.

<P>&quot;You shouldn't worry so much&quot; Kennon teased.
&quot;You know we men live forever.&quot;

<P>&quot;That is true.&quot;

<P>&quot;And if I'm right you're just as human as I. And you're
capable of living as long as I do.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Copper said. Her voice was unconvinced,
her expression noncommittal.

<P>&quot;You females,&quot; Kennon said in quick exasperation.
&quot;You drive a man crazy. Get an idea in your head and it
takes triatomate to blast it out. Now let's go.&quot;

<P>Two hours brought them back to the volcanic area, and knowing
what to look for, Kennon located the pockmarked mountain valley.
From the air it looked completely ordinary. Kennon was amazed at
the perfection of the natural camouflage. The Pit was merely
another crater in the pitted ground. He dropped to a lower
altitude, barely a hundred feet above the sputter cones.
&quot;Look!&quot; he said.

<P>Below them was the crater of the Pit and in its center a
smooth bluish-black hemisphere protruded from the crater floor.
It would have passed unnoticed by the casual eye -- nearly
concealed by two gigantic blocks of pumice.

<P>&quot;The God-Egg!&quot; Copper exclaimed.

<P>&quot;Egg -- ha! that's a spacer! I thought it would be. I'd
recognize durilium anywhere. Let's go down and look this over,
but first we want a couple of pictures.&quot; He pointed a camera
at the crater and snapped the shutter. &quot;There -- now let's
have a closer look at our baby.&quot;

<P>&quot;Do you expect me to get into that thing?&quot; Copper
said distastefully as she prodded the shapeless green coveralls
with a bare toe. She eyed the helmet, gloves and boots with equal
distaste. &quot;I'd suffocate.&quot;

<P>&quot;If you want to come with me, you'll wear it,&quot;
Kennon said. &quot;Otherwise you won't come near that pit. Try it
and I'll chain you to the jeep.&quot;

<P>&quot;You wouldn't!&quot;

<P>&quot;Just try me.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh -- all fight. I'll wear the thing -- but I won't be
comfortable.''

<P>&quot;Who cares about that? You'll be protected.&quot;

<P>&quot;All right -- show me how to put it on. I'd rather be
with you than worry about what you are doing.&quot;

<P>The suit was several sizes too large but it covered her
adequately. Too adequately, Kennon decided. She looked like a
pile of wrinkles with legs. He chuckled.

<P>She glared. &quot;So I'm funny,&quot; she said. &quot;Let me
tell you something else that's funny. I'm hot. I'm sweating. I
itch. Now -- laugh!&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't feel like laughing,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I
feel the same way.&quot;

<P>They approached the edge of the Pit carefully. Kennon kept
checking tho radiation counter. The needle slowly rose and
steadied at one-half roentgen per hour as he thrust the probe
over the rim of the depression. &quot;It's fine, so far,&quot; he
said encouragingly. &quot;We could take this much for quite a
while even without suits.&quot; He lowered himself over the edge,
sliding down the gentle slope.

<P>&quot;How is it down there?&quot; Copper called. The intercom
crackled in his ear.

<P>&quot;Fine -- barely over one roentgen per hour. With these
suits we could stay here indefinitely.&quot; The sigh of relief
was music in her ears. &quot;This place is barely lukewarm.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's what you think,&quot; Copper said.

<P>&quot;I mean radiation warm,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Stay up
there and watch me. I may need some things.&quot;

<P>&quot;All right.&quot; Copper squirmed inside the hot suit.
The thing was an oven. She hoped that Kennon didn't plan to work
in the daytime. It would be impossible.

<P>Kennon gingerly approached the ship. It was half buried in the
loose debris and ash that had fallen or blown into the pit during
the centuries it had rested there. It was old -- incredibly old.
The hull design was ancient -- riveted sheets of millimeter-thick
durilium. Ships hadn't been built like that in over two thousand
years. And the ovoid shape was reminiscent of the even more
ancient spindizzy design. A hyperspace converter like that
couldn't be less than four millennia old. It was a museum piece,
but the blue-black hull was as smooth and unblemished as the day
it had left fabrication.

<P>Space travel would have gotten nowhere without durilium,
Kennon reflected. For five thousand years men had used the
incredibly tough synthetic to build their spacecraft. It had
given man his empire. Kennon gave the hull one quick glance. That
part of the ship didn't worry him. It was what he would find
inside that bothered him. How much damage had occurred from two
thousand or more years of disuse? How much had the original
travelers cannibalized? How much could be salvaged? What sort of
records remained? There were a thousand questions that the
interior of that enigmatic hull might answer.

<P>The upper segment of the airlock was visible. It was closed,
which was a good sign. A few hours' work with a digger should
expose it enough to be opened.

<P>&quot;Copper,&quot; he said, &quot;we're going to have to dig
this out. There's a small excavator in the cargo bed of the jeep.
Do you think you can bring it down here?&quot;

<P>&quot;I think so.&quot;

<P>&quot;Good girl!&quot; Kennon turned back to the ship. He was
eager to enter it. There might be things inside that would settle
the question of the Lani. The original crew had probably
recognized the value of the hull as a repository as well as he
did. But in the meantime there would be work -- lots of it. And
every step must be recorded.

<P>It was the rest of the day's work to expose the emergency
airlock. The little excavator toiled over the loose ash for hours
before it displaced enough to make the port visible, and the ash
was not yet cleared away sufficiently to open the portal when
darkness brought a halt to the work.

<P>It would be impossible to unearth the spaceship with their
low-capacity digger, Kennon decided. It would be difficult enough
to clear the emergency airlock in the nose. But if the tubes and
drive were still all right, by careful handling it should be
possible to use the drive to blast out the loose ash and cinders
which surrounded the hull.

<P>Kennon reluctantly gave up the idea of entering the spaceship.
That would have to wait until tomorrow. Now they would have to
conceal the work and call it a day. A few branches and the big
blocks of pumice would suffice for temporary camouflage. Later
they could make something better. Anything in the jeep which
might be useful was cached along with the radiation suits in the
passageway through the lava wall -- and in a surprisingly short
time they were heading homeward.

<P>Kennon was not too displeased. Tomorrow they would be able to
enter the ship. Tomorrow they would probably have some of the
answers to his questions. He looked ahead into the gathering
night. The gray mass of the abandoned Olympus Station slipped
below them as he lined the jeep along the path indicated by the
luminous arrow atop the main building, set the controls on
automatic, and locked the craft on the guide beacon in
Alexandria's tower. In a little less than an hour they would be
home.

<P>CHAPTER XIV

<P>Kennon was morally certain that the Lani were of human stock.
Evolved, of course. Mutated. Genetic strangers to the rest of
humanity. But human. The spaceship and the redes proved it as far
as he was concerned. But moral certainty and legal certainty were
two different things. What he believed might be good enough to
hold up in a Brotherhood court, but he doubted it. Ulf and Lyssa
might be the founders of the Lani race, but they had come to
Kardon nearly four thousand years ago and no records existed to
prove that the Lani weren't here before they came. Redes passed
by word of mouth through hundreds of generations were not
evidence. Even the spaceship wasn't the absolute proof that would
be needed to overturn the earlier legal decision. Other and
better proof was needed -- something that would stand up in any
court in the Brotherhood. He hoped the spaceship would hold that
proof.

<P>But Kennon's eagerness to find out what was inside the ancient
spacer was tempered by hard practicality. Too much depended on
what he might find inside that hull. Every step of the work must
be documented beyond any refutation. Some method of establishing
date, time, and location had to be prepared. There must be a
record of every action. And that would require equipment and
planning. There must be no mistake that could be twisted by the
skillful counsel that Alexander undoubtedly retained.

<P>He had no doubt that the Family would fight. Too much money
and prestige were involved. To prove the Lani human would destroy
Outworld Enterprises on Kardon. Yet this thought did not bother
him. To his surprise he had no qualms of conscience. He was
perfectly willing to violate his contract, break faith with his
employers, and plot their ruin. The higher duty came first -- the
duty to the human race.

<P>He smiled wryly. It wasn't all higher duty. There were some
personal desires that leavened the nobility. To prove Copper
human was enough motivation -- actually it was better than his
sense of duty. Events, Kennon reflected, cause a great deal of
change in one's attitude. Although not by nature a plotter,
schemes had been flitting through his mind with machinelike
regularity, to be examined and discarded, or to be set aside for
future reference.

<P>He rejected the direct approach. It was too dangerous,
depended too much on personalities, and had too little chance for
success. He considered the possibility of letters to the
Brotherhood Council but ultimately rejected it. Not only was the
proof legally insufficient to establish humanity in the Lani, but
he also remembered Alexander's incredible knowledge of his
activities, and there was no reason to suppose that his present
didn't receive the same scrutiny as the past. And if he, who
hadn't written a letter in over a year, suddenly began to write,
the correspondence would undoubtedly be regarded with suspicion
and would probably be examined, and Dirac messages would be out
for the same reason.

<P>He could take a vacation and while he was away from the island
he could inform the Brotherhood. Leaving Flora wouldn't be
particularly difficult, but leaving Kardon would be virtually
impossible. His contract called for vacations, but it expressly
provided that they would be taken on Kardon. And again, there
would be no assurance that his activities would not be watched.
In fact, it was probable that they would be.

<P>There was nothing that could be done immediately. But there
were certain long-range measures that could be started. He could
begin preparing a case that could be presented to the Council.
And Beta, when it knew, would help him. The situation of the Lani
was so close to Beta's own that its obvious merit as a test case
simply could not be ignored. If he could get the evidence to
Beta, it would be easy to enlist the aid of the entire
Medico-Technological Civilization. It would take time and
attention to detail; the case, the evidence, everything would
have to be prepared with every safeguard and contingency
provided, so that there would not be the slightest chance of a
slip-up once it came to court.

<P>And perhaps the best method of bringing the evidence would be
to transport it under its own power. The thought intrigued him.
Actually it wouldn't be too difficult. Externally the Egg wasn't
in bad shape. The virtually indestructible durilium hull was
still intact. The controls and the engines, hermetically sealed
inside the hull, were probably as good as the day they stopped
running. The circuitry would undoubtedly be bad but it could be
repaired and restored, and new fuel slugs could be obtained for
the engine and the converter. But that was a problem for the
future.

<P>The immediate problem was to get into the ship in a properly
documented fashion.

<P>It took nearly two months, but finally, under the impersonal
lenses of cameras and recorders, the entrance port of the God-Egg
swung open and revealed the dark interior. Kennon moved
carefully, recording every step as he entered the black orifice
in the spaceship's side. His handtorch gave plenty of light for
the recorders as he moved inside - Copper at his heels, both of
them physically unrecognizable in antiradiation suits.

<P>&quot;Why are we moving so slowly?&quot; Copper said.
&quot;Let's go ahead and find out what's beyond this
passageway.&quot;

<P>&quot;From a superstitious coward you've certainly become a
reckless explorer,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;The Egg hasn't hurt us, and we've been around it many
times,&quot; she said. &quot;Either the curse has become too old
to hurt us, or there never was any in the first place. So let's
see what is ahead. I'm curious.&quot;

<P>Kennon shook his head. &quot;In this business we must hurry
slowly -- very slowly. You know why.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I want to see.&quot;

<P>&quot;Patience, girl. Simmer down. You'll see soon
enough,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Now help me set up this
camera.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh, all right -- but isn't there any excitement in
you?&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm bubbling over with it,&quot; Kennon admitted,
&quot;but I manage to keep it under control.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're cold-blooded.&quot;

<P>&quot;No -- I'm sensible. We want to nail this down. My
future, yours, and that of your people depend upon how carefully
we work. You wouldn't want to let us all down by being too eager,
would you?&quot;

<P>She shook her head. &quot;No -- you're right of course. But I
still would like to see.&quot;

<P>They moved cautiously through the airlock and into the control
room.

<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; Kennon said with satisfaction. &quot;I hoped
for this, but I didn't dare expect it.&quot;

<P>&quot;What?&quot;

<P>&quot;Look around. What do you see?&quot;

<P>&quot;Nothing but an empty room. It's shaped like half an
orange, and it has a lot of funny instruments and dials on the
walls, and a video screen overhead. But that's all. Why -- what's
so unusual about it? It looks just like someone had left
it.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's the point. There's nothing essential that's
missing. They didn't cannibalize the instruments -- and they
didn't come back.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;

<P>&quot;Maybe because that curse you mentioned a few minutes ago
was real.&quot;

<P>Copper drew back. &quot;But you said it wouldn't hurt
us----&quot;

<P>&quot;Not now. The heat's practically gone, but when whoever
flew this crate came here, the whole shell could have been as hot
as a Samarian summer.&quot;

<P>&quot;But couldn't they have come back when it cooled?&quot;

<P>&quot;Not with this kind of heat. The hull was probably too
radioactive to approach from the outside. And radioactivity cools
off slowly. It might take several lifetimes for its level to
become low enough to approach if there was no decontamination
equipment available.&quot;

<P>&quot;I suppose that's why the early ones thought the Egg was
cursed.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded. &quot;Now let's check -- oh! oh! what's
this?&quot; He pointed to a metal-backed book lying on the
control panel.

<P>&quot;It looks like a book,&quot; Copper said.

<P>&quot;I'm hoping it's <I>the</I> book.&quot;

<P>&quot;The book?&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes -- the ship's log. It's possible. And if it is, we
may have all the evidence we need -- Copper! -- <I>Don't touch
it!</I>&quot;

<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;

<P>&quot;Because its position has to be recorded first. Wait
until we get the camera and recorders set up.&quot;

<P>* * *

<P>Gingerly Kennon opened the ancient book. The sheets inside
were brittle -- crumbling with age -- but he could make out the
title <I>U.N.S.S. Wanderer</I> with the date of launching and a
lower line which read &quot;Ship's Log.&quot; Kennon was thankful
for his medical training. The four years of Classical English
that he had despised so much were essential now. Stumbling over
unfamiliar words and phrases, he moved slowly through the log
tracing the old ship's history from .pleasure craft to short-haul
freight tractor to obsolescence m a space dump orbiting around a
world called Heaven.

<P>There was a gap of nearly ten years indicated by a blank page
before the entries resumed.

<P>&quot;Ah -- this is it!&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; Copper said curiously. &quot;I can't
read the writing.&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course you can't. It's in English -- a language that
became obsolete during the Interregnum. I  had to learn it, since
most medical terminology is based on it.&quot;

<P>&quot;What is an Interregnum?&quot; Copper interrupted. I've
never heard that word before.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's a period of confusion when there is no stable
government. The last one came after the Second Galactic War --
but never mind that -- it happened long ago and isn't important
now. The important thing that did happen was the Exodus.&quot;

<P>&quot;What was that?&quot;

<P>&quot;A religious revival and a tremendous desire to see what
was happening beyond the next star. During that century men
traveled wider and farther then they ever have before or since.
In that outward explosion with its mixed motivations of religion
and practicality, colonists and missionaries went starward to
find new worlds to tame, and new races to be rescued from the
darkness of idolatry and hell. Almost any sort of vehicle capable
of mounting a spindizzy converter was pressed into service. The
old spindizzies were soundly engineered converters of almost
childlike simplicity that could and did carry ships enormous
distances if their passengers didn't care about subjective
time-lag, and a little radioactivity.

<P>&quot;And that's what happened to this ship. According to this
log it was bought by Alfred and Melissa Weygand - a missionary
couple with the idea of spreading the Christian faith to the
heathen.

<P>&quot;Alfred and Melissa -- Ulf and Lyssa -- they were a part
of this ancient explosion that scattered human seed across
parsecs of interstellar space. It seems that they were a unit in
a missionary fleet that had gone out to the stars with flame in
their hearts and Gospel on their lips to bring the Word to the
benighted heathen on other worlds.&quot; Kennon's lips curled
with mild contempt at their stupid foolhardiness even as his
pulse quickened to their bravery. They had been fanatics, true
enough, but theirs was a selfless fanaticism that would risk
torture and death for what they believed -- a fanaticism that was
more sublime than the concept of Brotherhood which had evolved
from it. They knew nothing of the enmity of race, of the
incessant struggle man had since waged with alien intelligences
all too willing to destroy intruders who encroached upon their
worlds. Mankind's early selflessness had long ago been discarded
for frank expansionism and dominance over the lesser races that
stood in their way. And in a way it was too bad.

<P>The ship's log, meticulously kept in neat round English
script, told a story that was more than the bare bones of flight.
There was passion and tenderness and a spiritual quality that was
shocking to a modern man steeped in millennia of conquest and
self-interest. There was a greatness to it, a depth of faith that
had since been lost. And as Kennon slowly deciphered the ancient
script he admired the courage even as his mind winced with dismay
at the unheeding recklessness.

<P>The Weygands had lost contact with the others, and had
searched for them in hyperspace, doubling and twisting upon their
course until they had become hopelessly lost, and then, with
their fuel nearly exhausted, had broken out into the normal
three-space continuum to find Kardon's sun and the world they
called Flora.

<P>How little they had known and how lucky they had been.

<P>It was only by the grace of their God that they had found this
world before their fuel was exhausted. And it was only by further
grace that the planet was habitable and not populated with
intelligent life. They had more luck than people were entitled to
in a dozen lifetimes. Against odds of a million to one they had
survived.

<P>It was fascinating reading.

<P>But it was not proof.

<P>The last entry read: &quot;We have circled this world and have
seen no buildings -- no sign of intelligent life. We are lost,
marooned on this empty world. Our fuel supplies are too low for
us to attempt to find the others. Nor could we. The
constellations in the sky are strange. We do not know which way
to go. Therefore we shall land upon the great island in the
center of the yellow sea. And perhaps someday men will come to us
since we cannot return to them. Melissa thinks that this is an
example of Divine Providence, that the Lord's mercy has been
shown to us that were lost in the vastness of the deep -- that we
have been chosen, like Eve and Adam, to spread the seed of man to
yet another world. I hope she is right, yet I fear the radiation
level of the ship has become inordinately high. We may well be
Eve and Adam, yet an Adam that cannot beget and an Eve that is
not fruitful. I am trimming the ship for landing, and we shall
leave it immediately after we have landed, taking with us only
what we absolutely need. There is too much radiation from the
spindizzy and the drive to remain here longer -- and God knows
how hot the outer hull may be.&quot;

<P>And that was all. Presumptive evidence -- yes. Reasonable
certainty -- yes. But not proof. Lawyers could argue that since
no direct exploration was made there was no valid reason to
assume that the Lani did not already inhabit Kardon. But Kennon
knew. His body, more perceptive than his mind, had realized a
truth that his brain would not accept until he read the log. It
was at once joy and frustration. Joy that Copper was human,
frustration that he could not obtain for her and her race the
rights to which they were entitled. But the immediate problem was
solved. His conditioning was broken now he was convinced that
Copper was a member of the human race. It was no violation of his
code to love her. The greatest barrier was broken, and with it
gone the lesser ones would yield. Relief that was almost pain
washed through him and left him weak with reaction.

<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; Copper asked as he turned to her.
&quot;What is this thing that has turned your face to joy?&quot;

<P>&quot;Can't you guess?&quot;

<P>She shook her head. &quot;I have seen nothing but you reading
this ancient book, yet you turn to me with the look in your eyes
that the redes say Ulf had for Lyssa.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're human!&quot;

<P>Copper shrugged. &quot;You're mad. I'm a Lani. I was born a
Lani -- and I shall die one.&quot;

<P>&quot;Don't you understand? All Lani are human. You all are
the descendants of two humans who came here thousands of years
ago.&quot;

<P>&quot;Then there is no reason why you cannot love me.&quot;

<P>Kennon shook his head. &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;There is
no reason.&quot;

<P>Copper laughed. It was a sound so merry and gay that Kennon
looked at her in surprise. She looked as happy as she sounded.

<P>Simple and savage, Kennon thought. She cared nothing for the
future, and probably very little about the injustice of her
present. The thing that mattered was that what had kept them
apart was gone. She was probably offering mental sacrifices to
the Old Ones who had caused this change in the man she loved. She
didn't really care about what had caused the change. To her it
was sufficient that it had happened.

<P>For a moment Kennon wished that it could be as simple for him
as it apparently was for her. The fact that Copper was human
posed a greater problem than the one it solved. The one had been
personal. The other was infinitely greater. He could not let it
lie. The very morality which had kept him from doing what he
wished when he thought she was a humanoid now forced him to do
what he did not wish. Every instinct said to leave it alone. The
problem was too great for one man to solve, the situation too
complicated, the evidence too inconclusive, the opposition too
powerful. It would be far better to take his happiness and enjoy
it. It was not his problem to solve. He could turn the evidence
over to the Brotherhood once his contract was over, and better
and more capable people than he could settle the Lani legal
status. But the inner voice that had called him bestial now
called him shirker, coward, and slacker. And this, too, could not
be borne. The case of the Lani would have to be pursued as
vigorously as he could do it. They were entitled to human rights
-- whether they wanted them or not.

<P>His first idea of making the spacer operational was a good
one, Kennon decided as they finished the inspection of the ship.
Even if it was never used it would make a good means of retreat.
He grinned wryly. In a guerrilla operation such as the one he was
considering it would be wise to have a way out if things got too
hot. The heavy parts, the engines and the controls, were in
workable condition and would merely require cleaning and oiling.
Some of the optical equipment would have to be replaced and fuel
slugs would have to be obtained for the drive -- but none of
these would be too hard to accomplish. The slugs from any of the
power reactors on the island would serve nicely. All that would
have to be done would be to modify the fuel ports on the ship's
engine. The spindizzy would have to be disassembled and checked,
and the main leads, embedded in time-resistant plastic, would
have to be examined. The most serious problem, however, wouldn't
involve these things. The control board wiring and circuitry was
where the trouble would lie. Normal insulation and printed
circuitry wasn't designed to last for thousands of years. Each
wired circuit would have to be removed, duplicated, and replaced.
Every printed panel would have to be cleaned and receive a new
coat of insulating varnish. Working full time, a four-man
electronics team could do the job in a week. Working part-time
the two of them might get it done in three months. And the other
jobs would take at least another. Add a month for errors in
judgment, lack of materials, and mistakes -- and another for
unavoidable delays -- it would be at least six months before the
Egg would be spaceworthy.

<P>Six months.

<P>Not too long if everything went well, but far too long if
there were any mistakes. He would have to be careful, yet he must
not give the impression of being careful. He shook his head.
Being a subversive was going to require a greater amount of
acting ability than he had ever been called upon to display.

<P>And what of Copper? How would she behave under the double
strain of knowledge that she was human and knowledge of the
spaceship? Women weren't noted for their tight-lipped reticence.
Would she tell the other Lani? Would she crack under the
pressure? Did she have the qualities of a good conspirator?

<P>As it turned out, he didn't need to worry. As a partner in
crime, Copper was all that could be wished. Everything was
normal. She was still obedient, helpful, and gay as ever. To
watch her, no one would ever think that her bright head was full
of knowledge that could rock Flora to its foundations. Never by
look or word did she betray the slightest trace of strain or
guilt.

<P>And in her other moments she was ecstatic in her love and
helpful with the repair work on the Egg whenever Kennon could get
time to visit the old spaceship.

<P>&quot;You amaze me,&quot; Kennon said as they eased the cover
of the spindizzy in place and spun the bolts on the lugs that
held it to the outer shielding. He picked up a heavy wrench and
began methodically to seat the bolts as Copper wiped the white
extrusion of the cover sealant from the shining case.

<P>&quot;How?&quot;

<P>&quot;The way you hide your knowledge of this ship from the
others. I know you better than anyone else on this island, and
yet you would fool me.&quot;

<P>&quot;We Lani are used to hiding things. You men have been our
masters for centuries, yet you do not know our redes. Nor do you
know what we think, We obey you, but there are parts of us you do
not own. It is easy to hide a little thing like this.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded. It figured. He seated another bolt. Three more
and the drive room would be restored and they could start on the
control circuits. &quot;I wish you were as clever about adopting
human customs as you are about hiding guilty knowledge,&quot; he
said.

<P>Copper laughed. &quot;You mean those silly things you have
been teaching me? Why should I learn them? I'm happy as I am. I
love you, you love me, and that is all that matters.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's not all that matters. Can't you get it through your
head that civilized customs are necessary in a civilized
society?&quot; He gave the next-to-last bolt an extra-vicious
wrench. &quot;You'll have to know them if you expect to get along
on Beta.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I will never see Beta.&quot;

<P>&quot;I am going there when my duty here is over. And you're
going with me.&quot;

<P>&quot;When will that be?&quot;

<P>&quot;Three years.&quot;

<P>&quot;So long? Well -- we can think of it then, but I don't
think Man Alexander will let you take me.&quot;

<P>&quot;Then I shall take you without his consent&quot;

<P>She smiled. &quot;It would be easier to stay here. In another
fifteen years I will be old and you will not want me.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll never do that. I'll always want you.&quot;

<P>&quot;You swear too easily,&quot; she said gently. &quot;You
men live forever. We Lani are a short-lived race.&quot;

<P>&quot;But you needn't be. It's obviously----&quot;

<P>&quot;It's been tried, my love -- and those who were treated
died. Man Alexander tried many years ago to make us long-lived
like you. But he failed. You see, he loved one of us too.&quot;

<P>&quot;But----&quot;

<P>&quot;Let us think no more of it. Let us enjoy what we have
and be grateful to the Gods for the love we enjoy -- or do you
have any Gods?&quot;

<P>&quot;One.&quot;

<P>&quot;Two are better. More, anyway. And besides, Ulf and Lyssa
and the God-Egg are responsible for our joy.&quot;

<P>&quot;They are indeed,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;Then why should you think of leaving the place where
they rule? You should stay here. There will be other Lani when I
am gone. You will be happy always.&quot;

<P>&quot;Not without you,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Don't you
understand that I love you?&quot;

<P>&quot;And I you. But I am a Lani. You are a man.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're as human as I am,&quot; Kennon said abruptly.

<P>&quot;That is what you say,&quot; Copper replied. &quot;I am
not so sure. I need more proof than this.&quot; She waved her
hand at the ship.

<P>&quot;What proof do you need?&quot;

<P>&quot;The same as the proof you men require. If I should have
your child, then I would believe that I was human.&quot;

<P>&quot;I've told you a thousand times that the radiation on
this ship must have affected Ulf and Lyssa's germ plasm. Can't
you understand that?&quot;

<P>&quot;I can understand it all right, but it does not change
things. Ulf and Lyssa may have been human before they came here,
but they were not when they landed. They were Lani, and their
children were Lani.&quot;

<P>&quot;But they were of human stock.&quot;

<P>&quot;The law that lets men become our masters does not agree
with you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Then the law is wrong. It should be changed.&quot;

<P>Copper shrugged. &quot;Two people cannot change a law.&quot;

<P>&quot;They can try -- particularly if the law is unjust.&quot;

<P>Copper sighed. &quot;Is it not enough for us to love? Must you
try to run through a wall?&quot;

<P>&quot;When the wall stands in the way of right and justice I
must.&quot;

<P>Copper looked at him with pity in her green eyes. &quot;This I
do not understand. I know nothing of right and justice. What are
these things? Just words. Yet you will endanger our happiness for
them. If it is my happiness you wish - then leave this
foolishness alone. I have fifteen years I can live with you
before I am old and you tire of me. With those years I can be
content.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I can't,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Call me selfish if
you wish, but I want you with me as long as I live. I don't want
to live my life without you.&quot;

<P>&quot;You want too much,&quot; Copper said softly. &quot;But
if it makes you happy to try to get it, I shall help. And if we
do not succeed you will at least be happier for trying. And if
you are happy&quot; -- she shrugged -- &quot;then the rest makes
little difference.&quot;

<P>That was the crux of the matter, Kennon reflected bitterly. He
was convinced she was human. She was not. And until her mind
could be changed on that point she would help him but her heart
wouldn't be in it. And the only thing that would convince her
that she was human would be a child - a child of his begetting.
He could perhaps trick her with an artificial insemination of
Lani sperm. There were drugs that could suspend consciousness,
hypnotics that would make her believe anything she was told while
under their influence.

<P>But in the end it would do no good. All witnesses in
Brotherhood court actions were examined under psychoprobe, and a
hypnotic was of no value against a lie detector that could
extract the deepest buried truth. And he would be examined too.
The truth would out--and nothing would be gained. In fact --
everything would be lost. The attempt at trickery would prejudice
any court against the honest evidence they had so painfully
collected.

<P>He sighed. The only thing to do was to go on as they were --
and hope that the evidence would hold. With Betan legal talent at
their back it might. And, of course, they could try to produce a
child as nature had intended. They could try -- but Kennon knew
it would not succeed. It never had.

<P>CHAPTER XV

<P>Copper had been acting strangely of late, Kennon thought as he
rolled over in his bed and watched her standing before the
full-length mirror on the bathroom door. She pivoted slowly
before the glass, eying herself critically, raising her arms over
her head, holding them at her sides, flexing her supple spine and
tightening muscles that moved like silken cords beneath her
golden skin.

<P>&quot;What are you trying to do -- become a muscle
dancer?&quot; Kennon asked idly.

<P>She whirled, a crimson blush deepening the tan of her face.
&quot;You were supposed to be asleep,&quot; she said.

<P>&quot;I'm an unregenerate heel,&quot; he replied, &quot;and I
don't sleep too well nowadays unless you're beside me.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well -- I suppose you might as well know now as
later,&quot; she said. &quot;You'll know in any event.&quot;

<P>&quot;Know what?&quot;

<P>&quot;That you're right. I am human.&quot;

<P>&quot;And what brought on this sudden change of--&quot; He
stopped abruptly, his eyes widening.

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Copper said. &quot;I am with child. Your
child.&quot;

<P>&quot;But that's impossible.&quot;

<P>She shook her head. &quot;It's a miracle perhaps, but it's not
impossible. It's happened. Can't you see the difference?&quot;

<P>&quot;See what? You look just as you always do.&quot;

<P>&quot;I suppose you can't see it yet,&quot; she admitted.
&quot;But I am with child. I'm two weeks past my time.&quot;

<P>Kennon's mind leaped to the obvious conclusion.
Pseudo-pregnancy. He had seen it before among Lani at Hillside
Farm. It was an odd syndrome which occasionally occurred in
humans and animals. The brain, desiring children, made demands
upon the body and the body responded to its desire by tricking
the brain. Lani were fairly subject to its probably because they
had better imaginations. He would run a few tests when they went
down to the hospital, and once she realized the practical joke
her body was playing everything would be all right. No wonder she
seemed excited.

<P>&quot;We'll find out about that later,&quot; he said equably.
&quot;We'll settle this when we get back to the hospital.&quot;

<P>Copper smiled confidently and patted her stomach. &quot;I know
what you are thinking, but you're wrong. We Lani know about these
things. In forty generations I am the first to conceive as the
Master intended.&quot;

<P>&quot;I hope you haven't,&quot; Kennon said with such bitter
sincerity that Copper looked at him wide-eyed. &quot;Not now.
Because if you have, neither your life nor mine is safe.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;

<P>&quot;The Alexanders. Do you think they'll take it lying down?
We're not ready for them yet. They'll fight, and the first thing
they'll do is kill you and erase me so we would never be able to
talk. You have been declared an animal, and you will not be
allowed to change.&quot;

<P>&quot;What can we do?&quot; Copper asked. She shivered.
&quot;I do not want to die.&quot;

<P>&quot;Nor do I want you to,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;I could tell the others.&quot;

<P>&quot;And just what would that accomplish?&quot;

<P>&quot;In a week every Lani on the island would know it. There
would be revolt. For the Lani would no longer be dependent upon
Men to survive. Their greatest hold on us would be gone. And we
would be free again on our island world.&quot;

<P>&quot;You would <I>not!</I>&quot; Kennon said. &quot;That sort
of thinking is foolishness. Alexander would have men here within
a week, and a week after that you would be smashed. Don't you
realize that there are thousands of millions of men in the galaxy
-- and to every one of them you would be animals. You know
nothing about what you would face. Your puny hundreds couldn't
even stand against a fraction of the power Alexander could mount
against you. Have you seen a Burkholtz blaster work? Have you
seen remote-control antipersonnel missiles? Have you push-pull
projectors, atomic warheads? All of these weapons Alexander can
command. Don't you realize he's an entrepreneur? -- one of the
most powerful men in this sector?&quot;

<P>Copper shook her head. &quot;No,&quot; she said in a small
voice. &quot;I know nothing about these things.&quot;

<P>&quot;And do you think forty generations of absolute obedience
to men can be overcome because one Lani says she is pregnant by a
man?&quot;

<P>Copper frowned. &quot;You put that in a different way. You
talk as if it were my belief rather than the truth.&quot;

<P>&quot;What is truth?&quot; Kennon said heavily. &quot;Who
would believe you? There are hundreds of others with child.

<P>&quot;Sure you're human. You know it. I know it. I've been
trying to convince you for the past two months. You're just as
human as I am. But pray that you're not pregnant. We can't get
out of here in less than four months and by then everybody will
know about you. Someone will certainly check the records. And
after that will come the psychoprobes. Everything will come to
light. The Egg will be destroyed. I will be erased. You will be
dead. And that will be the end of it.&quot; He looked down at her
with an odd expression of pity on his face. &quot;You see?&quot;
he demanded harshly.

<P>Copper nodded. &quot;I didn't understand,&quot; she said.
&quot;Don't be angry with me. I shouldn't have told you. I
thought you'd be happy.&quot;

<P>&quot;I was never angry with you, but I am with myself. I was
stupid. I didn't figure on the remote possibility that we might
be genetically compatible. I should have my head examined for
putting you in such danger. However there's the possibility --
the probability -- that your body is playing a trick upon
you.&quot;

<P>She shook her head. &quot;You are wrong. I am not mistaken. I
am with child and the child is yours. But the fault is no more
yours than mine. I wanted you before you looked on me. I still do
and I do not feel at fault. That I am yours, that my child is
yours is a thing of wonder and joy. Never could I have expected
so much.&quot;

<P>Kennon looked down at her smudged face, streaked with the
sudden rivulets of tears, and bitterness galled his throat. Dear
God -- let her be wrong, he prayed silently. Let it be
pseudopregnancy this time. Let the tests be negative.

<P>But they weren't. Unequivocally they confirmed Copper's
diagnosis. Here was the proof he needed. The final test that
would prove the Lani human. And he had no way of getting it where
it would do any good. It would take at least four months of
steady labor before the ship was ready, and he didn't have that
sort of time. He was needed here and his prolonged absence would
cause suspicion and investigation. Something would have to be
done -- but what? He couldn't take Copper off the island in an
airboat. They were checked with microscopic care by Otpen One's
IFF. A jeep didn't have enough range to take them to the
mainland. And even if they got there they couldn't get off the
planet. Alexander knew everything that happened on Kardon's two
spaceports. The Egg was the only way, but the Egg was unfinished
and unspaceworthy.

<P>Frantically Kennon considered concealing Copper. He shook his
head. It wouldn't work. It would be impossible, to hide a baby on
a place where every birth was recorded. Nor could one hide
evidence of pregnancy in a Lani. Childbearing leaves telltale
marks upon the body, and Copper, even if she could be concealed
for the duration of her pregnancy, could never survive the
sharp-eyed scrutiny of her fellows or the other humans. Questions
would inevitably be asked.

<P>There had to be a solution. He rubbed his forehead wearily. It
was strange how so little a thing as the union of a spermatozoon
and an ovum could produce so much trouble. He looked across the
office at Copper placidly filing case cards. She wasn't worrying.
With sublime faith, she was sure that he would find the answer,
the one that would solve everything. He shuddered. The only
logical solution was abortion -- and that was unthinkable! He
would not murder his child -- nor would Copper permit it if he
was capable of doing so.

<P>It was almost a relief when his phone rang and Blalok's voice
came cheerfully across the wire.

<P>&quot;Tried to get you about an hour ago,&quot; the
superintendent said, &quot;but your girl said you were
busy.&quot;

<P>&quot;I was.&quot;

<P>&quot;You through now?&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well, get up to the fortress. Alexander just flew in and
he's calling a meeting. Something important has come up.&quot;

<P>Something important! A wave of ice rattled down Kennon's
spine, and then he grinned feebly. Alexander didn't know. He
couldn't know. It had to be something else.

<P>&quot;I'll be right up,&quot; he said, marveling at the
calmness in his voice.

<P>Kennon couldn't help comparing this meeting with the one a
year ago. The location was different -- the conference room in
Alexandria was more formal than Blalok's parlor but the same
people were present: Alexander, Blalok, Jordan, and himself.
Somehow Alexander seemed to have shrunk. He was no longer as
impressive as he had been. But the man still radiated force, even
though it didn't seem quite so overpowering. The year, Kennon
thought, had done much to build his self-confidence. He felt
assured rather than nervous.

<P>&quot;Good to see you, Kennon,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;Reports say you're doing a good job.&quot;

<P>&quot;I can't claim the credit,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;Eighty-five per cent of our success is due to co-operation
from the operating staff. And that's Blalok's doing -- he knocked
the heads of the division managers together and they took care of
their staffs. Otherwise we could have had a bad time.&quot;

<P>&quot;But you didn't,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;And you were
the motive force.&quot;

<P>&quot;I've darn near motivated myself out of a job,&quot;
Kennon said. &quot;They co-operate all too well nowadays.&quot;

<P>&quot;Which goes to prove that my theories on preventive
medicine are right,&quot; Alexander said, turning to Blalok.

<P>&quot;It looks that way,&quot; Blalok admitted, &quot;but that
could be because you picked a good man.&quot;

<P>&quot;He's good in more ways than one,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;Or did he tell you he saved Douglas's life out on Otpen
One?&quot;

<P>&quot;He's never said a word.&quot;

<P>Alexander smiled. &quot;Another point in his favor. He knows
how to keep his mouth shut.&quot;

<P>&quot;Not when he's telling someone what to do about
disease,&quot; Jordon interjected.

<P>&quot;Or telling someone off when they haven't followed
directions,'' Blaiok added.

<P>&quot;Better and better. I was sure that he was the one we
needed when we first met.&quot;

<P>Kennon felt his ears turn flaming red.

<P>&quot;But that's not the reason I brought you here. This isn't
a Jac Kennon admiration society. I called you because I want to
expand the Lani breeding program.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why?&quot; Jordan asked.

<P>Blalok stiffened. &quot;You know my feeling about that, sir.
I've never liked the idea of selling them. If that's what's in
your mind--&quot;

<P>Alexander shook his head. &quot;Simmer down,&quot; he said, as
he seated himself at the head of the table. &quot;There's going
to be no selling. The Lani are too valuable for that. We'll need
them more than the money they'd bring on the market. You see --
I've acquired a planet out on the periphery. A place called
Phoebe. One of our ships found it, and I staked a discovery claim
on the major land mass, and the crew made lesser claims that
covered all the available land. Last month the Brotherhood
allowed the claims. Last week the crewmen sold me their land.
Phoebe's a lovely place -- quite a bit like Flora -- and the
ecological tests show it's capable of supporting mammalian life.
Just before I came here I sent three shiploads of exterminators
to clean it up and make it ready for us. It should be ready in
two years.&quot;

<P>&quot;What sort of an ecology are you exterminating?&quot;
Jordan asked.

<P>&quot;Not that it makes any difference,&quot; Alexander said,
&quot;but it's mainly reptilian. Nothing over Group I. We'll
restock with Floran animals.&quot;

<P>Jordan sighed. &quot;Since that's the way it is, it doesn't
make any difference,&quot; he said.  &quot;But it could have. The
Lani are sensitive to things like that. If they thought that they
were walking in over a pile of bodies they'd do badly. It'd be
like Olympus all over again. And we couldn't keep them from
knowing. We talk and we forget, but they'd tell each other - and
they'd remember.&quot;

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; Alexander said, &quot;somehow they've
never forgotten that Grandfather trapped the last of the Lani
males on Olympus.&quot;

<P>Jordan nodded. &quot;They can't stand the place. That's why we
had to abandon the station.&quot;

<P>&quot;Does this new world have a moon?&quot; Kennon asked
abruptly.

<P>&quot;Yes -- in fact it has two.&quot;

<P>&quot;Habitable?&quot;

<P>&quot;No -- they're too small to hold air. But men could live
there in domes -- but why do you? -- oh! I see! I hadn't
considered that point.&quot; Alexander's hand darted to the phone
beside him. &quot;Get me Albertsville,&quot; he snapped.
&quot;Yes, my offices -- I want Mr. Oliver in purchasing and
contracting. Hello -- Ward? Alexander here. Yes -- everything's
fine. I have a job for you -- use your scrambler - pattern
two.&quot; Alexander dialed the scrambler code on the second dial
at the base of the phone, effectively preventing eavesdropping by
beam tappers. &quot;Yes,&quot; he went on. &quot;It's Project
Phoebe. Have you secured title to the moons? You haven't? Well --
you'd better do it before some of our competitors get bright
ideas. Sure they know about the project -- do you think they're
stupid? Warren over at Consolidated practically told me that he
was onto our scheme. So get title to those moons. Since they're
uninhabitable and within the planet's primary field they come
under the Spatial Debris Act and you should be able to get
Kardonian title without any great amount of trouble. Naturally we
want them. -- For defense -- what else? We'll have most of our
eggs in that basket. No -- I don't know how we overlooked that
point. But if it wasn't for a bright young man out here we'd have
left ourselves wide open. Now get cracking -- get that leak
plugged!&quot; Alexander dropped the phone back in its cradle and
sighed. &quot;Well -- that's buttoned up,&quot; he said.
&quot;Thanks, Kennon.&quot;

<P>Kennon looked at Alexander's grinning face, his own impassive,
but a shattering certainty exploded in his mind - <I>Alexander
was a telepath!</I> That was his difference! That was the thing
that made him feared and respected by his business associates. It
wouldn't have been enough on the Central Worlds, where men knew
of sensitives and took precautions against them. But out here on
the periphery it was a deadly advantage.

<P>&quot;So I gave it away,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;I suppose
I was careless, but your thoughts about the moons shocked
me.&quot;

<P>&quot;You practically told me once before, when you hired
me,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;but I never realized it.&quot;

<P>&quot;You were too excited then.&quot;

<P>&quot;I wouldn't know,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;At any rate I
didn't add the facts correctly.&quot; From somewhere deep in his
memory an old quip came floating to the surface: &quot;An
executive is a man who picks brains -- others' brains.&quot; By
that definition Alexander was an executive of the first class.
Alexander  chuckled.

<P>Suddenly Kennon wanted to run. Panic flooded him! What had he
been thinking about? Had he thought of -- two times two are four,
four times four are sixteen, sixteen times sixteen are -- let's
see, six times sixteen is ninety-six, one times sixteen is --
six, five, carry one -- two -- two hundred fifty-six. Two hundred
fifty-six times--

<P>&quot;What's eating you?&quot; Alexander demanded.

<P>&quot;I'm angry,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I told you the
conditions I'd sign that contract, and you wrote a Peeper Clause
into it. And then you peep in the worst way possible. There's no
defense against a Telep unless you know about him; you've had my
whole mind bare! You've violated my personal privacy like no man
has done before. Sure I'm mad. I expected honesty from you -- and
you peep!&quot; The anger was stronger now -- a wave of raw
emotion based on a lifetime of training in mutual respect of a
man's privacy -- a feeling intensified by his childhood
environment of a crowded planetary ecology and the cramped crew
quarters on a spaceship. To Kennon, Alexander had committed the
ultimate sin.

<P>&quot;I can see I made a mistake by not telling you,&quot;
Alexander said. His voice was cold. &quot;But you have no right
to insult me.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm not saying it, am I?&quot; Kennon snapped. The
moonflower on the bookcase behind Alexander was a thing of
beauty. Alexander liked beauty. He had said so, and the Great
Hall below them bore it out. It was a lovely room. Those four
bronze Lani in the fountain were works of art. One of them looked
remarkably like Copper. Copper in bronze. The little witch had
probably posed for the casting. Maybe it had even been made from
her body.

<P>&quot;They're all of Susy,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;I can
see why you are angry, and I don't blame you. But remember I
warned you about Lani.&quot;

<P>Copper -- Kennon wrenched his thoughts back to the moonflower.
It had twelve petals, limpid white on the borders shading to deep
blue in the center-from which the cream-colored stamen surrounded
by transparent pistils sprang to burst into a golden glory of
pollen that dripped in tiny yellow flecks to the broad petals
below. It was a magnificent flower. There was nothing like it on
Beta. That was a marvelous thing about flowers -- wherever one
went in the universe, plants used the same methods to fertilize
their seed and spread their germ plasm. It was too bad that --
Kennon jerked his attention to Alexander's face. He detested the
thought that his mind was common property. A man should have
something he can call his own. There had been a clinics
instructor in Year Six who was a sensitive. The classes had
protected themselves against his prying with a circlet -- a
thought screen -- he had done it too. Maybe he had brought the
circlet with him. If he did, no one was going to catch him
without it. It was a dirty business, this reading of others'
thought. Now where had he put that circlet? Was it among his old
books -- or was it with his instruments?

<P>&quot;Why don't you go back to your house and find it?&quot;
Alexander snapped. &quot;As you are, you're nothing but a
disruption. I want you in on this meeting, but not the way you're
acting.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm not going to act any other way until I get some
protection from peeping,&quot; Kennon said grimly. &quot;And if
you think this is bad wait till I start going through comparative
anatomy.''

<P>&quot;What's the matter with you two?&quot; Blalok asked.

<P>&quot;Be quiet,&quot; Alexander snapped. &quot;This isn't your
problem. Kennon is behaving like a spoiled child!&quot;

<P>&quot;He's a telepath!&quot; Kennon said. &quot;And he didn't
tell me.&quot;

<P>&quot;So what? I've known that for years.&quot;

<P>&quot;And you stand for it?&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm a Mystic, not a Betan,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;I
don't have your insane desire for privacy.&quot;

<P>&quot;Go find that thought screen if you still have if!&quot;
Alexander said. &quot;I don't want any more of this. You're
making me ill!&quot;

<P>Kennon grinned thinly as he rose to his feet. It was a good
thing he remembered Alexander was squeamish and didn't like
anatomy. The door was to his left, an iris door with eight leaves
-- terribly old-fashioned. About ten steps away. Count them --
one -- two -- three--

<P>Alexander sighed as Kennon left the room. &quot;I certainly
pushed the panic button on that young man,&quot; he said.
&quot;He has a pathological attitude toward telepathy. Wonder
what he has to hide that he wants privacy so badly? Even for a
Betan this reaction was violent.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh, I don't know. He's a pretty emotional sort. Maybe he
hates to look like a fool. He's gotten himself mixed up with one
of the Lani. Cute little thing by the name of Copper,&quot;
Blalok said.

<P>&quot;Oh -- that's it. I thought that was what he was hiding.
A picture of a girl kept popping up.&quot; Alexander chuckled.
&quot;I suppose that's the trouble. A man hardly likes to look a
fool, particularly to someone who has warned him. At that, I
don't blame him. They are beautiful and affectionate. And even
with their superstitions and tabus they're better than most
humans.&quot;

<P>&quot;For pets,&quot; Blalok said heavily.

<P>&quot;They're not better at anything,&quot; Jordan demurred.
&quot;They can't be -- man is the best and always will be.&quot;

<P>&quot;The eternal racial chauvinist,&quot; Alexander murmured.
He turned his attention to Blalok. &quot;But for awhile, Evald,
I'd suggest you keep an eye on our young man. I still don't like
his reaction. It was too violent -- too defensive. I don't feel
right about it. Perhaps Betans are more sensitive than most
people but it seems to me that he's trying to conceal something.
There was an undertone of fear -- and something else -- beneath
his defenses.&quot;

<P>&quot;Couldn't you get any more than that?&quot; Blalok asked.
&quot;You're pretty good at this mind-reading business.&quot;

<P>&quot;His defenses were remarkably good,&quot; Alexander said
dryly.

<P>* * *

<P>Well he'd done it now, Kennon thought. He found the
thought-screen circlet sandwiched between two books on
comparative neuroanatomy which he hadn't bothered to unpack. He
slipped it on and connected the lead wires to a portable battery
pack. There was a half-forgotten tingling as the weak field
heterodyned his thought waves. Kennon sighed. If Alexander wasn't
suspicious of him now the man was a fool. He'd done as well as he
could with confusion and outrage, but it was hardly possible to
hide behind superficialities. Even the most disciplined mind
couldn't do that without some preparation. Undoubtedly his
concern about Copper had leaked through. He could only hope that
other and more important things had not.

<P>Well -- he could go back to the conference now, but he would
have to be doubly careful from now on. He couldn't make daily
trips to Olympus. His reaction had killed that plan. Alexander
would be suspicious now -- and unusual actions would crystallize
suspicion to certainty. Now he needed a reason to be in that
area. And then he grinned. He had a reason -- a good one -- one
that would fit in with Alexander's plans and his own. The only
problem would be to make Alexander buy it -- and that might be
difficult. He'd have to work carefully -- but with normal luck he
could put the idea across. He crossed his fingers as he trudged
back up the path to Alexandria.

<P>The conference dragged on. Unlike most meetings, this one
accomplished things -- which was a tribute to Alexander's ability
to keep the subject in hand. Details of the expansion program
presented by Alexander were rapidly reduced to workable plans.
They involved some rearrangement of existlng facilities, and the
construction of others. But the obvious snags were rapidly
disposed of, and the whole revamped operation was outlined on
paper in surprisingly few hours. A deadline date was set,
construction was authorized, and in the morning the first steps
in the practical implementation of the new program would be
taken.

<P>&quot;Well, that's that,&quot; Alexander said with a sigh.
&quot;I think this calls for a drink.&quot;

<P>&quot;There's one more thing,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I know
it isn't much, but Jordan's remark started me thinking.&quot;

<P>&quot;What remark?&quot; Jordan asked.

<P>&quot;The one you made at the beginning about Phoebe possibly
being like the Olympus Station. I've often wondered why that
particular location has been so difficult to operate. Sure, I
know the accepted explanation, but I think we should learn why it
works and how to break a tabu. If we don't, we might be in for
trouble.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's a good thought,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;I
tried to find out once, but all I could discover was that it was
tabu. The Lani simply didn't like it. And despite the fact that I
can read minds, I didn't learn any more than that. There's a
certain sex-linkage to telepathy, as you probably know.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded.

<P>&quot;All I could discover was that their dislike of Olympus
was a basic emotion rather than reasoned thought. They were
nervous, irritable, disobedient, and uncooperative while they
were there -- and even they didn't know why. It was merely tabu.
We even tried youngsters -- but the attitude was the same. I'd
like to know more about that basic emotion.&quot;

<P>&quot;We should understand it,&quot; Kennon agreed. &quot;If
we transship a large number of Lani to a strange world, we should
know their deepest motivations. We cannot take the chance that
the transplant won't take, with all the money you're sinking into
this project.&quot;

<P>&quot;You have a point there. Have you any suggestions about
how to accomplish this?&quot; Alexander's voice was interested.

<P>&quot;I have. Hire a psychologist. And reopen Olympus.&quot;

<P>&quot;It'll be the same story,&quot; Jordan said.

<P>&quot;Not if you apply experimental procedure,&quot; Kennon
said. &quot;Divide the place into a number of separate units in
which groups of -- say ten -- Lani of various ages are kept. Let
every group know where they are, but don't let them come in
contact with one another. Observe them constantly. Put spy cells
in the units. Couple them to recorders. Prepare a set of test
situations and observe how each group performs. Question
individuals under narcosynthesis. Observe and record any changes
in physical condition -- give them the works. Maybe we can
collect some basic data that will indicate the answer.&quot;

<P>&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; Alexander said.

<P>&quot;I don't like it,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;It sounds
cumbersome.&quot;

<P>&quot;It is,&quot; Kennon agreed. &quot;But it may save a
great deal of trouble later.&quot;

<P>&quot;I think you're right, Kennon,&quot; Blalok said.
&quot;We should know everything we can.&quot;

<P>&quot;What would you do first if you were heading this
program?&quot; Alexander asked. He eyed Kennon critically.

<P>&quot;Nothing,&quot; Kennon said promptly. &quot;I'm not
qualified to run an investigation like this. You need a
specialist. I am a practitioner.&quot;

<P>&quot;Hmm -- but you know experimental procedure.&quot;

<P>&quot;Naturally -- but I do not have the training to prepare a
program or evaluate its results. The only thing I could do would
be to check the physical condition of the experimental
groups.&quot;

<P>&quot;Could you set up the physical facilities?&quot;
Alexander asked.

<P>&quot;Possibly -- I'd need a set of plans of the station, and
I couldn't guarantee that the specialist wouldn't want to make
changes. But the physical arrangements should be simple enough to
construct.&quot;

<P>&quot;How long would it take you to prepare a plan?&quot;

<P>&quot;I could have it by tomorrow, or perhaps a day
later.&quot;

<P>&quot;If you can do it by then I'll stay over. I'd like to
examine this proposal more closely. It has merit. That's the
second constructive suggestion you've made tonight. Despite your
peculiar desire for privacy, I'm glad you came back.&quot;
Alexander smiled.

<P>Kennon smiled back. Apparently the entrepreneur had taken the
bait. But it was too early to tell whether he had swallowed it
without reservation. It all depended upon how much had been given
away before he had discovered that Alexander was a telepath.
Perhaps Alexander was merely leading him on. There were too many
intangibles, and there was no way of predicting how it would turn
out. But he felt mildly optimistic.

<P>Alexander closed the meeting, and Kennon left promptly. He had
a good excuse. There was plenty of work to do if he was going to
prepare an adequate plan for utilizing Olympus Station. Jordan
went with him, but Blalok stayed behind. It was natural enough.
Blalok was the administrator, but Kennon felt uneasy. Nor would
he have felt any better if he could have heard what went on after
he left.

<P>Alexander looked quizzically at Blalok after the door closed
behind the two men.

<P>&quot;Well, Evald, what do you think? Does it strike you that
Kennon's sincere -- or does it sound as though he has something
up his sleeve?&quot;

<P>&quot;If he does,&quot; Blalok said, &quot;I don't know what
it could be. I wouldn't take a job on Olympus if you gave it to
me.&quot;

<P>&quot;If he doesn't know about the place,&quot; Alexander said
thoughtfully, &quot;it's probable that his suggestion was honest.
I think it is but I'm not sure. He worries me now that I can't
read him. I think I'll send Douglas back here to watch him.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why? In my book that'd be a poor choice. After all, you
said Kennon saved his life. He should be grateful.&quot;

<P>&quot;You don't know Douglas,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;He
hates Kennon's guts for what he did.&quot;

<P>&quot;What did he do?&quot;

<P>&quot;He made Douglas feel inferior. And there's no surer way
to gain my cousin's undying enmity.&quot; Alexander laughed.
&quot;I know,&quot; he said. &quot;He'd like to kill me,
too.&quot;

<P>Blalok shrugged.

<P>&quot;But in the meantime I want you to keep an eye on Kennon.
If his outline is all right, I'm going to authorize him to set up
this experiment. I want to give him every possible chance. I like
him -- and he's done good work. I wouldn't want him to feel that
I distrust him.&quot;

<P>&quot;Which you do, of course,&quot; Blalok said dryly.

<P>Alexander smiled. &quot;Actually,&quot; he said with equal
dryness, &quot;I distrust everyone.&quot;

<P>CHAPTER XVI

<P>&quot;If you think this job is easy, you have another think
coming,&quot; Kennon said bitterly. &quot;I hired out as a
veterinarian, not as a nursemaid for a bunch of psychoneurotic
humans and superstitious Lani. The place is jinxed, they tell me.
-- Ha! Jinxed! Sure it's jinxed! What job wouldn't be with a
bunch of goofballs like these I've got working on it.

<P>&quot;I can't keep a Lani here for two weeks without having
her throw a catfit, and the superstitious idiots are affecting
the men -- who ought to know better! I wish I'd never have opened
my big mouth to Alexander! As far as I'm concerned he can take
this job and--&quot;

<P>&quot;Hey -- take it easy, man!&quot; Blalok said.
&quot;You're heading straight for a nervous breakdown.&quot;

<P>&quot;And why shouldn't I?&quot; Kennon asked. &quot;Nothing
goes right. There's always trouble. I order materials -- they
don't arrive. There's worker trouble, equipment trouble,
installation trouble. Everybody's cutting corners, trying to get
done faster and away sooner -- and all they do is mess up work
that should have been done right the first time. We should have
been finished last week, but we have another week to go, at least
unless some bumble-fingered beanbrain gets another bright idea
that sets us back again. I'm sick to death of it!&quot;

<P>&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Blalok said soothingly, &quot;and
I'm sorry.&quot;

<P>&quot;Sorry? What good is that? You and Jordan come up here in
relays. Just what do you think you'll find? Or has Alexander
dragged you into keeping an eye on me because I don't like
someone snooping inside my skull?&quot;

<P>&quot;It's not that,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;It's
just----&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh, don't make excuses. You know and I know the Boss-man
is suspicious.&quot; Kennon shrugged. &quot;Normally I wouldn't
blame him but it's a damned nuisance with things the way they
are. All we have is one more bay and a hall to finish - but
if---- &quot;

<P>&quot;Now wait a minute,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;Get the kink
out of your neck and simmer down. Sure -- the Boss-man told us to
keep an eye on you -- but that's not why I'm here this
time.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well?&quot;

<P>&quot;Douglas came back this morning.&quot;

<P>&quot;What for?&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't know.&quot; Blalok's face wore the noncommittal
look it always wore when he was taking liberties with the truth.

<P>&quot;You're probably the worst liar in the galaxy,&quot;
Kennon chuckled. &quot;He's here to breathe down my neck, isn't
he?&quot;

<P>Blalok nodded.

<P>&quot;Keep him off my back for another week and he can breathe
all he wants to. I'll be done then.&quot;

<P>&quot;I can't promise a thing.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. &quot;It's too much to ask, I guess.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I can try,&quot; Blalok added.

<P>&quot;That's enough for me.&quot; Kennon grinned. &quot;Has he
turned Alexandria into a shambles yet?&quot;

<P>&quot;Not yet, but everyone's uneasy.&quot;

<P>&quot;I can't blame them. That young fellow's undiluted
poison. By the way, how does he look?&quot;

<P>&quot;About the same.&quot;

<P>&quot;The medics must have done a good job,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;The Boss-man shipped him to Beta for treatment,&quot;
Blalok said. &quot;He didn't trust the docs out here.&quot;

<P>&quot;That figures. At any rate Douglas couldn't have gone to
a better place.&quot;

<P>&quot;What happened to him?&quot;

<P>&quot;He stuck his nose where he shouldn't,&quot; Kennon said
pointedly.

<P>Blalok stiffened.

<P>&quot;I'm sorry, Evald. Even if you knew, I couldn't talk
about it. What I know about Douglas is classified!&quot;

<P>&quot;Well -- Douglas is doing plenty of talking. Claims his
stay in the hospital was all your fault.&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. &quot;That's his opinion. And as long as he
stays out of my way he's welcome to it.&quot;

<P>Blalok looked at Kennon's haggard face with mild concern,
&quot;Doc,&quot; he said, &quot;you'd better take it easy. You're
going to pieces.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll be through here in another week, I'll have this all
wrapped up.&quot;

<P>&quot;Providing you're not wrapped up first.&quot;

<P>&quot;Eh?&quot;

<P>&quot;In a shroud. You look like a walking corpse.&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled wearily. &quot;Sometimes I feel like one. But
I'd like to get this job finished.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well, I'll do what I can,&quot; Blalok said. &quot;I'll
try to keep him down at Alexandria for a few days.&quot;

<P>&quot;It'll be enough,&quot; Kennon said. More than enough --
he added mentally. The coils of fuel wire were ready to load, and
the power slugs for the ship's reactor were already stored in the
power plant building here at Olympus. Three more days and the old
spacer would be as ready to fly as she would ever be. And after
that, it was in the lap of fate.

<P>He ushered Blalok to his jeep and watched until he
disappeared.

<P>&quot;I'm getting to be a first-class liar,&quot; he remarked
wryly to himself as he turned back to the temporary quarters he
was occupying at the station. &quot;And the bad thing about it is
that I'm actually enjoying it.&quot;

<P>A few weeks ago an admission like that would have been
inconceivable. It was odd, he thought, how one thing led to
another and produced an end that could not be foreseen. Now he
could lie and dissemble with the best. He had no compunction
about falsifying a requisition, or stealing what he could not
obtain with apparent honesty. His character had sunk to an
all-time low, he reflected with grim humor as he walked into the
shadow of the main building. Neither Blalok's nor Jordan's
frequent visits bothered him. Both men were creatures of habit
and both were married. They stayed home at night -- and it was
nighttime that he worked on the spacer. The project afforded him
a perfect cover and it was only minutes by jeep away from the
crater.

<P>Even so, the double duty was an appalling task. And it would
have been impossible if it wasn't for Copper. Her quick fingers,
keen eyesight, and uncanny memory made the work seem simple, and
neither the tediousness of repairing miles of circuitry nor the
depressing environment of Olympus Station seemed to bother her.
While he worked with the men on the project she restored and
reassembled circuits in his quarters and at night they replaced
them in the old ship. And the God-Egg was rapidly becoming
operational.

<P>Kennon wondered what it was about Copper that made her so
different from the rest. Olympus didn't bother her at all. In
fact she seemed to thrive on the depressing atmosphere that
filled the Station. Perhaps it was because she had violated the
tabu about the God-Egg so often that ordinary superstition had no
effect upon her. He shrugged. He had  troubles enough without
worrying about Copper's motivations, and not the least of these
was taking the God-Egg into space.

<P>Kennon looked forward to blast-off with distinct misgivings.
There was too much about the ancient spacer that was strange --
and too much that was terrifying.

<P>Basically the ship was an ion-jet job with atomic primaries
and a spindizzy converter that might possibly take her up as high
as middle yellow Cth -- far enough to give her a good turn of
speed, but not enough to compensate for timelag. Her screens were
monstrosities, double polyphase lattices that looked about as
spacetight as so many sieves. There were no acceleration dampers,
no temporal compensators, no autopilot, no four-space computer,
and the primaries operated on nuclear rather than binding energy.
The control chairs weren't equipped with forcefields, but instead
had incredibly primitive safety webs that held one in place by
sheer tensile strength. Taking a ship like that into space was an
open invitation to suicide. A man needed a combination of
foolhardy bravery and incredible fatalism to blast off in a can
like this. He had the stimulus, but the knowledge of what he
would face troubled him more than he cared to admit. More and
more, as he understood the ship, he was amazed at the courage of
the ancients who had blithely leaped into hyperspace in these
flying coffins with no more motivation than to see what was
beyond the nearest star. And in ships more primitive than this
men had swept through the star systems nearest Earth in the
outward expansion of the First Millennium.

<P>He sighed. The breed of man must have been tough in the old
days -- and he'd soon be finding out if any of that ancient
toughness remained.

<P>He opened the door to his quarters.

<P>Copper was sitting in his favorite chair, a pile of completed
assemblies neatly stacked beside her, and a disorderly file of
crumpled cloth at her feet. Her face was sullen as she looked up
at him. &quot;I've had about all of this I'm going to take,&quot;
she said mutinously as she stirred the heap of cloth with a bare
foot. &quot;Not even you are going to make me wear those --
<I>things!</I>&quot;

<P>Kennon sighed. It was the same old story. For months he had
been trying patiently to indoctrinate Copper with a minimum of
civilized habits, but she was quite literally a savage. In her
entire lifetime she had never worn clothing, and to encase her
body in hose, kilts, blouse, and sandals was a form of torture.
She scratched, wiggled, and twisted at the garments until she
looked as bad as she felt, and would usually finish a session by
tearing off the offending clothes and sulking. She was doing it
now.

<P>&quot;You must act like a civilized human being,&quot; Kennon
said mildly. &quot;You're simply going to have to learn to wear
these clothes properly.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why? I'm more comfortable as I am.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's not the point. You are going to be living in
human society and you must act human. The only planet where you
could get away with nudity is Santos, and we're not going
there.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;

<P>&quot;I've explained it time and again. We'll have to go to
Beta. That's the only place I know where you'll have a fair
hearlng. And on Beta people wear clothes. They have to. It's
cold, even in summer, and in the wintertime, there's snow.&quot;

<P>&quot;What's snow?&quot;

<P>&quot;Ice crystals that fall like rain, but I've told you this
before.&quot;

<P>&quot;And I still don't believe it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Believe it or not you're going to wear those things. Now
put them on!&quot;

<P>She looked at him with mutiny on her face. &quot;All right,
slave driver,&quot; she muttered as she picked up the clothing,
&quot;but I hope you'll itch someday and be unable to
scratch.&quot;

<P>&quot;And try to wear those garments more gracefully. You make
them look like a sack.&quot;

<P>&quot;They feel like one. I keep thinking that all I need is a
tag around my neck.&quot;

<P>&quot;You haven't much time to get used to them,&quot; Kennon
said. &quot;We're leaving this week.&quot;

<P>&quot;So soon?&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes -- and you'll wear those things to the ship, into
the ship, and all the time we're on the ship. You'll keep wearing
clothing until it looks right.&quot;

<P>&quot;Slave driver!&quot; Copper hissed.

<P>&quot;Slave,&quot; Kennon answered equably.

<P>Copper giggled. The sound was utterly unexpected, and
completely incongruous. That was the wonder of her, Kennon
reflected. Her mercurial temperament made life something that was
continually exciting She was a never-ending delight.

<P>CHAPTER XVII

<P>It was the last trip. Kennon loaded the jeep with the
last-minute items he would need. The four reactor cores in their
lead cases went aboard last and were packed inside a pile of
lead-block shielding.

<P>He helped Copper in and looked back without regret as the bulk
of Olympus Station vanished below him in the dusk. The last of
the work crew had left that afternoon. The station was ready for
occupancy. His assignment had been completed. He felt an odd
pleasure at having finished the job. Alexander might not be happy
about his subsequent actions, but he could have no complaint
about what he did while he was here.

<P>&quot;Well -- say good-bye to Flora,&quot; he said to Copper.

<P>&quot;I don't want to,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't want to
leave.&quot;

<P>&quot;You can't stay. You know that.&quot;

<P>She nodded. &quot;But that doesn't make me any less
regretful.&quot;

<P>&quot;Regretful?&quot;

<P>&quot;All right -- scared. We're going to try to make the
God-Egg fly again. Not only is it sacrilege, but as you've often
said, it's dangerous. I have no desire to die.&quot;

<P>&quot;You have two courses---&quot;

<P>&quot;I know -- you've pointed them out often enough,&quot;
Copper said. &quot;And since you decided to go I'd go with you
even though I knew the Egg would blow up.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're quite a girl,&quot; Kennon said admiringly.
&quot;Did I ever tell you that I love you?&quot;

<P>&quot;Not nearly often enough,&quot; Copper said. &quot;You
could do it every day and I'd never get tired of hearing
it.&quot;

<P>The jeep settled over the lava wall. &quot;We'll leave it in
the passageway when we're through,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Maybe
it will survive blast-off.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why worry about it?&quot; Copper asked.

<P>&quot;I hate destroying anything needlessly,&quot; Kennon
said.

<P>&quot;And since we have plenty of time, we might as well be
neat about our departure.&quot;

<P>He was wrong, of course, but he didn't know that.

<P>* * *

<P>Douglas Alexander checked the radarscope and whistled in
surprise at the picture it revealed. &quot;So that's where he's
going,&quot; he said softly to himself. &quot;Cousin Alex was
right as usual.&quot; He grimaced unpleasantly. &quot;He's up to
something -- that's for sure.&quot; His face twisted into an
expression that was half sneer, half triumph. &quot;This is going
to be fun.&quot; He moved the control, and his airboat, hovering
silently at five thousand meters, dropped toward the ground in
free fall as Douglas loosened the Burkholtz in the holster at his
waist. &quot;But what is he doing?&quot; he muttered. The
question hung unanswered in the still air of the cabin as the
airboat dropped downward.

<P>Douglas hadn't been impressed with Blalok's attempt at a
delaying action. Normally he might have been, but his fear of his
cousin was greater than his respect for Blalok. The
superintendent had only succeeded in accomplishing something he
had not intended when he had tried to dissuade Douglas from
visiting Kennon. He had made Douglas cautious. The airboat and
long-range surveillance had been the result. For the past two
nights Douglas had hung over Olympus Station, checking the place
-- to leave at dawn when the new day's work began. For two nights
Kennon had been lucky. He had departed for the Egg shortly before
Douglas took up his station, and had returned after the watcher
had called it a night and had returned home. But this last night,
Kennon left late -- and his departure was noted.

<P>&quot;Wonder who's the girl with him?&quot; Douglas said as
the boat plunged down. &quot;Well, I'll be finding out in a
minute.&quot;

<P>Kennon's head jerked upward at the sound of air whistling past
the airboat's hull, and a wave of icy coldness swept through his
chest. There was no question that he was discovered. His
shoulders sagged.

<P>&quot;Well -- it was a good try,&quot; he said bitterly as
Copper looked at him with sudden terror on her face.

<P>&quot;I don't <I>want</I> to die,&quot; she wailed.

<P>&quot;You won't -- not if I can help it,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;Move away from me -- quickly!&quot;

<P>&quot;But--&quot;

<P>&quot;Do as I say!&quot; Kennon's voice was sharp. &quot;And
keep that hood over your face.&quot;

<P>The airboat settled softly on the ash in front of him, the
door snapped open and Douglas dropped to the ground, Burkholtz
jutting from his pudgy fist.

<P>&quot;My, my,&quot; Douglas said, &quot;what have we here? Dr.
Kennon and a woman! I thought better of you than that, Doctor.
And all dressed up in antiradiation suits. This is interesting.
Just what are you doing up here on the mountain so late at night
-- prospecting?&quot;

<P>&quot;You might call it that,&quot; Kennon said. His body
sagged with relief. Douglas thank Ochsner it was Douglas! He was
running true to form -- talking when he should have been
shooting.

<P>Douglas jerked his head toward Copper, standing a few feet to
his left. &quot;Who is she?&quot;

<P>&quot;None of your business,&quot; Kennon snapped, hoping that
his outburst covered Copper's gasp of surprise and fear, and
knowing that it didn't.

<P>&quot;I'm making it my business. There's something funny going
on around here.&quot;

<P>Kennon blinked. Could it be that Douglas didn't <I>know?</I>
Had he been watching them on <I>radar? </I>Durilium was
radar-transparent. It absorbed and dissipated electromagnetic
waves rather than reflecting them. For a second he felt a tiny
surge of hope.

<P>&quot;Stand where you are,&quot; Douglas said as he stepped
over to the half-paralyzed Copper and jerked the hood back from
her face. For a moment he looked puzzled. &quot;Just who are
you?&quot; he demanded. &quot;I don't recall seeing you
before.&quot; And then recognition dawned. &quot;Old Doc's
Lani!&quot; he gasped.

<P>&quot;She works for me now,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>Douglas laughed. It wasn't a nice sound. &quot;All dressed
up?&quot; he asked. &quot;Nice work.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's my fault,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;You know the rules,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;I could
blast you both.&quot;

<P>&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;but if you do, you'll
never find out what we're doing up here.&quot;

<P>Douglas hesitated. Kennon's voice was flat and filled with
utter conviction.

<P>&quot;There's a reason why Copper's wearing that suit,&quot;
Kennon continued, &quot;and you won't know that either.&quot;

<P>The Burkholtz swiveled around to point at Kennon's belly.
&quot;I've had about enough of this. Let's have it. Tell me what
you're doing here!&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll do better than that,&quot; Kennon said promptly.
&quot;I'll show you. You'll be surprised at what we've
uncovered.&quot; He made his muscles relax, and forced himself to
speak naturally. Copper, he noted, was still rigid with terror.
The Alexanders -- any of them -- were everything he had said they
were. They were the masters here. And despite Copper's boast, she
was as susceptible to their influence as any other Lani.

<P>&quot;All right,&quot; Douglas said, &quot;show me this thing
I'd never be able to find without your help.&quot; He half turned
to Copper. &quot;Stay where you are, Lani,&quot; he said.
&quot;Don't move until I come back.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes, Man Douglas,&quot; Copper replied. Her voice was
flat, colorless, and submissive.

<P>Kennon shuddered. He had never heard precisely that tone from
her before. One word from Douglas and she had become a zombie --
a mindless muscle preparation that existed only to obey. Anger
filled him -- anger that one he loved could be ordered by someone
who wasn't worth a third of her -- anger that she obeyed -- anger
at his own impotence and frustration. It wasn't a clean anger. It
was a dark, red-splashed thing that struggled and writhed inside
him, a fierce unreasoning rage that seethed and bubbled yet could
not break free. For an instant, with blinding clarity, Kennon
understood the feelings of the caged male Lani on Otpen One. And
he sympathized.

<P>&quot;Follow me,&quot; he said and started around the ship.

<P>&quot;Stay -- no -- go ahead,&quot; Douglas said, &quot;but
remember, I'm right behind you.&quot;

<P>Kennon walked straight up to the pit and pointed down at the
dark bulk of the Egg., concealed in the shadows of the bottom.

<P>&quot;That's it&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;What? I don't see anything,&quot; Douglas said
suspiciously.

<P>&quot;Here -- I'll shine a light.&quot; Kennon reached for his
belt.

<P>&quot;No you don't! I know that trick. You're not going to
blind me. Take that torch loose carefully -- that's it -- now
hand it to me.&quot; Douglas' hand closed over the smooth
plastic. Cautiously he turned on the beam and directed it
downward.

<P>&quot;A spacer!&quot; he gasped. &quot;How did that get
here?&quot; He leaned forward to look into the pit as a dark
shadow materialized behind him.

<P>Kennon choked back the involuntary cry of warning that rose in
his throat. Copper! His muscles tensed as her arm came up and
down -- a shadow almost invisible in the starlight. The leaning
figure of Douglas collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been
suddenly released. The torch dropped from his hand and went
bouncing and winking down the wall of the pit, followed by
Douglas -- a limp bundle of arms and legs that rotated
grotesquely as he disappeared down the slope. Starlight gleamed
on the Burkholtz lying on the lip of the crater, where it had
fallen from his hand.

<P>&quot;I told you that not even Man Alexander could order me
since I gave my love to you,&quot; Copper said smugly as she
peered over the edge of the pit, a chunk of lava gripped in one
small capable hand. &quot;Maybe this proves it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Douglas isn't Alexander,&quot; Kennon said slowly as he
picked up the blaster, &quot;but I believe you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Didn't I act convincingly?&quot; she said brightly.

<P>&quot;Very,&quot; he said. &quot;You fooled me
completely.&quot;

<P>&quot;The important thing was that I fooled Douglas.&quot;

<P>&quot;You did that all right. Now let's get him out of that
pit.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;

<P>&quot;The jet blast will fry him when we take off.&quot;

<P>&quot;What difference would that make?&quot;

<P>&quot;I told you,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;that I never
destroy things unnecessarily -- not even things like
Douglas.&quot;

<P>&quot;But he would have destroyed you.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's no excuse for murder. Now go back to the jeep and
fetch a rope. I'll go down and get him out.&quot;

<P>&quot;Do we have to bother with him?&quot; Copper asked, and
then shrugged. It was an eloquent gesture expressing disgust,
resignation, and unwilling compliance in one lift of smoothly
muscled shoulders.

<P>&quot;There's no question about it,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;You're becoming more human every day.&quot;

<P>He chuckled as he slid over the edge of the pit following the
path Douglas had taken a moment before. He found him sitting on a
pile of ashes, shaking his head.

<P>&quot;What happened?&quot; Douglas asked querulously. There
was fear in his voice.

<P>&quot;Copper hit you on the head with a rock,&quot; Kennon
said as he bent over and retrieved the torch, still burning near
Douglas' feet.

<P>&quot;The Lani?&quot; Douglas' voice was incredulous.

<P>&quot;Not a Lani,&quot; Kennon corrected. &quot;She's as human
as you or I.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's a lie,&quot; Douglas said.

<P>&quot;Maybe this spacer's a lie too. Her ancestors came in it
-- a pair of humans named Alfred and Melissa Weygand. They were
Christian missionaries from a planet called Heaven out in
Ophiuchus Sector. Went out to convert aliens and landed here when
their fuel ran out.&quot; Kennon paused. &quot;That was about
four millennia ago. Their descendants, naturally, reverted to
barbarism in a few generations, but there's enough evidence in
the ship to prove that the Lani were their children.''

<P>&quot;But the tails -- the differences -- the failure of the
test,&quot; Douglas said.

<P>&quot;Mutation,&quot; Kennon replied. &quot;Those old
spindizzy converters weren't too choosy about how they scattered
radiation. And they had come a long way.&quot; He paused, looking
down at Douglas, feeling a twinge of pity for the man. His world
was crumbling. &quot;And there was no other human blood available
to filter out their peculiarities. It might have been done during
the first couple of generations, but constant inbreeding fixed
the genetic pattern.&quot;

<P>&quot;How did you discover this?&quot; Douglas asked.

<P>&quot;Accident,&quot; Kennon said briefly.

<P>&quot;You'll never be able to prove they're human!&quot;
Douglas said.

<P>&quot;The ship's log will do that.&quot;

<P>&quot;Not without a humanity test -- they can't pass
that.&quot;

<P>&quot;Sorry to disappoint you. Your grandfather used the wrong
sort of sperm. Now if there had been a Betan in the crew--&quot;

<P>&quot;You mean she's <I>pregnant!</I>&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded. &quot;There's been mutation on Beta,&quot; he
said. &quot;And it's apparently a similar one to hers. Betan-Lani
matings are fertile.&quot;

<P>Douglas's shoulders sagged, and then straightened. &quot;I
don't believe it,&quot; he said. &quot;You're just a damned
sneaking spy. Somehow or other you got a spacer in here after you
wormed your way into Cousin Alex's confidence -- and now you're
going to space out with the nucleus of a new farm. Just wait.
When Alex learns of this the galaxy'll be too small to hold
you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Don't babble like a fool!&quot; Kennon said with
disgust. &quot;How could I land a spacer here without being
spotted? You sound like a two-credit novel. And even if I did --
would it be a can like this?&quot; Kennon played the torch over
the blue-black durilium protruding from the ashes.

<P>Douglas' eyes widened as he took in the details of
construction. &quot;What an antique!&quot; he blurted.
&quot;Where did you get this can?&quot;

<P>&quot;I found it here.&quot;

<P>&quot;Tell me another one.&quot;

<P>&quot;You won't believe,&quot; Kennon said flatly,
&quot;because you don't dare believe. You have a mental block.
You've killed, maimed, tortured -- treated them like animals --
and now your mind shrinks from admitting they're human. You know
what will happen if the old court decision is reversed. It will
wreck your little empire, dry up your money, break you -- and you
can't stand the thought of that. You don't dare let us leave, yet
you can't stop us because I have your blaster and I'd just as
soon shoot you as look at your rotten face. Now get on your feet
and start climbing if you want to stay alive. We're getting out
of here, and you'll fry inside this pit.&quot;

<P>&quot;Where are you taking me?&quot;

<P>&quot;Back to your airboat. I'm going to tie you up and set
you off on autopilot. You'll be able to get loose quickly enough
but it'll be too late to stop us. We'll be gone, and you can
think of how you'll manage to face the human race.&quot;

<P>&quot;I hope you blow yourself and that antique clear out of
space.&quot;

<P>&quot;We might. But you'll never know for sure. But mark this
-- if I live I'll be back with the Brotherhood. You can count on
it.&quot;

<P>They struggled up the side of the pit and halted, panting, on
the rim. &quot;How much radiation was down there?&quot; Douglas
asked worriedly.

<P>&quot;Not enough to hurt you.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's good.&quot; Douglas accepted the statement at
face value, a fact which failed to surprise Kennon. &quot;You
know,&quot; he said, &quot;I've been around Lani all my life. And
I know that they're not human. No self-respecting human would
take a tenth of what they put up with.&quot;

<P>&quot;Their ancestors didn't,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;They
fought to the end. But your Grandfather was a smart man even
though he was a Degrader.&quot;

<P>&quot;He <I>wasn't!</I>&quot; Douglas exploded. &quot;No
Alexander is a Degrader.&quot;

<P>&quot;He realized,&quot; Kennon went on, &quot;that he'd never
succeed in enslaving the Lani unless he separated the sexes. And
since women are more subjective in their outlook -- and more
pliable -- he picked them for his slaves. The males he retired to
stud. Probably the fact that there were more women than men
helped him make up his mind.

<P>&quot;In every society,&quot; Kennon went on inexorably,
&quot;there are potential freeman and potential slaves. The
latter invariably outnumber the former. They're cowards: the
timid, the unsacrificing -- the ones that want peace at any price
-- the ones who will trade freedom for security. Those were the
ones who hid rather than risk their lives fighting the aggressor.
Those were the ones who survived. Old Alexander had a ready-made
slave cadre when be finished off the last of the warriors. For
four centuries the survivors have been bred and selected to
perpetuate slave traits. And the system works. The men don't want
freedom -- they want liberty to kill each other. The women don't
want freedom -- they want males. And they'd serve them precisely
as the Sarkian women serve their menfolk. You've killed any
chance they had to become a civilization. It's going to take
generations perhaps before they're reoriented. There's plenty you
Alexanders should answer for.&quot;

<P>&quot;If there's any fault, it's yours,&quot; Douglas snarled.
&quot;We were doing all right until you came here. We'd still be
doing all right if I had shot you both.&quot; His shoulders
sagged. &quot;I should have killed you when I had the
chance,&quot; he said bitterly.

<P>&quot;But you didn't,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;and to show my
gratitude I'm letting you get away with a whole skin. I don't
expect you to be grateful, but at least you'll not be on my
conscience. I don't enjoy killing, not even things like
you.&quot;

<P>Douglas sneered. &quot;You're soft -- a soft sentimental
fool.&quot;

<P>&quot;Admitted,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;but that's my
nature.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yet you'd destroy the family, wreck Outworld
Enterprises, and throw a whole world into chaos over a few
thousand animals. I don't understand you.&quot;

<P>&quot;They're human,&quot; Kennon said flatly.

<P>&quot;Admitting they might once have been, they're not
now.&quot;

<P>&quot;And whose fault is that?&quot;

<P>&quot;Not ours,&quot; Douglas said promptly. &quot;If there is
any fault it's that of the court who decided they were
humanoid.&quot;

<P>&quot;You didn't help any.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why should we? Does one treat a shrake like a brother?
---or a varl? ---or a dog? We treat them like the animals they
are. And we've done no worse with the Lani. Our consciences are
clear.&quot;

<P>Kennon laughed humorlessly. &quot;Yet this clear conscience
makes you want to kill me, so you can keep on treating them as
animals -- even though you know they're human.&quot;

<P>&quot;I know nothing of the sort. But you're right about the
killing, I'd kill you cheerfully if I had the chance. It's our
necks if you get away with this. Of course, you probably won't,
but why take the chance. I like my neck more than I like
yours.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're honest at any rate,&quot; Kennon admitted.
&quot;And in a way I don't blame you. To you it's probably better
to be a rich slaver living off the legacy of a Degrader than a
penniless humanitarian. But you've lost your chance.&quot;

<P>Douglas screamed with rage. He whirled on Kennon, his face a
distorted mask of hate.

<P>&quot;Hold it!&quot; Kennon barked. &quot;I don't want to kill
you, but I'll burn a hole clear through your rotten carcass if
you make another move. I have no love for your kind.&quot;

<P>Douglas spat contemptuously. &quot;You haven't got the
guts,&quot; he snarled. But he didn't move.

<P>&quot;Just stand still -- very still,&quot; Kennon said
softly. The iron in his voice was not hidden by the quiet tone.

<P>Douglas shivered. &quot;I'll get you yet,&quot; he said, but
there was no force in the threat.

<P>&quot;Here's the rope you wanted,&quot; Copper said as she
emerged abruptly from the darkness. &quot;I had a hard time
finding it.&quot;

<P>&quot;You haven't been too long,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Now
tie Douglas' hands behind him while I keep him covered.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's a pleasure,&quot; Copper murmured.

<P>CHAPTER XVIII

<P>&quot;I'm frightened,&quot; Copper said, twisting
uncomfortably in the shock chair beside Kennon's.

<P>&quot;After you have been so brave?&quot; Kennon asked.
&quot;That's nonsense. It's just nervous reaction. Now web in
like I showed you. It's time for blast-off. We don't dare wait
much longer.&quot;

<P>&quot;All right -- but I have a feeling that this isn't right.
Something is going to go wrong.&quot;

<P>&quot;I hope you don't have precognition.&quot; Kennon smiled.
&quot;I've checked everything. The ship is as good as she'll ever
be. There's nothing more that we can do.&quot;

<P>&quot;There's one consolation,&quot; Copper said wanly.
&quot;At we'll die together.&quot;

<P>&quot;There's a better chance that we'll live together.&quot;

<P>&quot;I hope so.&quot;

<P>&quot;Ready?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>She nodded.

<P>He flipped the switches that would send the fuel rods into the
reactor. Below them a soft, barely audible whine ascended the
sonic scale to a point of irritating inaudibility. Kennon smiled.
The spindizzy was functioning properly. He flipped a second bank
of switches and a dull roar came from the buried stem. Ashes and
pumice heated to incandescence were blown through the air. Molten
drops of radioactive lava skittered across the durilium hull as
Kennon advanced the power. The whole stem of the ship was
immersed in a seething lake of bolling rock as the Egg lifted
slowly with ponderous dignity into the night sky.

<P>&quot;Hang on!&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I'm going to
hyper.&quot; His hand moved a red lever and the Egg shimmered and
vanished with a peculiar wrenching motion into an impossible
direction that the mind could not grasp. And the interceptor
missile from Otpen One nosed through the space the Egg had
occupied.

<P>* * *

<P>&quot;We made it!&quot; Kennon said, looking across the
writhing semifluid control board, shifting oddly in the harsh
yellow monochromatic light that pervaded the cabin. The screens
were leaking like sieves, but they were holding well enough to
keep Cth yellow from being anything more than an annoyance. He
glanced over at Copper, a fantastically elongated Copper who
looked like a madman's dream of chaos.

<P>And Copper screamed! The sound echoed and re-echoed, dying
away with a lingering discordant reverberation that made his skin
tingle.

<P>&quot;Copper! It's all right! It's all fight! Stop it!&quot;

<P>Copper screamed again and her elongated figure suddenly
foreshortened and collapsed into a small writhing ball from which
two small pink hands emerged clutching at a gelid mass of air
that flowed sluggishly around them.

<P>And Kennon knew what he had forgotten! Hyperspace with leaky
screens was nothing to inflict upon an unprepared mind. It is one
thing to endure partial exposure after months of training, with
experienced medics standing by to help you through the shock
phase, but quite another to be thrust from a safe and sheltered
existence into the mind shattering distortions of the Cth
continuum.

<P>The Egg was old. Her screens, never good at best, were hardly
more than filters. Through the hull, through the drive lattice,
the viciously distorted Cth environment seeped into the ship
turning prosaic shapes of controls and instruments into writhing
masses of obscene horror that sent extensions wiggling off into
nothingness at eye-aching angles. A spaceman could take this --
knowing it wasn't real -- but a tyro could not.

<P>Copper collapsed. Her mind, assaulted by sensations no
untrained person should experience, went into shock. But she
wasn't granted the mercy of unconsciousness. Terrified by a
pseudo reality that surpassed her wildest nightmares, she stared
wide-eyed at the control room and the thing that had been Kennon.
She screamed until her throat was raw, until the monster beside
her touched her with Kennon's hands. Then, mercifully, she felt a
stinging in her arm and all sensation ceased.

<P>Kennon stared glumly at the controls. Fleming alone knew how
many objective years were passing outside as they hurtled through
four-space. Subjectively it would only be hours aboard the Egg,
but a decade -- or maybe a century -- might pass outside this mad
universe where neither time nor speed had meaning. The old ships
didn't have temporal compensators, nor could they travel through
upper bands of Cth where subjective and objective time were more
nearly equal. They were trapped in a semi-stasis of time as the
ship fled on through the distorted monochromatic regions that
bypassed normal space.

<P>The Egg slipped smoothly out of the hyper jump, back into the
normal universe. Beta floated above them, the blue shield of her
atmosphere shining softly in the light of Beta's sun.

<P>&quot;Couldn't hit it that good again in a hundred
tries,&quot; Kennon gloated. &quot;Halfway across the galaxy --
and right on the nose.&quot; He looked at the shock chair beside
him. Copper was curled into a tight ball inside the confining
safety web, knees drawn up, back bent, head down -- arms wrapped
protectingly around her legs -- the fetal position of catatonic
shock.

<P>He shook her shoulder -- no response. Her pulse was thready
and irregular. Her breathing was shallow. Her lips were blue. Her
condition was obvious -- space shock -- extreme grade. She'd need
medical attention if she was going to live. And she'd need it
fast!

<P>&quot;Just why, you educated nitwit,&quot; he snarled at
himself, &quot;didn't you have sense enough to give her that
injection of Sonmol before we hypered! You haven't the sense of a
decerebrate Capellan grackle!&quot;

<P>He turned on the radio. &quot;Emergency!&quot; he said.
&quot;Any station! Space-shock case aboard. Extreme
urgency.&quot;

<P>&quot;Identify yourself -- give your license. Over.&quot;

<P>&quot;What port are you?&quot;

<P>&quot;Hunterstown -- will you please identify? Over.&quot;

<P>&quot;Your co-ordinates,&quot; Kennon snapped.
&quot;Over.&quot;

<P>&quot;280.45--67.29 plus. Repeat -- request your
identification.&quot;

<P>&quot;Pilot Kennon, Jac, Beta 47M 26429. I have no I.D. for
the ship -- and you'll see why when I land. Over.&quot;

<P>&quot;Hunterstown Port to Kennon. You are not -- repeat not -
cleared to land. Go into orbit and report your position.
Over.&quot;

<P>&quot;Sorry, Hunterstown. You wouldn't have checked in if you
didn't have room, and a hospital. This is an emergency. I'm
setting down. Out.&quot;

<P>&quot;But--&quot; The words got no farther. Kennon was already
spinning the ship.

<P>&quot;All right -- we have you on the scope. But this is a
class one violation. You may come in on Landing Beam One.&quot;

<P>&quot;Sorry. I have no GCA.&quot;

<P>&quot;What? -- what sort of ship are you flying?&quot; The
voice was curious.

<P>&quot;I'm matching intrinsics over your port. Talk me in when
I break through the overcast.&quot;

<P>&quot;Talk you in?&quot;

<P>&quot;That's right. My instruments are obsolete.&quot;

<P>&quot;Great Halstead! What else?&quot;

<P>&quot;I have an Ion drive. Plus two radioactive.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh no! -- And you still want to come in?&quot;

<P>&quot;I have to. My passenger's in shock. She's going to have
a baby.&quot;

<P>&quot;All right -- I'll try to get you down in one
piece.&quot;

<P>&quot;Have an ambulance ready,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>Kennon lowered the Egg through the overcast. Ground control
picked him up smoothly and took him down as though it had been
rehearsed. The Egg touched down in the radioactive area of the
port. Decontamination jets hissed, sluicing the ship to remove
surface contamination.

<P>&quot;Ochsner! what sort of a ship is that?&quot; Ground
Control's startled voice came over the annunciator.

<P>&quot;It's an old one,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;That's a gross understatement. Stand by for boarders.
Ambulance coming up.&quot;

<P>Kennon opened the airlock and two radiation-suited men
entered. &quot;At least you had sense enough to wear protective
clothing in this hotbox,&quot; one said as they carefully
unwebbed Copper and carried her out of the lock. &quot;You wait
here. The Port Captain wants to see you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Where are you taking her? What Center?&quot; Kennon
asked.

<P>&quot;What should you care? You've nearly killed her. The idea
of taking a pregnant woman up in this death trap! What in
Fleming's name's the matter with your brain?&quot;

<P>&quot;I had to,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;I had to. It was a
matter of life and death.&quot; For once, he thought wryly, the
cliche was true.

<P>The Betan's face behind the transparent helmet was disgusted
and unbelieving. &quot;I hear that sort of thing every day,&quot;
he said. &quot;Am I supposed to believe it?&quot;

<P>&quot;You'd believe it if you'd have been where I was,&quot;
Kennon muttered. &quot;Now -- whe're are you taking her?&quot; he
demanded.

<P>The man arched blond eyebrows. &quot;To the local Medical
Center -- where else? There's only one in this area.&quot;

<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>He watched the ambulance flit off as he waited for the
Spaceport Patrol. There was no further need for the protection
suit, so he peeled it off and hung it in the control-room locker.
Copper was right, he mused. It did itch.

<P>The Port Captain's men were late as usual  - moving gingerly
through the radiation area. A noncom gestured for him to enter
their carryall. &quot;Port Captain wants to see you,&quot; he
said.

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; Kennon replied.

<P>&quot;You should have waited upstairs.&quot;

<P>&quot;I couldn't. It was a matter of medicine,&quot; Kennon
said.

<P>The noncom's face sobered. &quot;Why didn't you say so? All
you said was that it was an emergency.&quot;

<P>&quot;I've been away. I forgot.&quot;

<P>&quot;You shouldn't have done that. You're a Betan, aren't
you?&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded.

<P>They drove to the Port Office, where Kennon expected - and got
-- a bad time from the port officials. He filled out numerous
forms, signed affidavits, explained his unauthorized landing,
showed his spaceman's ticket, defended his act of piloting
without an up-to-date license, signed more forms, entered a claim
for salvage rights to the Egg, and finally when the Legal
Division, the Traffic Control Division, the Spaceport Safety
Office, Customs, Immigration, and Travelers Aid had finished with
him, he was ushered into the presence of the Port Captain.

<P>The red-faced chunky officer eyed him with a cold stare.
&quot;You'll be lucky, young man, if you get out of this with a
year in Correction. Your story doesn't hang together.&quot;

<P>It didn't, Kennon thought. But there was no sense telling all
of it to a Port Captain. Under no circumstances could the man be
any help to him. He had neither the power nor the prestige to
request a Brotherhood Board of Inquiry. In rank, he was hardly
more than a glorified Traffic Control officer. It would do no
good to tell him an improbable tale of slavery on a distant
planet. The only thing to do was wait out the storm and hope it
would pass. If worst came to worst he'd use his rank, but he'd
made enough stir already. He doubted if the Captain had authority
to order him into Detention -- but he was certain to get a
lecture. These minor officials loved to tell someone off. He
gritted his teeth. He'd endure it for Copper's sake -- and to get
out of here quietly. Alexander would undoubtedly have agents
posted by now, and his only chance for temporary freedom of
action was to get out of here with as little fuss as possible.

<P>He sat quietly, his flushed face and tight jaw muscles
betraying his impatience as the Captain paced up and down and
talked on and on. The man sounded like he could go for hours.
With increasing impatience Kennon listened to the cadenced flow
of complaint and condemnation, occasionally inserting a
&quot;Yes, sir&quot; or &quot;Sorry, sir&quot; or &quot;No,
sir&quot; as the words flowed around him.

<P>However, there had to be a breaking point somewhere, and the
monotony was beginning to wear his temper thin. Another five
minutes, he reflected, was about all he could take.

<P>The door chime rang softly.

<P>&quot;Come in,&quot; the Port Captain said, breaking off in
mid-tirade. The change in his manner was so abrupt that Kennon
couldn't help smiling.

<P>A young blond man in an interne's gray uniform entered the
room.

<P>&quot;Yes, Doctor,&quot; the Port Captain said. &quot;What can
I do for you?&quot;

<P>&quot;Do you have a Jac Kennon here? Dr. Jac Kennon?&quot;

<P>&quot;Did you say <I>doctor?</I>&quot; the Port Captain said
in a half-strangled voice.

<P>&quot;You never let me tell you,&quot; Kennon said mildly,
&quot;that my landing here was a matter of medicine. Technically
you have contributed to a delay in treatment.&quot;

<P>The Port Captain's face paled. &quot;Why didn't you say
something?&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;Against your gale of wind I would be but a faint
breeze,&quot; Kennon said coldly. He turned to the interne. 'Tm
Dr. Kennon.&quot; They bowed formally to each other.

<P>&quot;I'm Smalley, sir, from the medical center. Dr. Brainard
sends his compliments and requests that you join him for
consultation.&quot;

<P>&quot;The Port Captain--&quot; Kennon began.

<P>&quot;Don't worry about it, Doctor. I'll relinquish
responsibility to Dr. Brainard,&quot; the Captain said.

<P>&quot;I have placed a formal written request with your
office,&quot; Smalley said stiffly. &quot;You are relieved of
further charge. Dr. Kennon is urgently needed. It is a matter of
medicine.&quot;

<P>The Captain looked relieved. On Beta it was poor policy to
interfere with the doings of doctors and engineers -- or even
doctors of philosophy.

<P>&quot;Very well. He's yours -- and I'm glad to be rid of
him.&quot; The Port Captain bowed to Kennon and Smalley and
stalked out of the office.

<P>&quot;Pompous little man,&quot; Kennon observed, &quot;but he
certainly can talk.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh -- you know these Administrative people,&quot; the
interne said depreciatingly. &quot;One mustn't mind them. They're
necessary nuisances.&quot; He eyed Kennon curiously. &quot;How is
it that you didn't stand on your professional rights?&quot;

<P>&quot;I have my reasons -- but they have nothing to do with
medicine.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh -- I see. Ethical.&quot; The interne's voice was
faintly sarcastic.

<P>&quot;Manners, Doctor -- manners.&quot; Kennon's voice was
gentle but the interne flushed a dull red.

<P>&quot;Sorry, sir.&quot;

<P>&quot;Don't mention it. It's normal for a graduate to confuse
liberty with license.&quot; Kennon smiled. &quot;Don't worry. I
shan't report you.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's good of you, sir.&quot; Smalley's face registered
relief. Demerits were difficult to erase -- particularly ones of
courtesy.

<P>Kennon wondered if the young man would report himself. He
doubted it. The interne didn't look the type -- probably he was
dated for some obscure job, like a general practitioner. He
shrugged. It took all kinds to make a profession. Even the
Smalleys had their place.

<P>&quot;That girl you brought in,&quot; Smalley said as they
entered a white car emblazoned with the three crosses, red, blue,
and green, that represented the three fields of medicine.
&quot;She's an interesting case. I've never seen space shock
before. And the patient herself -- one would hardly believe she
was a Betan.&quot;

<P>&quot;She isn't,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;So?&quot; Blond eyebrows rose in inverted U's of
surprise. &quot;But that's hardly possible. Our tests
indicate-&quot;

<P>&quot;Don't you think that this is a matter for Dr.
Brainard?&quot; Kennon said icily. &quot;Protocol--&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course. Stupid of me -- but the case is so
interesting. Half the center staff have seen her already. I
wasn't proposing to discuss the case. It wouldn't be proper. Even
though you are only a veterinarian.&quot;

<P>&quot;Only?&quot; Kennon's voice was hard. &quot;I shouldn't
have to remind you of this, <I>Mr.</I> Smalley -- but I have been
for the past two years on a world of bad manners. I expected
better here at home.&quot;

<P>Smalley flushed to the roots of his straw-colored hair.
&quot;Sorry, Doctor,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I don't know what's
the matter with me.&quot;

<P>&quot;I can tell you,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;You've just
graduated.&quot;

<P>&quot;How did you know?&quot; Smalley said.

<P>&quot;I was a graduate once, myself -- not too long ago.&quot;

<P>&quot;How long, sir?&quot;

<P>&quot;Class of Eighty-seven.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's twelve years ago,&quot; Smalley said.

<P>Kennon nodded. Ten years lost. Not bad -- not bad at all. But
Alexander could have done a lot in ten years.

<P>&quot;I meant no disrespect,&quot; Smalley said worriedly.

<P>&quot;I know it. But if you intend to practice on Beta, you'd
better polish your professional manner. Now where I was, it
didn't make much difference. Laymen often called me 'Doc.'&quot;

<P>Smalley was properly shocked. &quot;I hope you didn't
encourage them, sir.&quot;

<P>&quot;It was impossible to discourage them,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;After all, when the man who hires you----&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh -- entrepreneurs,&quot; Smalley said in a tone that
explained everything.

<P>* * *

<P>The car stopped in front of the Medical Center's staff
entrance. &quot;This way, sir,&quot; Smalley said. He led the way
down a green-tiled corridor to an elevator -- then down another
corridor past a pair of soft-footed nurses who eyed them
curiously -- looking at Kennon's tunic and sandals with mild
disapproval in their eyes. Smalley stopped and knocked softly on
a closed door.

<P>&quot;Enter,&quot; said a pleasant baritone voice from the
annunciator.

<P>&quot;Dr. Brainard -- Dr. Kennon,&quot; Smalley said.

<P>Kennon liked the man instantly. A plump, pink-cheeked man of
middle age, with prematurely white hair, Dr. Will Brainard
combined a fatherly appearance with an impression of quick
intelligence. The fat that sheathed his stocky body had obviously
not touched his mind. Brainard rose from the deep chair near the
window where he had been sitting, knocked the ashes from his
pipe, and bowed stiffly. His eyes -- sharp points of blue in the
smooth pinkness of his face - surveyed Kennon curiously.

<P>&quot;So you're the young man who takes untrained pregnant
women for rides in old-fashioned spacers,&quot; he said.
&quot;Didn't you know what would happen?&quot;

<P>&quot;I was in a hurry, Doctor,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;Obviously. Now tell me about it.&quot; Brainard looked
at the eager-faced interne standing behind Kennon. &quot;That
will be all, Smalley,&quot; he said.

<P>Kennon waited until the door closed. &quot;Ordinarily,&quot;
he said, &quot;I'd never have done a thing like that, but there
were some very pressing reasons. However, I should have given her
an injection of Somnol before we started. I'm criminally liable.
If anything happens to her----&quot; His voice was tight with
worry.

<P>&quot;You'd give <I>her</I> an injection?&quot; Brainard said.
&quot;I hope you didn't mean that.&quot;

<P>&quot;But I did, sir. I've given thousands of Lani
injections.&quot;

<P>&quot;What's a Lani?&quot;

<P>&quot;She is, sir. The impression has been that her race isn't
human.&quot;

<P>&quot;Nonsense -- it's obvious she is.&quot;

<P>&quot;A Brotherhood Court of Inquiry didn't think so.&quot;

<P>&quot;Hmm. Is that so?&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes, sir. -- But before I go on, tell me, how is
she?&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh, she'll be fine. A little mental therapy and plenty
of rest are all she needs. She's a remarkably healthy young
woman. But this is beside the point. There are a number of
unusual features about this case that need investigation.&quot;
Brainard took a standard hospital form from his desk. &quot;Mind
if I ask you some questions, Doctor?&quot;

<P>&quot;Not at all but you are due for some unpleasant shocks as
you go through that form.&quot;

<P>&quot;I believe I can survive them,&quot; Brainard said dryly.

<P>&quot;This is professional confidence---&quot; Kennon began.

<P>&quot;Of course, of course,&quot; Brainard said impatiently.
&quot;Now let's get on with it.&quot;

<P>* * *

<P>&quot;This is the most amazing tale I've ever heard,&quot;
Brainard said slowly. &quot;Are you certain you are telling the
truth?&quot;

<P>Kennon grinned. &quot;I don't blame you for not believing me
-- but the evidence is conclusive, and there is enough
documentary evidence in the space ship -- and in the fact of the
ship itself to prove what I am saying. Laboratory tests here will
establish the fact that Copper's child is also mine. And as for
Flora, a Brotherhood Investigation Team can prove that
part.&quot;

<P>&quot;That will be attended to,&quot; Brainard said grimly.

<P>&quot;But how did you deduce she wasn't from a Betan
colony?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>Brainard smiled. &quot;That wasn't hard. Her sun tan and the
condition of her feet proved she was a practicing nudist. No
Betan girl ever practices nudism to my knowledge. Besides, the
I.D. tattoo under her left arm and the V on her hip are no marks
of our culture. Then there was another thing -- the serological
analysis revealed no gerontal antibodies. She had never received
an injection of longevity compound in her life. This might occur,
but it's highly improbable. The evidence indicates that she's
extra-Betan.&quot;

<P>Kennon nodded.

<P>&quot;But this business of her being fifteen years old! That's
impossible. She has the development of a woman of
twenty-five.&quot;

<P>&quot;Remember the Alpha V colony?&quot; Kennon said.

<P>


<P>&quot;Of course -- oh -- I see! It could be something like
that. Certainly -- strong yellow G-type sun -- an isolated colony
serviced at twenty-year intervals -- there was a marked physical
precocity.&quot;

<P>&quot;And if this had been continued for several
millennia?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Hmm -- I see. Yes, it's possible. On Alpha V the
colonists grew from infancy to maturity in fifteen years.&quot;

<P>&quot;And wasn't Heaven one of our early colonies?&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes -- it was established after the Great Schism near
the end of the First Millennium -- when science and religion
split irrevocably on this world. We packed the whole lot of them
off to a world of their own where they could develop as they
pleased. They called it Heaven -- odd name for a fogworld - but
there's no accounting for tastes.&quot; Brainard chuckled.

<P>&quot;I thought that was the case, but I couldn't remember. My
ancient history is pretty weak.&quot;

<P>&quot;You should read more,&quot; Brainard said. &quot;But as
I see it -- this girl is of Betan ancestry providing your theory
and the facts coincide.&quot;

<P>&quot;Which could also explain why an outworld species of
agerone would be toxic. They tried to prolong Lani life and met
with failure. Our plants are mutant forms.&quot;

<P>&quot;Just as we are a mutant race,&quot; Brainard said,
&quot;or partly mutant.&quot; He sighed. &quot;You have brought
us a great deal of trouble, Kennon. You are bringing matters to a
head. If our investigations prove your statements, we are morally
bound to open the Lani question. And if those people are of Betan
origin -- that fellow Alexander will have plenty to answer
for.&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't believe it is really his fault,&quot; Kennon
said slowly. &quot;I don't think he has ever known the
truth.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why didn't you tell him?&quot;

<P>&quot;The answer to that should be obvious. Even though I
trusted him completely, I could never be sure. He has a Free
Trader background and those people can't he trusted where money's
concerned. The whole Kardonian culture is an outgrowth of Free
Traderism: small business, independent corporation, linear
trusts, and all the cutthroat competition such a culture would
naturally have. It's a regular jungle of Free Enterprise. I
couldn't predict how he would react. He could either act in a
moral manner and make restitution, or he could quietly cut our
throats and go on with his business.&quot;

<P>&quot;I see. The temptation to cut a throat might be
overwhelming.&quot;

<P>&quot;They fight commercial wars,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;Disgusting -- utterly uncivilized! Under the
circumstances you had no other course. Still, they have no moral
right to enslave human beings.&quot;

<P>&quot;There is always the element of doubt. Maybe they didn't
know. After all, an impartial court declared the Lani alien - and
the Betan mutation isn't known throughout the Brotherhood.&quot;

<P>&quot;One doesn't go around broadcasting data on the
variations of one's germ plasm,&quot; Brainard said. &quot;That's
a private affair - a matter of personal privacy.&quot;

<P>&quot;And public safety?&quot;

<P>Brainard nodded. &quot;We're no more courageous than any other
civilization. We have no desire to borrow trouble. We are content
to leave things alone.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's the trouble,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;We're all
content to leave things alone. If I hadn't found the spaceship
I'd not have been able to lay aside my moral conditioning. And if
I had not, Copper would not have become pregnant and forced me
into these drastic actions. It's even possible that I would have
done nothing.&quot; He grimaced. &quot;And when I left
Alexander's employment mnemonic erasure would have removed all
memory of the Lani's human origin.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I
still am not certain that it wouldn't have been the wiser course.
Naturally, once I knew, I couldn't do anything else than what I
did.&quot;

<P>&quot;Naturally,&quot; Brainard said. &quot;Humanity reaches
the heights when it faces questions of moral
responsibility.&quot;

<P>&quot;To mankind,&quot; Kennon added heavily. &quot;We have a
convenient blind spot regarding our moral responsibility to other
intelligent races.&quot;

<P>&quot;A harsh fact, but true -- and who is to judge whether it
is right or wrong? We achieved dominance of Earth by our moral
responsibility to family, tribe, and nation -- and we nearly
exterminated ourselves when we forgot that this responsibility
went beyond nations and embraced all mankind. We learned that
after the Exodus. As for the other races - perhaps someday we
will learn moral responsibility for all intelligence -- but we
are not ready for that yet. That's too big a mental hurdle.&quot;
Brainard sighed. &quot;We are what we are, and we change slowly.
But we change.&quot;

<P>&quot;True enough,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;But it's hard to
be philosophical about it.&quot;

<P>&quot;You're young. Live a couple of centuries and you will
understand patience.&quot;

<P>Kennon smiled.

<P>&quot;You know,&quot; Brainard said thoughtfully,&quot;you
still have plenty of things to do.&quot;

<P>&quot;I know. I'll have to make a transcript of this
discussion, have it witnessed, and make a sealed record. I have
to arrange for the reposition of the evidence inside the Egg, and
a complete recording of the Egg itself.&quot;

<P>&quot;And to be safe you'll need several facsimiles, properly
attested. The arms of these outworld entrepreneurs are long, and
unfortunately not all Betans are models of honesty.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'd better get started then.&quot;

<P>&quot;Let me help you,&quot;Brainard said. &quot;I have a
little influence in this area - and your cause interests
me.&quot; He picked up the phone on his desk.

<P>Kennon sighed. He had found an ally.

<P>CHAPTER XIX

<P>&quot;What are you going to do with that girl?&quot; Brainard
asked.

<P>&quot;Formalize our mating as soon as she is able to get out
of bed,&quot; Kennon replied.

<P>&quot;She is an ignorant, untrained savage!&quot; Brainard
protested. &quot;You should hear the stories the nurses tell
about her!&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled. &quot;You don't have to tell me about those.
I've lived with Lani for two years. But she's not stupid.&quot;

<P>&quot;What are your plans?&quot;

<P>&quot;After we establish her humanity legally,&quot; Kennon
said, &quot;I'm going to send her to school.&quot;

<P>&quot;For twenty years?&quot;

<P>&quot;If necessary. But I don't think it will take that long.
She has some schooling.&quot;

<P>&quot;But no training -- and what of the Lani in the
meantime?&quot;

<P>&quot;I have plans for that. I'm going back to Kardon and give
Alexander a chance to make restitution. I think he is an
honorable man. Slavery may be as revolting to him as it is to any
civilized human. He deserves a chance to rectify his
grandfather's error.&quot;

<P>&quot;That is reasonable -- and in the best traditions of the
Brotherhood.&quot;

<P>&quot;Furthermore, it's practical,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;Alexander is the only one fully qualified to handle the
problems of enfranchisement. He's known the Lani all his life,
and he is an executive type. A Brotherhood committee would
probably botch the whole affair. What with colonial jurisdiction,
territorial rights, and all the legal quibbling that committees
love, the Lani would get a poor deal. And there's no reason to
wreck the lives of a couple of hundred million Kardonians because
the rightful owners of Kardon were illegally enslaved. That
happened too long ago to have any practical meaning. There are
other and better solutions.&quot;

<P>&quot;What?&quot;

<P>&quot;How should I know?&quot; Kennon asked. &quot;But I'm
sure Alexander will. That's his field.&quot;

<P>&quot;All you have to worry about is whether he'll
co-operate,&quot; Brainard said.

<P>&quot;He'll co-operate once he knows the score,&quot; Kennon
said confidently. &quot;And he'll have to make some form of
restitution. But it shouldn't involve Kardon. Actually the Lani
were never in a position to develop that world. They'd probably
have remained on Flora indefinitely. The old court records showed
no tendency for their culture to expand. They were an inbred
group, a static, balanced society in harmony with their
environment. In nearly thirty-five hundred years their numbers
increased only to a few thousand. Actually there is a good
possibility that the race would ultimately have died out if Old
Alexander hadn't enslaved them and instituted a controlled
breeding program. There are more Lani alive today than there were
at the height of their power. So in a way Old Alexander did them
a favor. He kept their race alive. All we can expect is a fair
and just settlement.&quot;

<P>&quot;But if Alexander doesn't co-operate?&quot;

<P>&quot;That's where you come in. You'll be a watchdog. If you
don't receive annual progress reports from me -- and see or talk
to me personally every second year, you are released from our
bond and can do what you wish with the evidence I've
accumulated.&quot;

<P>&quot;We'd better get this into Private Record,&quot; Brainard
said. &quot;We can transcribe an agreement and place it in the
Public Repository.&quot;

<P>&quot;A good idea and we'd better waste no time. Alexander
might still be looking for me -- and if he is, it's merely a
question of time before he catches up.&quot;

<P>&quot;Ten years have passed. It's doubtful. But we could keep
you here at the Center.&quot;

<P>Kennon shook his head. &quot;Too dangerous. And besides it
would compromise you. No -- we'll get everything possible done to
make the Lani's case airtight, and then I'll return to Kardon. It
will put our case in a better light if it ever comes to trial, if
I go back voluntarily. Anyway -- I'm morally bound to return. Now
let's make this record.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's your decision,&quot; Brainard said. &quot;And it's
your neck - but I must admit that I agree with you.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'll feel safer when we get the legal details
clarified,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;And what of the girl?&quot;

<P>&quot;Can you take care of her if I have to leave
quickly?&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course. I'll give her personal attention, and after
she has her child I'll see that she is sent to you.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's decent of you, Doctor.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's my moral responsibility,&quot; Brainard said as he
slipped a new tape into the recorder.

<P>* * *

<P>Copper responded quickly to rest and therapy. The space shock
cleared up quickly. The gerontological treatments put her to bed
again, but within a month she was completely normal, and her
lifespan was now that of a normal human. She could look forward
to some four hundred years with Kennon -- and the prospect was
not unpleasant. The Center fascinated her. Never before had she
seen a hospital devoted to the care and treatment of humans. It
was a far cry, in its polished steel and stone magnificence, from
the tiny primitive structure over which Kennon had presided. Yet
both places served the same purpose. Perhaps Kennon was right --
that there was no difference between man and Lani. The idea was
not nearly as unbelievable as it was at first.

<P>&quot;I never realized what it meant to be human,&quot; Copper
said as she held Kennon's hand. &quot;It is nice to feel
important and to know that our child is a member of the race that
rules the galaxy.&quot;

<P>&quot;So you're convinced?&quot; Kennon chuckled.

<P>&quot;The serological identity--&quot; she began.

<P>&quot;Hmm. You've been getting some education, I see.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Copper smiled, &quot;I didn't think you
wanted a stupid woman. I can read -- and since you are around so
seldom nowadays, there is little else to do. I've been reading
history, medicine, and novels,&quot; she finished proudly.

<P>&quot;A fine catholic selection,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;Now
if you add mathematics, sociology, and philosophy you'll have a
well-rounded basic education.&quot;

<P>&quot;Dr. Brainard has been trying something he calls 'hypno.'
He says it will help me learn faster. But I can't see that it's
done much good.&quot;

<P>&quot;You won't until you need the information,&quot; Kennon
said.

<P>&quot;That technique is only good for implanting basic
knowledge, and much of that will merely supplement or complete
that which you already have. You won't be conscious of it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh -- I think I see what you mean.&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course, you'll have to continue your formal
education. There's a great deal for you to learn. It should keep
you busy while I'm away.&quot;

<P>&quot;Away? Where are you going?&quot;

<P>&quot;Back to Kardon.&quot;

<P>&quot;But you can't! Alexander will destroy you.&quot;

<P>&quot;I think not. After all, ten years have elapsed since we
left there and he's had plenty of time to think. Douglas must
have told him about us. I wouldn't be surprised if he has already
done something about your people.&quot;

<P>She shivered. &quot;He might -- but the question is what would
he do? He could have killed them all!&quot;

<P>Kennon shook his head. &quot;I don't think so. He never struck
me as a mass murderer.&quot;

<P>She shook her head. &quot;You don't know the Alexanders like I
do. I was raised by them. They're capable of anything. But what
is this business of ten years? That's silly. I haven't had my
child yet -- and it doesn't take ten years of pregnancy to
produce a baby.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's the difference between subjective and objective
time,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;We traveled here through
hyperspace -- low Cth -- in an uncompensated ship, and there is
little temporal flow in the levels below the blue.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh -- of course.&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled. &quot;That would have been Greek to you a
couple of weeks ago. See where that basic data fits?&quot;

<P>&quot;But I've always known that.&quot;

<P>&quot;You just think you have. Search your memory and see if
I'm not right.&quot;

<P>Copper shook her head. &quot;It's very strange,&quot; she
said. &quot;But that's not important. This idea of going back to
Kardon, though -- that's a different thing -- that is
important.&quot;

<P>&quot;I have to do it. Not only because it's a personal moral
obligation but also because of the Lani. They must have their
freedom.&quot;

<P>&quot;Providing there are any still alive.&quot;

<P>&quot;Stop being a calamity howler. Whatever Alexander may be,
he's not a butcher. He even loved a Lani once. You told me so
yourself. And he couldn't kill where he loved.&quot;

<P>She nodded. &quot;I suppose you're right, but I've never lost
my fear of the Man Alexander. He held the power of life and death
over me. But if you must go then I should go too. My obligation
is greater than yours.&quot;

<P>&quot;Later,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;You're not ready to
return. It will be time enough after you have learned some
civilized habits.&quot;

<P>Copper's face lengthened. &quot;You mean like wrapping myself
in cloth like these people do?&quot;

<P>&quot;That's part of it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why can't they be sensible -- or are they so ashamed of
what the gods gave them that they must hide themselves?&quot;

<P>&quot;No, it's not that. At least not exactly. It's custom.
And you must learn to conform to customs -- outwardly at least --
no matter what you may really think.&quot;

<P>&quot;Isn't that a form of lying?&quot; Copper asked.

<P>&quot;I suppose so.&quot;

<P>&quot;Isn't that strange. Your society exalts truth, honor,
morality, and intelligence -- yet you lie about your
attitude.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's called diplomacy,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;It's
part of respect for others' attitudes and beliefs, a necessary
part of human relationships.&quot;

<P>&quot;Then you'd be a nudist on Santos?&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course -- even though I think it isn't proper, I
couldn't inflict my ideas and attitudes on the customs of an
independent world.&quot;

<P>&quot;Oh -- you think I'm doing that?&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes -- and it is a mark of barbarism.&quot;

<P>&quot;Sometimes you're not very nice,&quot; Copper said.

<P>Kennon smiled wryly. &quot;I suppose I'm not,&quot; he agreed.

<P>&quot;I'll try to be civilized,&quot; Copper said. &quot;But
if you go to Kardon -- I'm going with you.&quot;

<P>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;We'll see how things
turn out.&quot;

<P>&quot;You don't want me to go with you?&quot;

<P>&quot;To be honest -- no,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;You're safe
here, and until your status is cleared by a Brotherhood court, I
wouldn't care to place you in Alexander's hands. And clearing
your status is going to take time.&quot;

<P>&quot;You mean that I am still his property?&quot;

<P>&quot;Yes. But there is a legal doubt that will prevent him
from exercising his claim as long as you stay on Beta. In the
area where he has power, that doubt might not hold. So until your
status is definitely proven to be human, you should not
leave.&quot;

<P>&quot;And what happens if this court denies my claim?&quot;

<P>&quot;Then we appeal to the Council. However, with the
evidence we have, your claim cannot reasonably be denied. The
only question is one of time. It may take years. Still, I don't
think there is anything to worry about. I don't think Alexander
will give us any trouble, but there's no sense in taking
chances.&quot;

<P>&quot;You still think I'm a Lani,&quot; she said accusingly.

<P>&quot;I do not.&quot;

<P>&quot;Then you think that I'd obey Alexander, after what I did
to Douglas.&quot;

<P>&quot;I can only repeat that Douglas isn't the Boss-man.&quot;

<P>&quot;I wish I knew what you really thought.&quot;

<P>&quot;That isn't hard. I think you should stay here until I
get this business straightened out.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's all?&quot; she asked suspiciously. &quot;After
all, I know I'm not very pretty now. And there's lots of Lani on
Flora----&quot;

<P>Oh, for Ochsner's sake! Do you think that I'm---&quot; He
paused, speechless. &quot;Just what do you think I am?&quot;

<P>&quot;You're a man. And that's the trouble.&quot;

<P>Kennon chuckled. &quot;So that's it! You don't trust me.&quot;

<P>&quot;I love you,&quot; Copper said.

<P>&quot;Sometimes I wonder why men ever finalize their status
with women,&quot; Kennon murmured. &quot;It does no good. It
doesn't convince the woman. She's still fearful, jealous, and
suspicious -- always belittling her ability to hold what she has,
always alert for competition, clinging, holding, absorbing --
when she should be working as part of a team.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's not true!&quot;

<P>&quot;Then prove it.&quot;

<P>&quot;How -- by staying here while you go to the end of the
galaxy and play noble?&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm only doing what I have to do.&quot;

<P>&quot;And so am I -- and if you go I'm going with you&quot;

<P>Kennon shrugged. There was no sense arguing. The only thing to
do was make his plans and leave quietly. If she was faced with an
established fact, she might be more reasonable. He doubted it,
but alone, she could do nothing -- and Brainard would see that
she was comfortable. The salvage money from the Egg would keep
her from being a public charge. And he had more banked in
Albertsville which he could send her once he got there. He'd
start making plans to leave as soon as possible.

<P>Copper looked up at him as he stood above her bed. Slowly she
reached out and placed one slim hand in his. &quot;I know what
you are thinking,&quot; she said, &quot;and--&quot; her face
twisted in a grimace of pain, and the hand in his clutched with
convulsive strength at his fingers.

<P>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;Nothing -- it's perfectly normal,&quot; she said.
&quot;I'm just going to give you a son. Now if you'd call for the
doctor, perhaps we can get this over. That pain was only twenty
minutes from the last. I think it's about time.&quot;

<P>Kennon -- who had attended several hundred Lani births and had
developed a certain callousness about them -- was suddenly
frightened and helpless as he pushed the call button. He could
feel the cold sweat form on his forehead. He had started this. It
was his fault if anything went wrong. He wished that it was
someone else rather than Copper who was going through this trial.
He was nervous, unsure, and guilty. In a word, he felt like a man
whose mate was giving birth to their first child.

<P>* * *

<P>&quot;It's a boy,&quot; Dr. Bra!nard said. He smiled down at
Kennon's haggard face.

<P>&quot;How is Copper?&quot; Kennon asked.

<P>&quot;Fine -- she's healthy as a horse.&quot;

<P>Kennon winced at the cliche It was so ancient that it had lost
all meaning. Most Betans didn't know what a horse was, let alone
whether it was healthy or not. From what Kennon could remember of
veterinary history, the horse wasn't too healthy an animal. It
was rather delicate, in fact.

<P>&quot;How is the child?&quot; Kennon asked. It took a little
courage to ask this question. The baby could be anything from
normal to a monstrosity.

<P>&quot;Perfectly normal,&quot; Brainard said. &quot;A true
Betan type even down to the vestigial tail. We amputated that, of
course.&quot;

<P>&quot;Thank Ochsner!&quot; Kennon breathed. &quot;I was
afraid.&quot;

<P>&quot;Of course you were,&quot; Brainard said. &quot;Do you
want to see them now? When I left, Copper was asking for
you.&quot;

<P>Kennon sighed. Leaving, he realized, wasn't going to be as
easy as he had thought.

<P>&quot;We'll have to keep them here for a couple of
months,&quot; Brainard said. &quot;We must take exhaustive tests
if we expect the court to reverse its prior decision.&quot;

<P>&quot;I expected that,&quot; Kennon said. He shrugged,
&quot;It's probably best,&quot; he said. &quot;Now show me where
Copper is.&quot;

<P>&quot;She's back in the same room. You don't need a
guide.&quot;

<P>Kennon didn't. In fact, he behaved quite admirably.

<P>CHAPTER XX

<P>Longliners, Kennon reflected, didn't make Beta a port of call,
and the Shortliner connections with other worlds were
'infrequent. Beta had done a good job separating from the rest of
the Brotherhood. Too good. The spaceline schedules showed only
one departure in the next month, a Shortliner for Earth, and from
Earth the road to Kardon was long and tortuous, involving a
series of short jumps from world to world and a final
medium-range hop from Halsey to Kardon. If everything went right
and he made every connection he would be in Kardon four months
after he left Beta. Kennon sighed as he left Travelers Aid.
Morality was a heavy load to carry.

<P>He walked slowly down the road from the spaceport toward the
Co-operative where he had been staying. He had left Huntersville
and Copper a week ago, after he had seen his child. His child!
The thought of being a father was oddly dismaying. It distorted
his sense of values. But one thing was certain. He was returning
to Kardon, and Copper was not coming with him. She had a duty to
their son - and he had a duty to his contract with Alexander, to
the Lani on Flora, and to Copper -- and none of these could be
satisfied by further running. He had to return and settle the
account.

<P>A tall man in a conservative yellow-and-black suit was waiting
patiently in front of his room. &quot;My name is Richter,&quot;
he said &quot; -- Art Richter. Are you Dr. Jac Kennon?&quot;

<P>&quot;I could deny it, but I won't,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;Thank you, Doctor. It was just a formality anyway. You
see, I know you by sight.&quot; He sighed. &quot;One has to
observe the formalities in this business.&quot; He drew a long
white envelope from his tunic and handed it to Kennon. &quot;Most
of my subjects try to deny their identity,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;It's a refreshing change to find an honest man.&quot; He
bowed formally. &quot;I really thought this would be harder,
considering the charges against you.&quot; He bowed again and
walked away.

<P>&quot;Now -- what was that?&quot; Kennon muttered as he opened
the envelope. The man Richter was undoubtedly a process server --
but who had hired him? He unfolded the sheet and scanned the
charges -- coercion, larceny, livestock theft, and breach of
contract. He shrugged. This was Alexander's work. What was the
man thinking of? It was insanity to bring the Lani matter into
open court. Hadn't Douglas told him what had happened? Couldn't
Alexander guess that he had fled with Copper for a good reason --
one that would stand up in court? Didn't he know about the
spacer? Or had Douglas turned on his cousin? The pup had so many
hates that it was possible. He was a natural troublemaker. Maybe
Alexander didn't know. Maybe he was working in the dark. Kennon
scanned the sheet quickly. Ah! here it was. Complaint - Mr.
Alexander X. M. Alexander, Skyline Tower 1024, Beta City!

<P>Alexander! Here on Beta! Kennon opened the door of his room,
went straight to the phone beside the bed. He lifted the handset
from its cradle and dialed the operator. &quot;Get me
Huntersville THU 2-1408. I want to speak to Dr. Brainard, Dr.
Will Brainard. This is a priority call -- my name is Kennon. Dr.
Jac Kennon D.V.M. I'm in the registry -- 47M 26429 -- yes -- of
course, and thank you.&quot; He waited a moment. &quot;Hello --
Dr. Brainard? -- Kennon here. I've just had some news.
Alexander's on Beta! Yes -- he served me with a summons. Can you
get a restraining order to prevent him from leaving? You can?
Good! Here's his address.&quot; Kennon rattled off the location.
&quot;Yes -- I'm taking the next airboat to Beta City. This
should simplify things considerably. -- Of course it should. He
was a fool to have come here. Yes -- I suppose you should tell
Copper. Oh! She is? I'm sorry to hear that, but there's no reason
for her to be angry. She should realize that I did this for her
-- not to make her miserable. Hmm.-- She -- she has? You think
she should come with me? -- Yes, I realize she can be a problem
when she wants to be. All right then -- tell her to pack a
toothbrush and a few spare diapers. And see if you can get me a
couple of tickets on the next flight to Beta City. I'll be over
in a couple of hours and pick her up.&quot; He cradled the phone
and dialed the operator again.

<P>&quot;I want the phone number of Skyline Tower 1024, Beta
City, Mr. Alexander. Yes. I'll wait. This number is HUV 2-1278
and my name is Kennon, Dr. Jac Kennon 47M 26429. I called you
before. No, I'm a transient. I can refer you to Dr. James
Brainard, Huntersville Medical Center. Yes, I'll accept charges.
Now will you give me that number? BCA 7-8941--thank you.&quot;

<P>Kennon hung up, dialed the number, and waited.

<P>&quot;Hello,&quot; he said. &quot;Mr. Alexander? This is Dr.
Kennon. - Yes -- I suppose you do, but I've been trying to get
back to Kardon for the past month. You are? Well, that's your
privilege, but I'd advise you to go easy until I see you.
Naturally -- I'm coming as soon as I can get there. We'll be
seeing you tomorrow morning at the latest. We? -- I'm bringing
Copper, of course. I just wanted you to know.&quot;

<P>Kennon wiped his forehead. Alexander sounded angry and
dangerous. Ten years hadn't served to cool him off. What had
happened on Kardon after he had left? Kennon shook his head.
There was something here he didn't understand. The entrepreneur
should have been covering his tracks, not threatening jail and
disaccreditation. It was obvious that a personal visit was more
necessary than he had thought.

<P>Alexander was waiting. His eyebrows rose at the sight of
Copper in formal Betan dress -- and lifted a trifle more at the
sight of the baby.

<P>&quot;What is this, Kennon?&quot; he asked.

<P>&quot;Trouble,&quot; Kennon said. He took off his hat. &quot;I
came here to settle things before you took this case to court.
You obviously do not understand what has happened. I suppose
Douglas has double-crossed you. It would be characteristic of
him. But before we go any further I think we should clear the air
and let each other know where we stand. I don't want to make
trouble if it's not necessary. You'll notice I'm not wearing a
thought screen, so you'll be able to check everything I say, and
know I'm telling the truth.&quot;

<P>&quot;It had better be good,&quot; Alexander said grimly.
&quot;I've been looking for you for ten years. I intend to throw
the book at you.&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't know whether my reason is good or not.
Technically I'm guilty of breach of contract and larceny of
corporation property, but there are extenuating
circumstances.&quot;

<P>Alexander chuckled mirthlessly. &quot;There are a few other
charges. And quite probably I can think of more if you beat
these. I'm going to make an example of you, Kennon. I'm going to
drag you down and stamp on you. You're going to be a horrible
example to all smart operators who think they can break
contracts. It's taken a million credits and ten years' time to
hunt you down, but it's going to be worth it.&quot;

<P>&quot;Copper's child is a boy,&quot; Kennon said mildly.
&quot;My son.&quot;

<P>Alexander froze. &quot;You can prove that?&quot; he asked in a
half-strangled voice.

<P>Kennon nodded. &quot;You see the extenuating
circumstance?&quot; he asked. &quot;Suppression of human
slavery!&quot;

<P>Alexander sat down. It was as though some unseen hand had
pulled his legs from under him. &quot;You believe it,&quot; he
said. &quot;-- No -- you've proved it! Why -- why didn't you tell
me? What sort of a man do you think I am?&quot;

<P>&quot;I didn't know. I couldn't take the chance until Copper
was protected. You see, sir, I love her.&quot;

<P>&quot;That isn't hard to do with Lani,&quot; Alexander said.
He sank back in his chair, his face clouded, his expression
troubled. It was obvious that the realization shocked him.

<P>Kennon felt an odd sympathy for the entrepreneur. It wasn't a
nice feeling, he suspected, to have the beliefs of a lifetime
ripped apart and sent to the disposal chute.

<P>&quot;So the Lani are a human variant,&quot; Alexander said
dully.

<P>&quot;The proof is here,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;and the
supporting evidence is conclusive.&quot;

<P>&quot;Which makes me -- what? A murderer? A slaver? A
tyrant?&quot; Alexander clutched his head with lean-fingered
hands. &quot;What am I?&quot;

<P>&quot;An innocent victim of circumstances,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;You didn't know. None of us knew. And we still wouldn't
know if the Lani weren't of Betan extraction.&quot; He grimaced
painfully. &quot;I've done some soul-searching myself, and it
hasn't been a pleasant task.&quot;

<P>&quot;But it's nothing like mine,&quot; Alexander said in a
low voice. &quot;I suspected they were human when I was younger,
but I denied my suspicions and accepted false facts instead of
investigating.&quot;

<P>&quot;You would have found nothing.&quot;

<P>&quot;Unfortunately, that's not true. We discovered quite a
bit from the experimental station you left us when you
disappeared ten years ago. But we stopped when we found the age
that was being indoctrinated with Lani tabus. We could have gone
farther, but I didn't think it was necessary.&quot;

<P>&quot;Didn't Douglas tell you?&quot; Kennon asked curiously.
&quot;I told him when I turned him loose.&quot;

<P>&quot;Douglas didn't tell anything except that you had somehow
gotten a spaceship. I assumed it was one of those that were
involved in that commercial raid a few decades ago, but I see it
wasn't. No -- I knew nothing about this development. And Douglas,
I guess, wanted to keep it hidden. He gave your co-ordinates and
ordered Mullins to launch a missile. But he apparently forgot to
turn on his IFF. At any rate the missile lost you -- but found
Douglas. Douglas was still talking to Alexandria when it
struck.&quot;

<P>&quot;He might have informed you,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;If
he had more time.&quot;

<P>&quot;I doubt it. He ordered the missile first. He was trying
to destroy you before you could destroy Outworld Enterprises.

<P>His motives were selfish as usual.&quot; Alexander looked at
Kennon with a haggard eye. &quot;I owe you an apology,&quot; he
said. &quot;I've considered you responsible for Douglas's death
for ten years. I've searched for you on a hundred worlds. My
agents in every branch office have had standing orders to report
any unusual arrivals. I have hunted you personally. I wanted to
break you -- I wanted to kill you.&quot;

<P>&quot;I couldn't help the delay,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;The
ship was old.&quot;

<P>&quot;I know. You've told me more than you think. I'm a
telepath, you know.&quot;

<P>&quot;I've never forgotten it,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;That
was one of the principal reasons I came here. I wanted to see how
you'd react when you learned the whole truth.&quot;

<P>&quot;And I suppose you gloat -- no -- you're not doing that.
But you are right. I could have checked it further. But I didn't.
Outworld Enterprises is far bigger than Flora -- and I was busy.
Galactic trade is a snake-pit. And, after all, there was
Douglas's death -- and the Family with their never-ending clamor
for money and their threats when it didn't come promptly. I like
being an entrepreneur, but until I made Outworld independent of
Family control, I couldn't do anything except run the business to
their wishes. Actually the island was only a small part of the
corporation. I tried to run it as humanely as possible under the
circumstances.'' He shuddered. &quot;I don't think I was ever
needlessly cruel.&quot;

<P>&quot;No,&quot; Kennon said, &quot;you were indifferent.&quot;

<P>&quot;Which is just as bad,&quot; Alexander said.

<P>&quot;Well -- what are you going to do about it?&quot; Copper
interjected. &quot;You can beat yourself until you're blue, but
that won't accomplish anything.&quot;

<P>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Alexander countered.
&quot;You have the upper hand.&quot;

<P>&quot;Me?&quot; Copper asked. &quot;I have nothing. This is
between you men.&quot; She lapsed into silence.

<P>Alexander turned back to Kennon. &quot;You have undoubtedly
made some arrangements. You wouldn't come here -- oh! I see.
Congratulations. Handling the evidence that way was a wise
course. You have my admiration. But then I should have known that
I was not dealing with a fool.&quot; He smiled wryly.
&quot;Subconsciously I think I did know -- but----&quot;

<P>&quot;That's one consolation,&quot; Kennon grinned. &quot;To
be thought a rascal is bad enough, but to be considered a fool is
intolerable.&quot;

<P>&quot;But your decision not to use the evidence unless you
were forced to -- that's poor business.&quot;

<P>&quot;But good morals,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;Neither the
Brotherhood nor I could settle this affair. It is a matter only
you can handle. There is no sense in killing Outworld or throwing
Kardon into centuries of litigation. The Lani never were numerous
enough to lay claim to an entire world. I'll admit the club is
there, but I'll never use it unless it's necessary.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why not? -- it's sound business practice.&quot;

<P>&quot;I'm a professional -- not a businessman. And besides, I
haven't the moral right to return evil for good. You have not
been a bad boss.&quot;

<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Alexander said glumly. &quot;I've always
considered myself civilized.&quot;

<P>&quot;I wouldn't go so far as to say that,&quot; Kennon said.
&quot;Honorable, yes -- civilized, no. But none of us are really
civilized.&quot;

<P>&quot;So?&quot;

<P>&quot;We haven't changed much, despite our development.
Perhaps we've varied a little physically -- and we've learned to
use new tools, but our minds are still the minds of barbarians --
blood brothers against the enemy, and everything not of us is
enemy. Savages -- hiding under a thin veneer of superficial
culture. Savages with spaceships and the atom.&quot; Kennon
looked down at Copper. Apparently her thoughts were miles away in
an introspective world that was all her own. She had said her
piece and having done that was content to let the two men develop
it. Kennon looked at her with odd respect. Alexander eyed her
with a mildly startled expression on his lean face. And both men
smiled, but the smiles were not amused.

<P>&quot;Judging from Copper,&quot; Alexander said, &quot;I don't
think we'll have to worry about how the Lani will turn out.&quot;
He looked at Kennon with mild sympathy. &quot;You are going to
have quite a time with her,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;I suppose so. I'll probably never know whether I'm
guided or whether I'm doing the guiding. I've changed a lot of my
opinions about Copper since the day I met her.&quot;

<P>Copper looked up and smiled at them. It was an odd smile,
hinting at secrets neither of them would ever know. Alexander
chuckled. &quot;It serves you right.&quot; He crossed his legs
and looked up at Kennon standing before him. By some uncanny
legerdemain he had gotten control of himself and the situation at
the same time. Being telepathic was an unfair advantage, Kennon
thought.

<P>&quot;You were equally unfair with your accusation,&quot;
Alexander said. &quot;Sure -- humanity makes mistakes, and like
this one they're sometimes brutal mistakes. But we are capable of
atonement. Morally we have come a long way from the brutality of
the Interregnum. I shouldn't have to use examples, but look at
that&quot; -- he waved at the view wall at the panorama of
gleaming fairy towers and greenery that made Beta City one of the
most beautiful in the Brotherhood. &quot;Don't tell me that five
thousand years of peace and development haven't produced
civilization. That's a concrete example out there.&quot;

<P>&quot;It isn't,&quot; Kennon said flatly. &quot;Sure, it's
pretty -- clean -- and beautifully designed for art and utility
-- but it isn't civilization. You're confusing technology with
culture. You look at this and say, 'What a great civilization man
has built,' when you really mean, 'What a great technology
mankind has developed.' There's all the difference in the world.
Technology is of the mind and hands. Civilization is of the
spirit -- and spiritually we are still in the Dark Ages.

<P>&quot;We conquer, kill, loot, and enslave. We establish
standards to keep humanity a closed corporation, a special club
in which men can live but aliens can't. We've made the standards
for admission so rigid that we even enslave our own kind and call
them animals. That's not civilization -- that's savagery!

<P>&quot;For nearly five hundred years your family has run a
slave pen. Your fortune is based upon it. And you have
perpetuated this traffic in flesh on the specious reasoning that
a court judgment of half a millennium ago is as good today as
when it was handed down. Never once did anyone have the moral
courage to re-examine that old decision. Never once did any human
question the rightness of that decision. None of us are immune.
We all based our conduct upon an antiquated law and searched no
further. Everyone was happy with the status quo -- or at least
not so unhappy that they wanted to change it. Even I would have
been content had it not been for Copper.&quot;

<P>&quot;Yet I do not feel that it was bad that I hired
you,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;Even though you have shown me
that I am a slaver, and made me see faults I never knew I
had.&quot; His face was drawn -- harsh lines reached from nose to
lips, from eyes to chin. Suddenly he looked old. &quot;I can
accept censure if censure is just. And this is just. No -- I'm
not sorry I hired you even though the thought of what I have
helped do to the Lani makes me sick to my stomach.&quot;

<P>&quot;Well--&quot; Kennon said. &quot;What are you going to do
about it?&quot;

<P>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;At the first
smell of trouble, the Family will turn tail and run. You can
break the company, and I won't stand in your way. It's only just.
You're the one who's carrying the ball. Now run with it.&quot;

<P>&quot;That damned blind spot,&quot; Kennon said. &quot;You
realize, of course, that you're not legally liable. It was a
mistake. All you have to do is admit the error and start from
there. Naturally -- no reasonable intelligence would expect that
you change the older Lani. They're too old for either agerone or
change. It would be both cruel and inhuman to turn them loose.
It's with the youngsters that you can work -- those who are
physically and physiologically young enough to derive benefit
from agerone and education.

<P>&quot;As I remember, you bought a planet called Phoebe. Now
why don't you----&quot;

<P>&quot;Phase out! Of course! But that means that you can't
press charges.&quot;

<P>&quot;Why should I? I'm not one of these starry-eyed reformers
who expect to change things overnight. It's the future of the
Lani race that's important, And Brainard agrees with me. A
phase-out is the proper solution. Change the education, let males
be born -- teach the young to think instead of to obey. Give them
Phoebe for a home -- they never owned all of Kardon anyway. And
within a century or two we will have a new group of the human
race -- and then we can tell the Brotherhood.&quot;

<P>Kennon looked inquiringly at Copper. She smiled and nodded.
&quot;It would cause less trouble that way,&quot; she said.
&quot;It would be more sure -- and there are never too many old
ones.&quot;

<P>Kennon shuddered, thinking of the euthanasia chambers on Otpen
One. &quot;There will be more from now on,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;Outworld can afford it. It'll bend us a little but we
won't break -- and besides, the Lani will need our help for some
time to come.&quot; Alexander looked at Kennon. &quot;Can we make
an agreement that all parties will respect?&quot; he asked.

<P>&quot;I think so -- providing there are no sleeper clauses in
it,&quot; Kennon said.

<P>&quot;There won't be,&quot; Alexander said.

<P>And there weren't.

<P>* * *

<P>It was a private ceremony. The Family, sulky and unwilling,
faced with a choice of drastically reduced income or outright
confiscation and preferring a portion of a loaf to none.
Alexander -- grim but oddly peaceful of expression. Brainard --
pink-cheeked and emotionless. Kennon and Copper -- happily
conscious that it was at last finished. It was an oddly assorted
group of conspirators who planned to restore a segment of
humanity to the human race.

<P>Kennon signed last, and as he did, Alexander looked at him
with a sly grin distorting the smooth pallor of his face.

<P>&quot;You forgot something,&quot; he said.

<P>&quot;What?&quot; Kennon said -- aware suddenly that something
was wrong.

<P>&quot;What do you plan to do, now that this is over?&quot;

<P>&quot;Join the Medical Center here and practice veterinary
medicine.&quot;

<P>&quot;You wouldn't care to work for me -- to help rebuild the
wreckage you've helped create? I'll need a manager on Kardon to
phase out the island while we phase in Phoebe.&quot;

<P>&quot;No, thank you. I've had enough of that.&quot;

<P>&quot;You just think you have,&quot; Alexander said gleefully.
&quot;That's what you have forgotten. You've gotten your
agreement -- now you will satisfy me. As I see it you have
breached your contract by leaving Flora without
authorization.&quot;

<P>&quot;That is right,&quot; Kennon said. A small lump of lead
began to grow rapidly larger in his stomach. Brainard was
grinning and Copper's eyes were shining. &quot;You've been
jobbed!&quot; his mind told him. He sighed. He knew what was
coming next.

<P>&quot;The punitive clause for breach of contract,&quot;
Alexander went on inexorably, &quot;is very broad. Discretion is
vested in the entrepreneur. I can obtain judgment against you in
any court on any planet.&quot;

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; Kennon said glumly.

<P>&quot;But I am going to be civilized,&quot; Alexander said.
&quot;I am going to be merciful. I am going to extend your
contract until phase-out has been completed. You are going to
have control of the entire Kardon phase of the operation. It's
poetic justice -- you made the mess -- now you can clean it
up.&quot;

<P>&quot;That's inhuman!&quot;

<P>&quot;Humanity has nothing to do with it. It's justice,&quot;
Alexander said. He smiled at Copper's radiant face. The thought
of going home was good to her. &quot;Good luck on your new job,
Dr. Kennon,&quot; he said. &quot;And welcome to the brotherhood
of the ulcer.&quot;
