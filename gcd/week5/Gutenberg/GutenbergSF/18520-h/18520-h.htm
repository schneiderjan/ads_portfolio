<h2><a name="CHAPTER_1" id="CHAPTER_1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>


<p>"<i>Bong-g-g! Bong-g-g! Bong-g-g!&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>With a hollow booming sound reminiscent of old
eighteenth-and nineteenth-century clock towers, the
electronic time tone rang out from the Tower of Galileo,
chiming the hour of nine. As the notes reverberated
over the vast expanse of Space Academy, U.S.A., the
lights in the windows of the cadet dormitories began to
wink out and the slidewalks that crisscrossed the campus,
connecting the various buildings, rumbled to a
halt. When the last mournful note had rolled away to
die in the distant hills, the school was dark and still.
The only movement to be seen was the slow pacing of
the cadet watch officers, patrolling their beats; the only
sound, the measured clicking of their boots on the
metal strips of the slidewalks.</p>

<p>On the north side of the quadrangle near the Tower,
a young watch officer paused in front of one of the dormitories
and scanned the darkened windows of the
durasteel and crystal building. Satisfied that all was in
order, he continued on his lonely way. A moment later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
a shadowy figure rose out of the bushes opposite the
dormitory entrance and stepped forward quickly and
cautiously. Pausing on the slidewalk to stare after the
disappearing watch officer, the figure was illuminated
by the dim light from the entrance hall. He was a
young man wearing the royal-blue uniform of a Space
Cadet. Tall and wiry, with square features topped by a
shock of close-cropped blond hair, he stood poised on
the balls of his feet, ready to move quickly should another
watch officer appear.</p>

<p>After a quick glance at his wrist chronometer, the
young cadet darted across the slidewalk toward the
transparent crystal portal of the dormitory. Hesitating
only long enough to make certain that the inner hallway
was clear, he slid the portal open, ducked inside,
and sprinted down the hall toward a large black panel
on the wall near the foot of the slidestairs. On the panel,
in five long columns, were the name plates of every cadet
quartered in the dormitory and beside each plate
were two words, IN and OUT, with a small tab that
fitted over one of the words.</p>

<p>Out of the one hundred and fifty cadets in the dormitory,
one hundred and forty-nine were marked IN. The
slender, blond-haired cadet quickly made it unanimous,
reaching up to the tab next to the name of Roger
Manning and sliding it over to cover the word OUT. With a
last final look around, he raced up the slidestairs,
smiling in secret triumph.</p>

<p>In Room 512 on the fifth floor of the dormitory, Tom
Corbett and Astro, the two other cadets who, with
Roger Manning, made up the famed <i>Polaris</i> unit of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Space Cadet Corps, were deep in their studies. Though
the lights-out order had been given over the dormitory
loud-speaker system, the desk lamp burned brightly
and there was a blanket thrown over the window. The
boys of the <i>Polaris</i> unit weren't alone in their disobedience.
All over the dormitory, lights were on and cadets
were studying secretly. But they all felt fairly safe, for
the cadet watch officers on each floor were anxious to
study themselves and turned a blind eye. Even the Solar
Guard officer of the day, in charge of the entire
dormitory, was sympathetic to their efforts and made a
great deal of unnecessary noise while on his evening
rounds.</p>

<p>His brown curly hair falling over his forehead, Tom
Corbett frowned in concentration as he kept the
earphones of his study machine clamped tightly to his ears
and listened to a recorded lecture on astrophysics as it
unreeled from the spinning study spool. As command
cadet of the <i>Polaris</i> unit, Tom was required to know
more than merely his <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'particularly'.">particular</ins> duty as pilot of a
rocket ship. He had to be familiar with every phase of
space travel, with a working knowledge of the duties of
all his unit mates.</p>

<p>Astro, the power-deck officer of the unit, paced back
and forth between the bunks like a huge, hulking bear,
muttering to himself as he tried to memorize the table
of reaction times for rocket motors. Though the huge
Venusian cadet was a genius at all mechanical tasks,
and able to work with tools the way a surgeon worked
with instruments, he had great difficulty in learning the
theories and scientific reasons for all the things he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
instinctively. Suddenly Astro stopped, looked at his
chronometer, then turned to Tom.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom!" he called. "Where's that jerk, Manning?"</p>

<p>"Huh?" replied Tom, lifting one of the earphones
from his ears. "What did you say, Astro?"</p>

<p>"Where's Manning?" reiterated Astro. "It's ten minutes
after lights out."</p>

<p>"He was going to get those study spools for us, wasn't
he?" mused Tom.</p>

<p>"He should've been back by now," grunted the Venusian.
"The library closed an hour ago. Besides, he
couldn't have gotten those spools. Every other cadet in
the Academy is after them."</p>

<p>"Well, he's a pretty resourceful joker," sighed Tom,
turning back to the study machine. "When he goes after
something, he gets it by hook or crook."</p>

<p>"It's the crook part that bothers me," grumbled Astro.
"Besides, if the O.D. catches him out of quarters, he'll
be doing his studying while he's polishing up the mess
hall."</p>

<p>Suddenly the door to the room burst open and
slammed closed. Tom and Astro whirled to see their
missing unit mate lounging against the doorframe, grinning
broadly.</p>

<p>"Roger!"</p>

<p>"Where've you been, blast you?"</p>

<p>Tom and Astro both jumped forward and spoke at
the same time. The blond-haired cadet merely looked
at them lazily and then sauntered forward, pulling six
small study spools from his pockets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"You wanted these study spools, didn't you?" he
drawled, giving his unit mates three apiece. "Be my
guest and study like mad."</p>

<p>Tom and Astro quickly read the titles of the spools
and then looked at Roger in amazement. They were the
ones the unit needed for their end-term exams, the ones
all the cadets needed.</p>

<p>"Roger," Tom demanded, "how did you get these
spools? The library was out of them this afternoon. Did
you take them from another unit's quarters?"</p>

<p>"I did not!" said Roger stoutly. "And I don't like your
insinuations that I would." He grinned. "Relax! We
have them and we can breeze through them in the
morning and have them back where they belong by
noon tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Where they belong!" Tom exclaimed. "Then you
have no right to them."</p>

<p>"Listen, hot-shot!" growled Astro. "I want to know
where you got these spools and how."</p>

<p>"Well, if that isn't gratitude for you!" muttered
Roger. "I go out and risk my neck for my dear beloved
unit mates and they stand around arguing instead of
buckling down to study."</p>

<p>"This is no joke, Roger," said Tom seriously. "Now for
the last time, will you tell us how you got them?"</p>

<p>Roger thought a moment and then shrugged his
shoulders. "All right," he said finally. "When I went
down to the library to see if it was our turn for them
yet, I found that we were still twenty-seventh in line."</p>

<p>"Twenty-seventh?" gasped Astro.</p>

<p>"That's right, spaceboy!" snorted Roger. "So I tried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
con that little space doll of a librarian into moving our
names up on the list, but just then an Earthworm cadet
came in with an order from Tony Richards of the <i>Capella</i>
unit, an order for the very spools we needed."</p>

<p>"You mean, you took them from an Earthworm?"
queried Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't take them exactly," replied Roger. "I
waited for him out on the quadrangle and I told him he
was wanted in the cadet dispatcher's office right away
and that I would take the spools on up to Tony."</p>

<p>"And you brought them here!" howled Astro.</p>

<p>"Yup." Roger grinned. "Do you think that squirt will
know who I am? Not in a million years. And by the
time Tony and the others do find out who has them,
we'll be finished. Get it?"</p>

<p>"I get it, all right, you crummy little chiseler,"
growled Astro. "Tom, we gotta give these back to Tony."</p>

<p>Tom nodded. "You're right," he said.</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute!" said Roger angrily. "I went to
a lot of trouble to get these things for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look, Roger," Tom interrupted, "I would rather
have one night with those spools than a two-week leave
in Atom City right now. But the <i>Capella</i> unit is having
a tough time making the Spring passing lists. They need
those spools more than we do."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Astro. "We could probably take the tests
now and pass, but they really have to study. I'm for getting
them back to the <i>Capella</i> unit right now. How
about you, Tom?"</p>

<p>The young cadet nodded and turned to Roger who
stood there, frowning. "Roger," said Tom, "both Astro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and I really appreciate it. But you wouldn't want the
<i>Capella</i> unit to flunk out of the Academy, would you?"</p>

<p>Roger gnawed at his thumbnail and then looked at
his two unit mates sheepishly. "You're right, fellas," he
said. "It was kind of a dirty trick. Give me the spools.
I'll take them back to Tony right now."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" exclaimed Astro. "It's after hours.
We're not supposed to be out of the dorm."</p>

<p>For a second the three boys looked at each other hesitantly.
Then, as though they had telepathically conveyed
their individual decisions to each other, they
turned toward the door. Tom opened it and stepped out
into the hall cautiously, then turned back and nodded.
Roger and Astro followed him quickly.</p>

<p>As Roger closed the door behind him, he murmured,
"There's no reason for all of us to go. I was the one who
took the spools, so I should bring them back. Why
should you two guys risk getting caught?"</p>

<p>Astro punched him in the shoulder fondly. "We always
work together, don't we?" he declared. "If one's
gonna get into trouble, we all should."</p>

<p>"Let's go," urged Tom in a sharp whisper, and they
all raced silently toward the slidestairs.</p>

<p>Seconds later, the three cadets of the <i>Polaris</i> unit
were down in the main hallway of the dormitory building,
tiptoeing toward the front portal. Pausing only to
look into the O.D.'s office to make sure the officer
wouldn't spot them, they reached the portal and ducked
out. Pausing again to scan the immediate area for any
watch officers, they darted across the slidewalk and into
the shadows of the shrubbery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Quickly and soundlessly, they raced across the green
lawn of the quadrangle toward the dormitory where
the <i>Capella</i> unit was quartered. Once they sprawled
headlong on the turf and lay still as a watch officer suddenly
appeared out of the darkness at the base of the
Tower of Galileo. But he walked past without seeing
them and they continued on across the quadrangle.</p>

<p>Reaching another clump of shrubbery right opposite
the <i>Capella</i> unit's dormitory, the boys stopped and discussed
their final move.</p>

<p>"This is getting ridiculous," whispered Roger. "I
shouldn't have let you two come with me. But I'm going
the rest of the way myself."</p>

<p>"We came this far, Roger," asserted Tom. "We'll go
the rest of the way and help you explain."</p>

<p>"And you've got a space-blasting lot to explain."</p>

<p>The three cadets whirled as a familiar voice snarled
out of the darkness behind them. They saw three figures,
all in cadet uniforms, wearing the insigne of the
<i>Capella</i> unit. In the forefront was Tony Richards scowling
angrily.</p>

<p>"Tony!" gasped Tom. "What are you doing out here?"</p>

<p>"We were on our way over to your dorm, Corbett,"
growled Tony Richards. "We saw you three sneaking
across the quadrangle."</p>

<p>"Coming to pay us a visit, fellas?" asked Roger
blandly.</p>

<p>"You know blasted well why we were coming,"
snapped McAvoy, the second member of the <i>Capella</i>
crew.</p>

<p>Davison, the third member of the unit, stepped forward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
"Give us back our study spools," he demanded.</p>

<p>"Take it easy," said Tom in a calm voice. "We were
bringing them back to you."</p>

<p>"I'll bet," snapped McAvoy.</p>

<p>"Relax," growled Astro. "Tom said we were returning
them. We admit it was a dirty trick, but you haven't
lost much time. Half an hour maybe."</p>

<p>"Don't try to cover for Manning, Astro," said Tony
heatedly. "It's a shame you two guys are stuck with a
bad rocket like Manning in your unit."</p>

<p>"Bad rocket!" exclaimed Roger.</p>

<p>"Now, wait a minute, Tony," Tom said, advancing toward
the broad-shouldered cadet. "We are returning
the spools, and we apologize for yanking them from the
Earthworm. But that doesn't mean we'll listen to that
kind of talk about Roger."</p>

<p>"He stole them, didn't he?" retorted Davison.</p>

<p>Roger stepped forward. "Davy, my boy," he said in a
low controlled tone, "I don't like that remark. I've got a
notion to make you eat that word."</p>

<p>"I don't think you can, Manning," replied the angry
cadet.</p>

<p>Tom stepped between them quickly. "Listen, fellows,
we don't want any trouble. Here are the spools." He
held them out.</p>

<p>"That's what I mean, Corbett," said McAvoy sarcastically.
"Manning gets you in trouble and then you and
the big boy have to bail him out."</p>

<p>"We've apologized," retorted Astro angrily. "You're
getting the spools back. So no more cracks about
Roger."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can take care of myself, Astro," said Roger.</p>

<p>"Here, take the spools and get back to your dorm,"
growled Tom. He handed the pile of spools over, but as
Tony extended his hands, one of the spools dropped to
the grass. No one made a move to pick it up.</p>

<p>"There are the spools," said Tom icily. "Now beat it."</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Davison, leaning over to pick up the
spool. "The air is beginning to stink around here."</p>

<p>Red-faced, Roger stepped forward and put his foot
on the spool just as Davison reached for it. "That's
enough, Davison," he snarled.</p>

<p>"Why, you dirty space crawler&mdash;" Davison straightened
up and swung wildly. Roger ducked the blow easily,
then spun the heavy-set cadet around and pushed
him back into the bushes.</p>

<p>Tony Richards stepped forward and Astro turned to
him threateningly, but Tom quickly shoved them aside
and faced Richards.</p>

<p>"Listen, Tony," he said. "We're all out after hours,
and if a watch officer spots us, we've had it. We don't
want any trouble." He glanced at Davison, who was
being restrained by McAvoy. "We apologize. Now get
out of here before we're all logged."</p>

<p>Richards nodded and started to turn to his unit mates
when suddenly Davison jerked free and lunged at
Roger. The blond-haired cadet was not caught
unawares. He stepped aside and threw a quick jolting
right straight to the <i>Capella</i> cadet's jaw. Davison
staggered back and fell to the ground. He shook his head,
jumped to his feet again, and charged back with a roar.</p>

<p>Both Tom and Astro and Tony Richards and McAvoy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
grabbed at their respective unit mates and tried to restrain
them. In the struggle to keep Roger and Davison
apart, Astro accidentally pushed Richards to one
side.</p>

<p>"What in blazes&mdash;!" yelled Richards. He suddenly released
Davison and gave Astro a shove that sent the
big cadet sprawling. And then, without warning, McAvoy
swung at Tom. The curly-haired cadet saw the
blow coming a fraction of a second too late and caught
it on the side of his head. He fell back into the bushes.</p>

<p>Roger yelled in anger at the sudden attack, and grabbing
Davison by the front of his tunic, slammed a hard
right into the cadet's stomach. Richards grabbed Roger,
holding him around the head and neck, as McAvoy
swung at him viciously. Seeing their unit mate pommeled,
Tom and Astro charged back and the battle was
on. The two units forgot about the watch officers and
the strong possibility of being caught and slugged it out
in the darkness of the quadrangle. The fight seemed to
be the climax of a long-standing feud. The <i>Polaris</i> crew
had first come to grips with Richards and his unit mates
when they were assigned to the old rocket cruiser <i>Arcturus</i>.
When the ship was scrapped, the cadets were
transferred to the <i>Capella</i>, but the rivalry continued
stronger than before. Time and time again, the two
crack units had competed for hours on the athletic
fields, in space flight tests, and in the classroom. The
<i>Polaris</i> unit had constantly come out ahead, often by no
more than a fraction of points, but their superiority was
clear, and the <i>Capella</i> unit could not repress its resentment
and jealousy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Tony Richards and Tom had squared off and were
boxing with lightninglike thrusts of their fists, each
waiting for an opening. In back of them, Roger and
Davison were simply hammering away at each other's
mid-sections, and Astro and McAvoy were rolling
around on the ground like bears, growling and tugging.
It was brute strength against brute strength.</p>

<p>Tom danced away from Richards' rapierlike left,
weaved low, and shot a hard right to his opponent's
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'stomach. That'">stomach that</ins> left him gasping. Richards doubled over
and stepped in to bring up a solid right, then hesitated.
Richards was through. The blow to the mid-section had
taken all the fight out of him. Tom refused to pursue his
advantage while the other could not fight back. His anger
cooling rapidly, Tom realized that the whole fight
was nothing more than a misunderstanding. As Richards
sank to the grass helpless and gasping for breath,
Tom turned to break up the other two fights. But Roger
was just finishing his battle with Davison. Feinting to
the mid-section and pulling Davison's guard down,
Roger hooked his left cleanly to the jaw, following immediately
with a haymaker right. Davison dropped to
the turf, out cold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Astro had rolled on top of the last cadet
of the <i>Capella</i> unit, and with his great strength,
clamped McAvoy's arms to his side. Face to face, the
two cadets glared at each other. The muscles tightened
in Astro's arms, and beads of sweat popped out on his
face.</p>

<p>"Give up!" demanded the Venusian, tightening his
grip.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Tom shot a hard right to his opponent&#39;s stomach</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Slowly McAvoy sagged under the pressure Astro was
applying and his face began to redden.</p>

<p>"He'll break his back," whispered Roger to Tom.</p>

<p>Tom nodded and stepped forward. "Let him go, Astro.
He's finished."</p>

<p>Astro did not let go. His face was white with anger.
McAvoy bent further back. "Give up," demanded Astro.</p>

<p>"Grab him," said Tom to Roger. "Get him off Mac before
he breaks his back."</p>

<p>Tom and Roger jumped to Astro's side and each
grabbed one of the powerful arms encircling McAvoy.
It took all their strength to break the viselike hold the
giant Venusian had on the other cadet, but slowly they
pulled the muscular arms back and McAvoy slumped
to the grass.</p>

<p>The three victorious cadets paused and looked down
at the beaten <i>Capella</i> crew, then looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Roger, "I suppose that the least we
can do now is get them back to their dorm."</p>

<p>Tom and Astro nodded. As the three boys started forward
they were stopped by a voice behind them&mdash;a
voice that roared like an atomic blast.</p>

<p>"<i>Stand to!</i>"</p>

<p>Whirling around in surprise for the second time
within a space of ten minutes, Tom, Astro, and Roger
saw a menacing sight standing behind them, his balled
fists jammed on his hips, his booted legs widespread,
and his massive head thrust forward. It was Major Lou
Connel, more familiarly known as "Blast-off" Connel, a
Senior Line Officer of the Solar Guard and the sternest
disciplinarian in the whole Academy. Behind him stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
a short, thin man, whom none of the boys recognized.</p>

<p>Connel stepped forward slowly and menacingly,
glaring at the three boys.</p>

<p>"Out a little late, aren't you, boys?" he asked with a
mildness that sent a chill down their spines.</p>

<p>"Y-yes sir," replied Tom, a slight tremor in his voice.</p>

<p>"On official business, I presume?" The major's voice
was still as smooth as silk.</p>

<p>Tom gulped and then shook his head. "N-no, sir," he
quavered.</p>

<p>Connel's eyes widened in mock horror. "Why, Corbett,"
he exclaimed, "didn't anyone ever tell you the
rules of Space Academy? Or perhaps you didn't know
what time it was?"</p>

<p>Tom bit his lip. He knew that he and his unit mates
were caught in a hopeless trap and that Connel was
simply baiting them. "I knew what time it was, sir," he
said. "We're out after hours."</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a movement in the brush behind
Tom as McAvoy stumbled to his feet. Richards also sat
up groggily.</p>

<p>"Major!" It was the man behind Connel who spoke.
"Who are they?"</p>

<p>As though in answer, Davison stood up too and the
three members of the <i>Capella</i> unit were suddenly and
horribly aware of the presence of Connel. They immediately
braced themselves, their faces white with sudden
fear.</p>

<p>"So!" Now the major's voice began to roar again.
"Fighting, eh? Well, now we really have something
here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir," began Richards tremulously, "if you'll let us
explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll let you explain all right," thundered Connel.
"Out after hours, fighting, you'll have a great time explaining
to an inquiry."</p>

<p>"An inquiry!" Tom exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Did you expect anything less?" roared Connel. "You
are all under arrest and confined to quarters."</p>

<p>The six cadets all trembled but said nothing, standing
at rigid attention, eyes straight ahead.</p>

<p>"Return to your quarters immediately."</p>

<p>As one, the cadets wheeled and marched off. Tom,
Astro, and Roger walked across the quadrangle back to
their dorm, and the <i>Capella</i> unit took the slidewalk that
led to their quarters. Connel watched them go, a ferocious
scowl on his craggy features.</p>

<p>"Little rough on them, weren't you, Major?" asked
the man who stood beside the Solar Guard officer.</p>

<p>"Rules are meant to be obeyed, Professor Hemmingwell,"
retorted Connel stiffly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," mused the stranger. "But
what's this about an inquiry?"</p>

<p>"A trial, Professor. A trial conducted by the cadets
themselves to see whether or not the accused should be
kicked out of the Academy."</p>

<p>"Kicked out?" exclaimed the professor. "You certainly
do believe in discipline."</p>

<p>"These boys are to be Solar Guardsmen," replied
Connel shortly. "If they can't obey orders now, they
never will."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all very unimportant really, Major," Hemmingwell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
said with a shrug. "We have many more vital
things to think about now than mere cadets. Shall we
go? Commander Walters is waiting for us."</p>

<p>As the little man in civilian clothes walked away,
Connel stifled a blistering retort. True, his mission here
at the Academy was of great importance. But cadets
were important too. And he was afraid. The <i>Polaris</i> unit
was in grave trouble, grave enough to cause expulsion
from the Academy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2" id="CHAPTER_2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p>Space Academy, U.S.A.!</p>

<p>This was the dream and goal of every boy in the
thrilling year 2354, when mankind had reached out beyond
the bounds of Earth and had conquered space,
colonizing planets and blazing trails to distant worlds
deep in the black void of the outer universe. To support
the ever-growing need for trained spacemen to man the
rocket ships that linked the planets and distant satellite
outposts, the Solar Alliance, the government of the
solar system, had erected Space Academy. It was there
that the most promising boys were trained to become
members of the Solar Guard to patrol the space lanes
and keep peace in the universe.</p>

<p>Organized into tight, hard-hitting units of three, the
Academy cadets were trained to work together under
the most severe conditions. Their waking hours were
spent in one of two places; in powerful rocket cruisers,
blasting through space on endless training missions, or
at the Academy in classrooms and lecture halls, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
they studied everything from the theory of space flight
to the application of space laws. A very important
course of study was the theory of government. For,
above all else, the Solar Alliance was a government of
the people. And to assure the survival and continuance
of that democratic system, the officers of the Solar
Guard functioned as the watchdogs of the space democracy,
entrusted with the vital mission of making
sure the government reflected the will of the people.</p>

<p>As a practical approach to this course, the Academy
officials had established a Cadet Council for the settlement
of disputes and infractions of rules by the cadets.
It was to this cadet governing body that the fight between
the <i>Polaris</i> and the <i>Capella</i> units was referred by
Major Connel.</p>

<p>The Academy had buzzed with talk since the fight,
and sides were drawn hard and fast. Both units were
extremely popular and the arguments raged through
the dormitories as to which unit was at fault.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Cadet Council decided to have a full
trial to give each unit a fair chance to defend itself
against the charges. A judge and jury were selected and
lawyers appointed for each side. Finally a date was set
for the trial.</p>

<p>During this time, Tom, Roger, and Astro were confined
to their quarters. They did not talk much, each
conscious of the fact that should the Cadet Council decide
against them, they might be expelled from the
Academy. The same was true about the <i>Capella</i> unit,
of course, but the Council might decide the <i>Polaris</i> had
instigated the whole affair. Roger was particularly silent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
since his actions in obtaining the study spools had
started the whole chain of disastrous events.</p>

<p>The boys did not know which cadet would be appointed
to defend them until late the following afternoon
when there was a knock on the door, and a small,
thin cadet, wearing a thick pair of eyeglasses that gave
him a decided owllike look, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Alfie Higgins!" cried Tom.</p>

<p>"The Brain!" yelled Astro.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, pal!" shouted Roger.</p>

<p>The three cadets surrounded little Alfie and pommeled
him playfully in their joy at seeing another cadet.
Alfie merely looked at them gravely.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tom, Roger, Astro," he said somberly.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" asked Tom. "We're not
allowed visitors."</p>

<p>"I'm not a visitor, Tom," replied the little cadet. "I'm
your defense lawyer." He glanced at Roger and Astro.
"I hope that will be satisfactory to you."</p>

<p>"Satisfactory!" exclaimed Tom. "Alfie, we couldn't ask
for anyone better."</p>

<p>"That's right, Brain," said Roger. "You're the boy
for us."</p>

<p>Astro grunted his approval. "Yeah."</p>

<p>"Well, in that case," said Alfie, opening his brief case,
"I would suggest that we get right down to the facts.
The trial is tomorrow."</p>

<p>"All right, Alfie, we're ready," said Tom. "I suppose
you want to hear the whole thing."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," said Alfie, adjusting his eyeglasses.
"You start, Roger."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Sitting around the room, relaxed, yet concerned, the
four cadets discussed the details of the case. Alfie took
copious notes, occasionally interrupting Tom or Roger
or Astro to ask a pointed question.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-031.png" width="500" height="416" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>They talked for nearly four hours before Alfie was finally
satisfied that he knew all the facts. He left them
with the same somber attitude he had when he first arrived,
and when the boys were alone, they each felt a
chill of fear. The full meaning of a defense lawyer hit
them. They were in serious trouble. After a few moments
of silence, Tom rose and went into the bathroom
to take a shower. Astro flopped on his back in his bunk
and went to sleep. Roger began throwing darts idly at
his "solar system" over his bunk. It was a map of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
own design depicting the planets revolving around the
sun, only each planet was represented by a picture of a
girl, and his own grinning countenance was the sun. He
was known to have made dates by throwing a dart at
the map blindly and taking out the girl whose picture
he had hit.</p>

<p>When Tom returned a few minutes later, he looked
at his unit mates and shook his head. Never, in all the
adventures they had shared or all the tough situations
they had been in, had either Roger or Astro given up as
they seemed to be doing now.</p>

<p>"And," thought Tom miserably, "with good reason
too! I feel like tossing in the sponge myself."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The huge Space Academy gymnasium had been converted
into a temporary courtroom, and at ten <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> the
following day the cavernous chamber was packed with
all the cadets who could get off duty, in addition to a
liberal sprinkling of Solar Guard officers and instructors
who were keenly interested in their pupils' handling of
orderly democratic procedure.</p>

<p>As the cadet judge opened the proceedings, Commander
Walters, Major Connel, Captain Strong, and
Lieutenant Wolchek, unit commander of the <i>Capella</i>
crew, watched intently from their seats in the back of
the gym. Up forward, at two small tables immediately
in front of the Council's platform, the <i>Polaris</i> and
<i>Capella</i> units sat rigidly, while their defense lawyers
arranged papers and data on the table for quick reference.
Little Alfie Higgins didn't say a word to Tom,
Roger, or Astro, merely studied his opponent, Cadet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Benjy Edwards, who was acting as attorney for the <i>Capella</i>
unit. Edwards, a beefy boy with a florid face,
looked across the chamber and sneered at Tom. The
young cadet repressed a quick shudder of anger. There
was bad blood between the two. Once, Tom had found
Edwards bullying a helpless group of Earthworm cadets,
forcing them to march and exercise under a broiling
Martian sun for no reason at all, and Tom had put
a stop to it. Edwards had taken every opportunity to
get back at Tom, and now he had his best chance.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the trial was argued bitterly.
Though the issues were clear-cut&mdash;illegal possession of
the study spools, out on the quadrangle after hours, and
fighting&mdash;Edwards tried to accuse the <i>Polaris</i> unit of irrelevant
infractions. But Alfie Higgins was his equal.
From the beginning, he admitted that the <i>Polaris</i> unit
was guilty of the first charge, but made a strong claim
that they had more than made up for the infraction by
risking censure to return the spools to their rightful
owners. In addition, he forced Tony Richards to admit
that he had accepted Roger's apology. The Council
agreed to drop that charge and to hold the second
charge in abeyance, since both units seemed to have had
good reason for being out after hours. Benjy Edwards
scowled but could find no reason to object to the Council's
decision. Alfie, on the other hand, broke into a
smile for the first time that morning. He turned to the
Council and announced that the only point of issue was
the fight and who struck the first blow.</p>

<p>In the back of the room, Connel turned to Strong. "I,
personally, am going to sign the pass for a week's leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
for Alfie when this is over," he said. "I never saw such a
ding-blasted brain in operation in all my life."</p>

<p>"He really slipped one over on Benjy Edwards all
right," muttered Strong, his voice tinged with pride.</p>

<p>In front of the Council platform, Alfie turned to the
judge.</p>

<p>"I would like to call to the stand, if the court please,"
he said in a clear voice, "Cadet Tom Corbett."</p>

<p>Tom walked to the chair, was sworn in, and sat down,
facing Alfie.</p>

<p>"Cadet Corbett," Higgins paused, and then asked almost
casually, "did you strike the first blow?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Dismissed," said Higgins suddenly. "Call Roger
Manning to the stand, please."</p>

<p>Roger rose, and passing Tom on the way back, took
his place on the stand and repeated the oath.</p>

<p>Alfie looked at Roger calmly and in a clear voice
asked, "Cadet Manning, did you strike the first blow?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Dismissed," said Alfie. "Please call Cadet Astro to
the stand."</p>

<p>The cadet audience began to murmur and sit forward
tensely.</p>

<p>"What the devil is he doing?" growled Connel.</p>

<p>Strong grinned. "Blast me if I know, Lou," he said.
"But wait and see. I'll bet you ten credits it's a lulu."</p>

<p>Astro was sworn in and Alfie waited for the room to
become quiet.</p>

<p>"Cadet Astro," he said finally, "you have heard the
other members of the <i>Polaris</i> unit state, under solemn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
oath, that they did not strike the first blow. Now, I ask
you to consider carefully your answer. Did you, Cadet
Astro"&mdash;Alfie paused dramatically, and nearly shouted
the final part of the question&mdash;"strike the first blow?"</p>

<p>"No!" bellowed Astro.</p>

<p>"Dismissed," said Alfie quickly, turning to the Council.
"Gentlemen," he said, "he did not strike the first
blow, nor did Cadet Corbett, nor Cadet Manning. And
I will not insist that the three members of the <i>Capella</i>
unit be asked the same question, since I concede that
they are three impeccable gentlemen who could <i>not</i>
strike the first blow in a common fight."</p>

<p>As the audience in the courtroom burst into a roar,
Benjy Edwards jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Your honor," he appealed, "I insist that the <i>Capella</i>
unit be allowed to take the stand and deny the
charge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your honor," interrupted Alfie, "the <i>Polaris</i> unit
makes no charge. They freely admit that the <i>Capella</i>
unit could not, I repeat, sir, could not have struck the
first blow. And the <i>Polaris</i> unit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your honor&mdash;!" cried Edwards. "I insist."</p>

<p>The cadet judge rapped his gavel. "<i>Polaris</i> counsel
will speak."</p>

<p>"Thank you, your honor. I just wanted to say that the
members of the <i>Polaris</i> unit defer to the <i>Capella</i> unit.
I submit, your honor, that it was nothing more than a
misunderstanding and that both sides should be punished
or freed."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked the cadet judge.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Alfie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Counsel for the <i>Capella</i> unit may speak now. Do you
insist on having your defendants brought to the stand
to swear they did not start the fight?"</p>

<p>"Your honor&mdash;" began Benjy. But Alfie had already
planted the seed. There were shouts of "Give it to both
of them" from the gym.</p>

<p>Red-faced, Edwards held up his hand and appealed
for quiet. "Your honor," he began at last, "after consultation
with the members of the <i>Capella</i> unit, they have
directed me to state that they are willing to abide by
the suggestion of the <i>Polaris</i> counsel."</p>

<p>As the cadets in the courtroom roared their approval,
the cadet judge consulted quickly with the members of
the Council. A decision was reached quickly. A verdict
of conduct unbecoming cadets was brought against
both units, with orders for a strong reprimand to be
placed on their individual official records. In addition,
each unit was denied leaves and week-end passes from
the Academy until the end of the term, four weeks
away. All spare time was to be spent on guard duty.</p>

<p>"You are to report to Chief Warrant Officer Timothy
Rush for further orders on all time not actually accountable
for in Academy schedules," concluded the cadet
judge. "Dismissed."</p>

<p>The case was closed with a loud roar of approval
from the entire cadet audience, who had seen justice
done and democracy in action. Tom, Astro, and Roger
looked at each other and smiled. They were still Space
Cadets.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3" id="CHAPTER_3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>


<p>"Where is Captain Strong?"</p>

<p>Startled, Commander Walters glanced up to see Major
Connel enter his office, accompanied by Professor
Hemmingwell. The thin little man scowled with irritation
as he walked right up to the commander's desk.</p>

<p>"I wanted Captain Strong here for this meeting," the
professor continued.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Walters. "Captain Strong <i>should</i>
be here." He turned to Connel. "Have you seen him,
Connel?"</p>

<p>As Connel lowered his bulk into a soft chair, he
sighed. "Steve is with his unit, chewing them out over
that fight with the <i>Capella</i> unit."</p>

<p>Walters grinned. "You heard about our trial, Professor?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hemmingwell stiffly. "Frankly, I cannot
see how Captain Strong can ignore this meeting to
hold hands with those infantile cadets."</p>

<p>Connel's face turned red and he glanced quickly at
Walters, whose face was approaching the same color.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Neither expected such a comment from a scientist.</p>

<p>"Professor," said Connel heavily, leaning forward in
his chair, "I assure you Steve Strong is <i>not</i> holding their
hands. In fact, I would hate to be in those cadets' shoes
right now."</p>

<p>Hemmingwell grunted and drew back from Connel's
burning glare. "Be that as it may," he said. "I cannot see
that the staff of this institution has done anything constructive
for the last three days. So far as I'm concerned,
this childish talk about a common fight has
been a complete waste of time."</p>

<p>"Professor Hemmingwell," said Commander Walters,
rising from his chair, "if there had to be a choice between
your project, as valuable as it may be, and the
valuable lesson learned today by my cadets, I'll tell you
right now that the lesson would come first. This was a
very important issue. The cadets had their real taste of
democracy in action today, down on a level where they
could understand it. And, I dare say, there are quite a
few boys who heard that childish talk, as you put it,
and will remember it some time in the future when
they are called on to act as officers of the Solar Alliance."</p>

<p>Connel cleared his throat noisily. "I think we'd better
get on with the meeting," he said. "Do you have the
plans and specifications, Hemmingwell?"</p>

<p>But the wiry professor refused to be dissuaded. He
faced Commander Walters and wagged his finger under
the spaceman's nose.</p>

<p>"You have a perfect right to your own ideas concerning
the education of your cadets!" he shouted. "But I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
have a right to my ideas regarding my space projectile
operations. I've devoted a good part of my life to this
plan, and I will not allow anything, or anyone, to stand
in my way."</p>

<p>Before Walters could reply, Connel jumped up and
growled.</p>

<p>"All right! Now that we've got the speeches out of the
way, let's get down to work."</p>

<p>Walters and the professor suddenly stopped short
and grinned at the brusque line officer, who, for all his
bullying tactics, knew how to take the edge off a touchy
situation. Walters sat down again and Hemmingwell
spread out several large maps on Walters' desk. He
pointed to a location on the chart of the area surrounding
Space Academy.</p>

<p>"This is the area here," he said, placing his finger on
the map. "I think it is best suited for our purpose. Dave
Barret and Carter Devers concur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Someone mention my name?"</p>

<p>The sliding door to the commander's office opened
and a tall, distinguished man with iron-gray hair entered,
followed by a handsome, younger man.</p>

<p>"Devers!" exclaimed Hemmingwell in obvious delight.
"I didn't expect you until this evening."</p>

<p>"Got away earlier than I figured," replied the elder
man, who then turned to the two Solar Guard officers.
"Hello, Commander Walters, Major Connel. Meet Dave
Barret, my assistant." He gestured toward the young
man beside him and they shook hands in turn.</p>

<p>"Well," said Devers, "have we missed anything?"</p>

<p>"Just starting," replied Walters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fine," said Devers. "Oh, by the way, I want it understood,
Commander, that while I am lending Dave to
you to work on the operation with the professor, I'm not
even going to let you pay him. He remains on my payroll,
so you can't take him away from me. The Jilolo
Spaceways would be lost without him."</p>

<p>Walters smiled. "All right with me," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't care <i>who</i> pays him, as long as he's with me
on this, Commander," said Hemmingwell, wiping his
glasses carefully. "That young man has a mind equipped
with a built-in calculator."</p>

<p>Dave Barret grinned in obvious embarrassment. "If
Mr. Devers can devote his time to you for one credit a
year as salary, I have no objections to working on this
project," he said. "In fact, I told Mr. Devers that if he
didn't let me come down here, I'd quit and come, anyway."</p>

<p>Hemmingwell beamed. "Well, now, if Captain Strong
were only here, we could get along with the business at
hand."</p>

<p>Devers frowned. "Why is he so important?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Steve has been placed in charge of procurement for
the construction of the hangar and getting the spur line
in from the monorail station," replied Connel. "And
that reminds me, Professor," he continued. "Where is
your hangar going to be? And where is that spur coming
in from? Are we going to have a lot of building to
do to get that blasted thing snaked over those hills?"
Connel pointed to the protective ring of high rugged
peaks that surrounded the Academy.</p>

<p>"That's why Dave Barret here is so important," replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Hemmingwell. "He figured out a way of tunneling
through this section here"&mdash;he pointed to a particularly
rugged section of the hills&mdash;"at half the cost of bringing
it straight in on that plain there."</p>

<p>Connel and Walters studied the map closely. "Very
good," said Walters.</p>

<p>"You think you can do it, Dave?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can, sir," replied the young man.</p>

<p>"And save time?" growled Connel.</p>

<p>"I'll have that line through, and in operation, bringing
in the first haul of hangar material in three weeks."</p>

<p>Impressed by the young man's confidence, Connel
turned to Commander Walters and nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, if you can do that, Barret," said Walters, "Professor
Hemmingwell will have to begin his operations
now, won't you, Professor?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said the wiry old man. "Right now,
this very minute."</p>

<p>Devers suddenly spoke up. "I would like to have one
thing explained, Commander, unless, of course, it's a
breach of security, but&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"I've been going along with you for some time now,"
explained Devers. "But I still don't know the exact
nature of the projectile you propose to build. What's the
purpose of it?"</p>

<p>"You certainly deserve an answer to that question,"
said Commander Walters warmly. "You've contributed
your services to this operation absolutely blindly. Now
you should know everything." He paused and looked at
Hemmingwell and Connel, who nodded in return. "Carter,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
he resumed, "we are going to create a spaceship
that can launch a large projectile filled with cargo and
send it to any small area."</p>

<p>Carter Devers' face lighted up. "You mean, you are
going to fire payloads from space freighters instead of
landing with them?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Walters. "These freighters will deliver
mail and supplies to out-of-the-way settlements that do
not have a spaceport large enough to handle the giant
freighters and have to depend on surface transport from
the larger cities."</p>

<p>Carter Devers shook his head slowly. "This is the
most amazing thing I've ever heard of in my life."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be surprised, Carter," said Walters,
his face glowing with pleasure. "The big item, of
course, is to lick the problem of standardizing the
receivers for the projectiles. They must be lightweight,
easily assembled, and precision made, since it's going
to have an electronic gismo inside for the projectile to
'home' on."</p>

<p>Professor Hemmingwell grunted. "That electronic
gismo, as you call it, is the real idea behind the whole
operation."</p>

<p>"How is that, Professor?" asked Devers.</p>

<p>"Well, it works on this principle," began Hemmingwell.
"The receiver will send out a distinctive radar
beam. In the spaceship, the projectile designated for
that receiver will be tuned in to the frequency of that
beam and fired from the ship. A homing device, built
into the projectile will take over, guiding it right down
the beam to its destination."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how does that radar beam work?" asked Devers.</p>

<p>"That," said Connel stiffly, "is a military secret."</p>

<p>"Of course," nodded Devers, smiling. "I was just curious."</p>

<p>"Well, now that we're agreed on a site for the operation,"
said Professor Hemmingwell, "is there anything
else you want to discuss, Commander?"</p>

<p>"Not for the moment, Professor," replied the commandant
of Space Academy. "You have any more
questions, Major Connel?"</p>

<p>When Connel shook his head, Devers spoke up again.</p>

<p>"There is something else I would like to know, if it
isn't a breach of military secrecy," he said with a smile
at Connel. "I don't remember seeing anything about
this project in the bills sent before the Solar Council.
When was it authorized?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't," snapped Hemmingwell. "It was blocked
before it came to a vote. So I ran around the whole Solar
Alliance, begging and borrowing the money to finance
the project myself."</p>

<p>"And the Solar Guard is just lending technical assistance
and facilities," supplied Walters. "Of course,
should the project succeed, we will go before the Solar
Council with an emergency request to incorporate the
idea into the defense of all Solar Guard outposts."</p>

<p>"Private capital, eh?" said Devers, turning to look at
the professor admiringly. "You are a very brave man,
Professor Hemmingwell, to risk so much. And, I might
add, you must be an excellent salesman to sell Solar Alliance
bankers your ideas."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Common sense," snorted the professor. "Plain horse
sense."</p>

<p>"Still," insisted Devers, "most of the bankers with
whom I've ever tried to talk common sense <i>were</i>
horses." As everyone laughed, he turned to Walters.
"Now, just what do you want me to do, Commander?"</p>

<p>"Carter, you've done so much for this project already
that I'm going to give you a rest," said Walters.</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"From now on," Major Connel broke in, "the project
will be in the hands of the professor. If he needs
anything, he'll tell Steve Strong. If Strong can't fulfill the
request, he'll pass it on to Commander Walters, and if
the commander feels it necessary to have your help, he
will contact you."</p>

<p>"You understand, of course," said Walters, trying to
soften the major's flat statement.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Devers easily. "Still, if you need
my help on this thing at all, don't fail to call me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Carter," said Walters. "You've been a
great help already."</p>

<p>Shaking hands all around and wishing them well,
Devers left the office. Dave Barret, Commander Walters,
and Professor Hemmingwell turned to their study
of the map, but Major Connel remained where he was,
rubbing his chin thoughtfully. He shook his head as if
to brush an impossible idea out of his mind and then
turned to the map.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Tom Corbett, Roger Manning, and Astro stood at
rigid attention in their dormitory room, backs ramrod<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
straight, eyes front, hands stiffly at their sides. Captain
Steve Strong, his face red and voice hoarse, strode up
and down in front of them.</p>

<p>"And another thing!" he roared. "This court reprimand
goes on your official records, and you're going to
spend your time on guard duty like any common Earthworm
that doesn't know its rocket from its pocket!" For
nearly half an hour the cadets had listened to their unit
instructor bawl them out. "When I think," he continued,
"when I <i>think</i> of how close you three space brats
came to getting kicked out of the Academy&mdash;" Words
seemed to fail the young captain momentarily and he
slumped on one of the bunks and looked at the row of
cadets, shaking his head. "Why, in the name of Saturn,
I ever accepted the responsibility of making you three
bird brains into cadets is beyond me. And to think that
when you first came here, I thought you had that special
something to make you an outstanding unit. I even
went out on a limb for you. And now you pull a stunt
like this."</p>

<p>Behind them, the door opened and a short man, no
more than five feet tall, but with the bulging muscles of
a tiny giant stretching his bright-red enlisted man's uniform,
stepped inside. He saluted Strong smartly.</p>

<p>"Chief Petty Officer Rush here to assign the <i>Polaris</i>
unit to guard duty, sir," he announced.</p>

<p>"All right, Firehouse," said Strong, using the man's
nickname. "Give it to them. Show them no mercy. By
the rings of Saturn, they've got to be made to realize
their responsibilities!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the thick little man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Strong walked out of the room without another word,
nor even a backward glance at the cadets.</p>

<p>As soon as the door closed, Timothy "Firehouse"
Rush faced the three cadets, his beaten and battered
face glowing with anticipation.</p>

<p>"Get this!" he growled. "When you're assigned to
guard duty with the E.M.'s of the Solar Guard, you
leave your immunity as cadets here in the Academy.
From now on, you belong to me. And I'll tell you right
now, there isn't anything in space that I hate more, or
think less of, than Space Cadets. You get special privileges
you don't deserve because you wear that uniform.
You get a chance to learn to be a spaceman and most of
you muff it. I've got E.M.'s in my outfit that could blast
circles around either of you&mdash;guys that deserve the
chance you've got, and fouled out because they can't
spell or don't know how to hold a cup of tea with their
fingers the right way. When you come to me, it means
you've done something bad. You're on your way out.
And I'm going to try my best to see that you make it&mdash;<i>out</i>."
He took a step forward and glared at them. "Report
to me at 1800 hours and"&mdash;his voice dropped to a
gravelly roar&mdash;"you better not be late&mdash;and you better
not be early."</p>

<p>He spun on his heels in a perfect about-face and left
the room.</p>

<p>"There is only one consolation," sighed Tom. "The
<i>Capella</i> unit is getting the same thing we're getting."</p>

<p>"Here we go!" breathed Roger slowly.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about quitting the Academy, anyway,"
growled Astro.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4" id="CHAPTER_4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>


<p>"Halt!"</p>

<p>Roger growled the order into the darkness and
unslung the paralo-ray rifle from his shoulder, bringing it
around to firing position. "Advance and be recognized,"
he said flatly.</p>

<p>Nothing moved. Even the air seemed still.</p>

<p>"Advance and be recognized," Roger ordered again.
Still nothing moved. The cadet glanced around quickly
in the direction of the guardhouse where he knew there
was a communicator to the sergeant of the guard.
Should he call for help? He decided against it and
moved forward toward the noise he had heard, his
finger poised on the trigger of the paralo-ray gun.</p>

<p>"Advance and be recognized," he called again. As he
walked slowly between the huge packing cases piled
outside the newly constructed hangar, he saw a shadowy
movement to his left. He raised the deadly ray gun,
and his finger tightened on the trigger.</p>

<p>"Advance and be recognized," he said over the sights
of the gun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Mee-ooo-wwww!</i>"</p>

<p>A tiny white kitten flashed out of a gap between two
boxes and ran to his feet, purring, rubbing up against
his space boots.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-048.png" width="500" height="415" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, blast my rockets!" Roger laughed. He slung
the gun over his shoulder and reached down to pick the
kitten up in his arms. He began stroking its fur and
making little soothing noises. He started back to the
other end of his patrol post.</p>

<p>"You're a cute little fella," murmured Roger, nuzzling
the kitten against his chin. "But you almost got blasted."</p>

<p>"Guard! Stand to!"</p>

<p>Startled, Roger whirled around to see Firehouse Tim
behind him, his battered and beaten face clouded with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
rage. "Drop that animal at once," the petty officer
roared.</p>

<p>Roger stooped over to let the kitten run free and it
dashed away into a crack between the boxes and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Manning," began the enlisted spaceman, "the next
time I catch you not attending to your duty, I will bring
you up on charges of neglect! Carry on!" Rush spun on
his heel and vanished into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Blasted muscle-bound squirt!" sneered Roger under
his breath, shouldering his rifle and resuming his slow
patrol outside the hangar.</p>

<p>For three weeks, Tom, Roger, and Astro, along with
the three members of the <i>Capella</i> unit, had been spending
close to eight hours a day on guard duty, eight to
ten hours a day in classroom work, and the rest of the
time studying. They only averaged some two to three
hours of sleep per day. They were dead tired but they
stuck to their task doggedly, without complaint.</p>

<p>Around them, the work on Professor Hemmingwell's
project had proceeded with amazing speed. The tunnel
promised by Dave Barret had been finished in less than
five days, with the rail for the monorail spur installed
overhead as each yard of the shaft was completed. In
the second week, scores of cars loaded with building
materials began rolling into the deserted plain several
miles away from Space Academy. Then, one morning,
nearly a thousand construction workers arrived and
built a hangar in thirty-six hours. No sooner had the
huge building been completed than a tight guard had
been placed around it. Specially designed identification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
tags were issued to the guards and workers on the project.
Gradually the huge store of cases and boxes outside
the hangar had been moved inside, with all but a
few of the smaller ones remaining outside. The secret
work inside the hangar was advancing rapidly, but this
did not enter into the thoughts of the three cadets of
the <i>Polaris</i> unit, nor of the <i>Capella</i> unit. The harsh discipline
instituted by Tim Rush and the extra study necessary
for the end-of-year exams had forced the cadets
into a round-the-clock struggle not only to keep awake
but to make the class promotion lists.</p>

<p>Roger paced off the required distance, wheeled
smartly, and in so doing came face to face with Astro,
who was patrolling another side of the hangar.</p>

<p>"I just saw Firehouse," said Astro quietly. "Did he
catch you goofing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," growled Roger. "I found a kitten and he
walked up just as I was holding it."</p>

<p>Astro grinned. "I wouldn't be surprised if that
pocket-sized giant didn't send that cat down there to
tempt you."</p>

<p>"How's Tom?" asked Roger. Astro, in his patrol,
came in contact with both unit mates.</p>

<p>"Sleepy. He's having a tough time with that chapter
on space law. He didn't sleep at all last night."</p>

<p>"He better keep awake," said Roger. "That little fireman's
got his rockets hot tonight. He'll blast Tom sure
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Astro suddenly, looking off into
the darkness. "What was that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger spun around, his rifle in his hands, ready to
fire. "What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Astro in a whisper. "I thought
I saw something move inside the hangar." He pointed
to a large window. "Sort of a shadow against the frosted
glass."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'm sure."</p>

<p>"I'll investigate. You get Tom and call Firehouse."</p>

<p>"Right," replied Astro, and raced down the path,
alongside the hangar.</p>

<p>Grasping his rifle firmly, Roger inched toward a
nearby door. He opened it a crack, then flattened
himself against the wall and watched Astro run toward the
other end of the hangar. He saw the big Venusian say a
few quick words to Tom and then rush off toward the
guardhouse and the communicator. Tom waved to
Roger, indicating that he would enter the opposite door
of the hangar.</p>

<p>Roger dropped to his hands and knees and poked his
head through the open door, peering around from one
end of the huge dark chamber to the other. Then, taking
a deep breath, he rose and stepped quickly inside.
He closed the door behind him and stood still, listening
for some sound.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a flash of light from the opposite
wall. Roger brought the paralo-ray gun up to his shoulder
quickly and was about to fire when he realized that
the light he saw was Tom opening the door on the
opposite side. He breathed easier and waited until he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
could distinguish Tom's moving figure clearly, and then
walked stealthily forward on a parallel line.</p>

<p>It was the first time Roger had been inside the
hangar since it had been constructed and he was not
sure of his way around, but gradually, the moonlight filtering
in through the frosted plates of Titan crystal illuminated
the huge forms of the machines around him.</p>

<p>He stopped and gasped. Without even realizing it, he
emitted a long whistle of astonishment. Before him,
reaching up into the shadows of the cavernous hangar,
was the gleaming hull of a huge rocket ship. Two hundred
feet long, the space vessel stood on its stabilizer
fins, ladders and cables running into the open ports on
both sides.</p>

<p>Roger waved to Tom, who had also stopped to stare
at the giant spaceship, and the two of them met beneath
the gleaming hull.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Tom. "Astro said you saw
someone."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> didn't see a blasted thing," said Roger in an exasperated
whisper. "That big goof said <i>he</i> did."</p>

<p>"Wow!" said Tom, looking up at the ship. "This is
some baby. I never saw one with lines like that before.
Look at the funny bulges on the lower side of the hull."</p>

<p>"Sh!" hissed Roger. "I just heard something."</p>

<p>The two cadets stood silently, ears cocked for the
slightest sound in the huge hangar. They heard a distinct
tapping sound from somewhere above them.</p>

<p>"It's coming from inside the ship!" said Tom.</p>

<p>"You climb in the other port," said Roger. "I'll take
this one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right," said Tom. "And remember, if there's any
trouble, shoot first and ask questions later."</p>

<p>"Check."</p>

<p>Tom slipped away from Roger and moved to the opposite
side of the ship. Slinging the rifle over his shoulder,
he climbed up the ladder silently toward the open
port.</p>

<p>Making his way noiselessly through the air lock, he
entered the huge main deck of the ship and was able to
see his way around by the faint glow of the emergency
reflectors in the bulkheads. Tiny, sparkling gemlike
pieces of specially coated Titan crystal, they glowed
with steady intensity for many hours after having been
exposed to any form of light. The deck was a mass of
cables, boxes, tools, and equipment. Tom noticed curious-looking
machines behind, what he judged to be, the
odd bulges on the outside of the hull. Ahead of him, a
hatch was partially open and he could see light streaking
through the opening. He gripped his rifle tightly,
finger on the trigger, and moved forward.</p>

<p>At the hatch he paused and looked into the next compartment.
From the opposite side, he saw another hatch
partially open and the outline of Roger's head and
shoulders. Between them, a man was bending over a
makeshift desk, copying information from a calculator
and a set of blueprints. Tom nodded across to Roger
and they both stepped into the compartment at the
same time.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands, mister, or I'll freeze you so hard
it'll take a summer on the Venus equator to warm you
up," Roger drawled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The man jerked upright, stumbled back from the
desk, and moved toward Tom, keeping his eyes on
Roger. He backed into the barrel of Tom's ray gun and
stopped, terrified. He threw up his hands.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;wh&mdash;" he stammered and then caught himself.
"How dare you do this to me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Tom. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," the man replied.</p>

<p>"I'm making it my business," snapped Tom, pressing
the gun into the man's back. "Who are you and how did
you get in here?"</p>

<p>The man turned and looked Tom in the eye. "I have
a right to be here," he stated coldly. "I'll show you my
identification&mdash;" He brought his hands down and
reached into his jacket, but Roger stepped over quickly
and brought the barrel of his gun down sharply on the
man's head. He slumped to the floor with a groan and
was still.</p>

<p>"What did you do that for?" growled Tom.</p>

<p>Roger didn't reply. He reached down into the unconscious
man's jacket and pulled out a small paralo-ray
gun stuck in the top of his waistband. "Some identification,"
Roger drawled.</p>

<p>"Thanks, pal," said Tom sheepishly. "Let's search
him. Maybe we can find out who he is."</p>

<p>As Roger bent over the fallen man, there was a commotion
in the hangar outside the ship, followed by the
sound of footsteps clattering up the ladders to the ports.
Seconds later, Astro, followed by Tim Rush and a squad
of enlisted spacemen, surged into the compartment.
Rush stopped short when he saw the man on the floor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great jumping Jupiter," gasped the petty officer,
then whirled on Tom and Roger. "You space-blasted
idiots!" he shouted. "You good-for-nothing harebrained,
moronic dumbbells! Do you know what you've done?"</p>

<p>Tom and Roger stared at each other in amazement.
Astro, standing to one side, looked confused.</p>

<p>"Sure we know what we've done," declared Tom.
"We found this guy in here copying secrets from some
blueprints there on the desk and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Copying secrets!" screamed Rush. "Why, you ding-blasted
idiots, that's Dave Barret, the supervisor of this
whole project!"</p>

<p>The man on the floor stirred and Firehouse ordered
the squad of enlisted men to help him up. Just then,
there was a bellow of rage from the hatch. Major Connel
stepped into the compartment, his face a mask of
disgust and anger.</p>

<p>"By the rings of Saturn!" he roared. "I've been sitting
in the laboratory for the last hour and a half waiting for
Dave Barret to come back with vital information, so we
could get on with our experiments, and I find that you&mdash;you&mdash;"
Connel was so furious, he could hardly talk.</p>

<p>He faced the three cadets. "There isn't anything in
the books that says you should be disciplined for this&mdash;this&mdash;outrage,
but believe me, Cadets"&mdash;his voice
sounded like thunder in the small compartment&mdash;"this
is the very last time I'll stand for this kind of stupidity."</p>

<p>Tom gulped but stepped forward bravely. "Sir," he
said clearly, "I would like respectfully to submit the
facts for the major's honest consideration. Neither of us
has ever seen this man before and we found him copying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
information from these blueprints. When I challenged
him, he said he was going to show us his identification.
He put his hands in his jacket to get it, but
Roger saw a gun in his belt, and thinking he was going
to use it, Roger hit him on the head." Tom stopped,
clamped his mouth shut, and stared the major in the
eye. "That's all, sir."</p>

<p>Connel returned the stare, his eyes meeting those of
the cadet for a full half minute. "All right," he said finally.
"I guess it's just a case of misjudgment. But," he
added scathingly, "in the face of the <i>Polaris</i> unit's record,
you can understand my initial opinion."</p>

<p>As Dave Barret was assisted from the ship by the
guards, Connel turned to Rush. "Firehouse!" he barked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"See that these cadets don't cause any more mischief."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>."</p>

<p>"Dismissed," snapped Connel.</p>

<p>"All right, you space brats," bellowed Rush, "back to
your patrol!"</p>

<p>Tom, Roger, and Astro left the ship and returned to
their posts outside the hangar. Just before they separated
to resume their endless march around the hangar,
Tom winked at his unit mates. "At least we didn't get
demerits," he said.</p>

<p>"Only because Connel couldn't find any reason to
give them to us," sneered Roger. "What a busted rocket
he's getting to be!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Astro quietly.</p>

<p>The three cadets began their round again, their eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
heavy with lack of sleep, their arms and legs leaden,
and their desire to become successful Space Cadets
more determined than ever. But they didn't know they
had started a chain reaction that would affect their very
lives.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_5" id="CHAPTER_5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>


<p>"We passed!"</p>

<p>Tom turned away from the lists posted on the dormitory
bulletin board and with his arms around Astro and
Roger pushed through the knot of cadets.</p>

<p>"Yeow!" bellowed Astro.</p>

<p>"We made it," murmured Roger with a note of disbelief
in his voice. "We made it!" And then, with the
realization that he was still a Space Cadet for at least
another term, he turned and began pounding Astro on
the back. "You big Venusian ape, we made it."</p>

<p>Arm in arm, the three cadets strolled across the quadrangle
and shouted to friends they passed. Occasionally
they fell silent when they saw a boy carrying his gear to
the supply building. These had failed to pass the rigid
examinations.</p>

<p>Near the Tower of Galileo, the cadets came face to
face with Tony Richards, McAvoy, and Davison. The
two units looked at each other silently, remembering
what had happened only four short weeks before. Then
they all smiled and pounded each other on the back,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
congratulating each other on passing. Neither of the
units had made top honors as a result of their fight and
the trial, and having to spend so much time on guard
duty, but they had passed and that was the most important
thing. The boys all adjourned to the credit exchange
and gorged themselves on Martian fruit pies
covered with ice cream. Finally the party broke up
when Tom remembered that he and his unit mates had
to go on guard duty in half an hour.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tony Richards, rising, "we relieve you
guys at midnight, so we might as well hit the sack right
now. I've been waiting for this night for a long time."</p>

<p>"No study," sighed Davison. "What heaven! I feel as
if I've been pardoned from prison."</p>

<p>The three boys of the <i>Capella</i> crew said good-by to
Tom, Roger, and Astro, and walked off. Tom settled
back in his chair and sighed. "Sure wish I was in their
boots," he said. "I don't see how I'm going to get
through tonight."</p>

<p>"Don't think about it," said Roger. "Only seven more
days to go, and then we go on summer cruise with the
<i>Polaris</i>."</p>

<p>"I can't wait to get back on that power deck," said
Astro. "It'll be like going home."</p>

<p>Later, riding the new slidewalk to the area where the
huge hangar had been built, they saw Captain Strong
returning from the restricted area on the other slidewalk.
They hopped off their walk and waited for the
young officer.</p>

<p>"I'm happy that you passed the exams, boys," he said.
"And I want you to know Commander Walters and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Major Connel think a lot more of you, though they
wouldn't admit it, for the way you worked to make it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Astro respectfully.</p>

<p>"You'll have to excuse us, sir," said Tom. "We've got
to get out to the hangar and go on guard."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you'd better hurry," said Strong. "After that
mix-up with Dave Barret, Firehouse Tim has his eye on
you. Barret put up quite a fuss about it."</p>

<p>"I still don't see how Mr. Barret got in there," said
Tom. "The fourth side of the hangar faces the hills, and
we three covered the other three sides."</p>

<p>"However he got in," interrupted Strong, "he had a
right to be there. And he also had a right to carry sidearms."</p>

<p>"Captain Strong," said Roger, "we've talked about it
a lot, the three of us. And we decided that regardless
of what Major Connel or Firehouse or Barret have said,
we'd do the same thing, in the same way again."</p>

<p>"I think you're perfectly right, Manning. But don't
quote me," said Strong, his voice serious. "This is one of
the most important projects I've ever been connected
with and&mdash;" He stopped suddenly. "Well, I can't tell
you any more. That's how tight the security is on it."</p>

<p>"But everyone knows that it's a projectile that will
home on a target, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was given to the stereos for general news
release, but there are other factors involved, factors so
important that they could revolutionize the whole concept
of space flight."</p>

<p>"Wow!" said Tom. "No wonder they have this place
so well guarded."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph," snorted Roger. "I'd give up the opportunity
of guarding this revolutionary secret for one
night's good sleep."</p>

<p>"You'll get that tomorrow when we go off duty," said
Tom. "And please, Roger, no blunders tonight, eh? Let's
not take any chances of losing the summer cruise in the
<i>Polaris</i>."</p>

<p>"Listen! You want to talk to the Venusian hick about
that, not me," declared Roger. "He's the one that
spotted Barret."</p>

<p>"But you hit him on the head," growled Astro. "You
and your catlike reflexes." The big cadet referred to a
recent letter he had seen in which one of the blond-haired
cadet's many space dolls referred to his sensitivity
as being that of a poet, and his dancing as smooth as
the reflexes of a cat.</p>

<p>Roger spun on the big cadet. "You blasted throwback
to a Venusian ape!" he roared. "If I ever catch you reading
my mail again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll what?" growled Astro. "You'll do just exactly
what?" He grabbed Roger by the arm and held him
straight out, so that he looked as if he were hanging
from a tree.</p>

<p>Strong laughed and shook his head. "I give you three
to the loving, tender care of Firehouse Tim," he said,
hopping over on the moving slidewalk, back to the
Academy.</p>

<p>"Put me down, you overgrown idiot," Roger howled.</p>

<p>"Not until you promise not to threaten me with violence
again," said Astro with a wink at Tom. The young
curly-haired cadet doubled up with laughter. Finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Roger was lowered to the ground, and, though he
rubbed his shoulder and grumbled, he was really
pleased that Astro felt like roughhousing with him. The
events of the last few weeks had so tired all of them
that there had been no energy left for play.</p>

<p>Lightheartedly they stepped over to the slidewalk
and were back on their way to the secret project.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two huge wire fences had been built around the
hangar area now, fences carrying a surge of paralyzing
power ready to greet anyone that dared touch it. More
than twenty feet high, the outer fence was buried six
feet into the ground and was some hundred yards away
from the hangar building itself, and fifty yards away
from the second fence. The entire area was also guarded
by radar. Should any unauthorized person or object be
found in that area, an automatic alarm sounded and in
fifteen seconds a hundred fully armed guards were
ready for action. The men who had been cleared by
security to work in and around the restricted area wore
specially designed belts of sensitized metal that offset
the effects of the radar. But the fence was still the untouchable
for everyone.</p>

<p>Tom, Roger, and Astro had now been moved inside
the hangar itself, to stand guard over the only three
doors in the cavernous structure. They were armed with
powerful heat blasters. These rifles were different from
the paralo-ray guns they had used previously. A beam
of light from the ray guns would only paralyze a human
being, while the blaster destroyed anything it touched,
burning it to a crisp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the three cadets saw the change in armament,
they knew they were guarding something so secret
that human life, if it interfered with the project,
would be disintegrated. Only once before, on a hunting
trip to Venus, had they ever used the blasters, but they
knew the deadly power of the weapons.</p>

<p>Nothing was said to them. Firehouse Tim had not
posted any special orders or given them any special instructions.
Each man who worked inside the hangar
had to pass a simple but telling test of identification. On
a table at each entrance to the hangar was a small box
with a hole in the top. Each worker, guard, and person
that entered the hangar had to insert a key into the
hole and it made contact with a highly sensitive electronic
device inside. The keys were issued only by Major
Connel or Captain Strong, and should anyone attempt
to enter the hangar without it, or should the key
not make the proper contact, lighting up a small bulb
on the top of the box, Tom, Roger, and Astro had simple
instructions: Shoot to kill.</p>

<p>This form of identification had been employed for
some time now, even before the wire fence had been
installed, but the really spectacular change was in the
heat blasters each guard carried. This, more than anything
else, impressed on everyone connected with the
project, that to move the wrong way, to say the wrong
thing, or to act in any suspicious manner might result
in instant death.</p>

<p>It was a mark of trust that Tom, Roger, and Astro had
been placed in such a highly sensitive position. They
could kill a man and simply explain, "The light didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
go on!" and that would be the end of it. Neither of them
knew that Connel had specifically requested that they
be assigned to the day shift, when the hangar would be
crowded with workers, who, intent on their assigned
jobs, might be careless and leave themselves open to instant
action on the part of the guards. Connel reasoned
that Tom, Roger, and Astro, aside from their occasional
antics in the Academy, would be more responsible than
rough enlisted spacemen. The orders were specific:
shoot to kill, but there was almost always one poor human
being who would forget. In spite of the necessity
for tight security, Connel felt he had to allow for that
one percent of human failure. Secretly he was very
happy that he had a crack unit like the <i>Polaris</i> to place
in such a job. And the <i>Capella</i> unit had been entrusted
with the same responsibility.</p>

<p>It was under such tight conditions that Astro, watching
the least busy of the three entrances and exits, saw
Dave Barret walk to a nearby public teleceiver booth,
and, with the door ajar, place a transspace call to
Venusport.</p>

<p>The booth was used often by the workers and Astro
did not think much of it, until he accidentally overheard
Barret's conversation.</p>

<p>"... Yeah, I know, but things are so tight, I can't
even begin to get at it." Barret had his mouth close to
the transmitter and his voice was low, but Astro could
still hear him. "Yeah, I know how important it is to you,
but I can be burned to a cinder if I make one false move.
You'll just have to wait until I find an opening somewhere.
Good-by!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Barret switched off the teleceiver set and stepped out
of the booth to face the muzzle of Astro's blaster. "Stand
where you are!" growled the big cadet.</p>

<p>"What, why you&mdash;" Barret clamped his mouth shut.
There was a difference between being frozen and being
blasted into a crisp.</p>

<p>Astro reached over and touched the button that
would alert a squad of guards, Major Connel, and Tim
Rush. In a flash the alarm sounded throughout the
hangar and troopers stormed in brandishing their guns.
Firehouse Tim and Connel arrived seconds later. They
skidded to a stop when they saw Barret with his hands
in the air and Astro's finger on the trigger of the blaster.</p>

<p>"By the blessed rings of Saturn!" roared Connel. "Not
again."</p>

<p>"Put down that gun," demanded Rush, stepping forward
quickly. Astro lowered the gun and Barret
dropped his hands.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" demanded Connel, his
face reddening with rage.</p>

<p>Astro turned and looked the major right in the eye.
"Major," he said calmly, "this man just made a teleceiver
call&mdash;a transspace call to Venusport."</p>

<p>"Well, what about it?" cried Barret.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Astro, unruffled by Barret's screaming protest,
"this man spoke of getting at something, and that
he was unable to do so, because he might be burned to
a cinder. And the other party would have to wait until
he found an opening."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Connel, turning to look at Barret.
"What is the meaning of this, Barret?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, that knuckle-headed baboon!" yelled Barret.
"Sure, I made a transspace call to Venusport&mdash;to the
Venusian Atomic By-Products Corporation."</p>

<p>"What was the call about?" demanded Connel.</p>

<p>The guards had not moved and the workers in the
hangar were now gathering around the small knot of
men by the teleceiver booth.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on, man!" shouted Connel. "Out with it."</p>

<p>"I called about getting a new timer for the projectile
fuel-injection system," snapped Barret. "The timer is too
slow for our needs. I wanted to adjust it myself, but the
projectile is so compact, I can't get at it without taking
a chance of getting doused by the fuel."</p>

<p>"What about that remark about finding an opening?"
growled Connel.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" called Professor Hemmingwell
as he bustled up to the group. "Why aren't these
men working? Dave, why aren't you up there&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Professor!" Connel barked, and
turned back to Barret. "Go ahead, Barret."</p>

<p>"They can't make a new timer until I find a way of
installing it without taking apart the whole projectile,"
said Barret, adding sarcastically, "in other words, Major&mdash;finding
an opening."</p>

<p>"All right," barked Connel. "That's enough." He
turned to the assembled workers. "Get back to work, all
of you." The men moved away and Firehouse Tim led
the guards back to their quarters. Professor Hemmingwell,
Barret, and Astro remained where they were.</p>

<p>Connel turned to Astro. "Good work, you dumb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Venusian," he snorted. "But so help me, if you had
burned this man, I, personally, would've buried you on
a prison rock." The major then turned to Barret. "As for
you&mdash;" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Yes?" asked Barret coolly.</p>

<p>"You make one more call like that over a public
teleceiver," Connel roared, "especially a transspace call
that's monitored by the idiots in the teleceiver company,
and I'll send <i>you</i> to a prison asteroid!"</p>

<p>"Now, Major," said Hemmingwell testily, "I don't
think you should speak to Dave that way. After all, he's
a very valuable man in this project."</p>

<p>"How valuable would he be if this cadet had gone
ahead and blasted him?" snarled Connel.</p>

<p>"It's just another example of how these stupid boys
have obstructed my work here," replied Hemmingwell
angrily. "I can't see why they have to interfere this
way. And they always pick on poor Dave."</p>

<p>"Yes," snarled Barret. "I'm getting pretty tired of
being a clay pigeon for a bunch of brats." He turned to
Astro. "You'll have a head full of socket wrench if you
mess with me again."</p>

<p>"You'll get a receipt, Barret," growled Astro. "Paid in
full."</p>

<p>"All right, break it up," growled Connel. "Back to
your post, Astro. And you get back to work, Barret, and
remember what I said about using that public
teleceiver."</p>

<p>Barret and Hemmingwell walked off, with the little
professor talking rapidly to the younger scientist, trying
to calm his anger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Astro, Tom, and Roger were extraordinarily strict
about the exit of the workers that night and there was
angry muttering in the ranks of the men who wanted
to get home. But the three cadets refused to be hurried
and made each man perform the ritual of getting out
to the letter. Still later, after they had been relieved by
the <i>Capella</i> unit and had told them of the incident
between Astro and Barret, they headed back to the Academy
dormitory more tired than they had ever been before
in their lives. Thirty seconds after reaching their
room, they were asleep in their bunks, without undressing
or washing. Like whipped dogs, they sprawled on
their bunks, dead to the world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_6" id="CHAPTER_6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>


<p>Sabotage!</p>

<p>Major Connel, Commander Walters, Captain Strong,
Professor Hemmingwell, and Dave Barret stared
unbelievingly at the tangle of wires and smashed tubes on
the main deck of the sleek spaceship.</p>

<p>"Get every man that has been in this hangar during
the last twenty-four hours and have him brought under
guard to the laboratory for psychographs." Commander
Walters' face was grim as he snapped out the order.</p>

<p>Professor Hemmingwell and Barret got down on
their hands and knees and examined the wrecked firing
device carefully. After a long period of silence, while
Strong, Walters, and Connel watched them pawing
through the tangle of wires and broken connections,
Hemmingwell stood up.</p>

<p>"It can be replaced in twelve hours," he announced.
"I believe that whoever did this either didn't know
what he was doing, or it was an accident."</p>

<p>"Explain that, will you, Professor?" asked Strong. "I
don't understand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is an important unit," Hemmingwell replied,
indicating the wreckage, "but not the most important
part of the whole unit. Anyone who really knew what
he was doing and wanted to delay the project could
have done so much more easily by simply destroying
this." Hemmingwell held out a small metallic-looking
cylinder.</p>

<p>"What is that, Professor?" asked Barret.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't," snapped Professor Hemmingwell.
"This is something I developed that only the
commander and myself know about."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-070.png" width="500" height="413" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"So, if you and Commander Walters are the only ones
that know about it," said Steve Strong slowly, "then a
saboteur would have thought it unimportant and
concentrated on the rest of the mechanism."</p>

<p>"Looks that way," mused Connel. "But there is still
the possibility that it was an accident, as the professor
said."</p>

<p>Strong looked at Connel questioningly and then back
to the wreckage. The unit had been hurled from the
upper deck of the spaceship, down to the main deck,
and it looked as if someone had trampled on its delicate
works.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-071.png" width="500" height="407" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I'll have a crew put right to work on this," said Hemmingwell.</p>

<p>"Commander," Connel suddenly announced, "I'm going
ahead with my trip to Mars to inspect the testing
receivers. I don't think this incident is serious enough
for me to delay leaving, and if Professor Hemmingwell
and his men can get this unit back in operation in
twelve hours, then there's very little time lost and we
can go ahead with the tests on schedule."</p>

<p>"All right, Lou," said Walters. "Do whatever you
think best. I'll have a ship made ready for you at the
Academy spaceport any time you want to leave."</p>

<p>Connel nodded his thanks. "I think I'll take the
<i>Polaris</i>, with Cadet Corbett along as second pilot," he
said. "I'm getting too old to make a solo hop in a scout
all the way to Mars. I need my rest." He grinned slyly
at Walters.</p>

<p>"Rest," Walters snorted. "If I know you, Lou Connel,
you'll be up all night working out standard operational
procedures for the space projectiles." He turned to
Strong. "He's so sure this will work that he's already
writing a preliminary handbook for the enlisted
personnel."</p>

<p>Strong turned and looked at the major, amazed.
Every day he learned more and more about the
space-hardened veteran.</p>

<p>Connel turned to Strong. "Will you give Corbett the
order to be ready at 0600 hours tomorrow morning,
Steve?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Lou," replied Strong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>As the major turned away, Walters called after him,
"Take it easy."</p>

<p>Leaving Hemmingwell and Barret to take care of
clearing away the wreckage, Strong and Walters
climbed out of the ship, left the hangar, and headed for
the Academy.</p>

<p>"Do you think it was sabotage, sir?" asked Strong, as
they rode on the slidewalk.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Steve," said the commander. "If that
special unit of Hemmingwell's had been damaged, I
would say it might have been an accident. But the
things that were damaged would have put the whole
works out of commission if we didn't have that unit."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Strong grimly. "So the man who did it
thought he was doing a complete job."</p>

<p>"Right," said Walters. "Assuming that it was sabotage."</p>

<p>"Anyone you suspect?"</p>

<p>"Not a living soul," replied Walters. "Every man in
that hangar has been carefully screened by our Security
Section. Background, history, everything. No, I think
it really was an accident."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Strong, but not with the conviction
he would like to have felt.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Pat Troy had been Professor Hemmingwell's foreman
for nearly two years. It was his job to read the complicated
blueprints and keep the construction and installation
work proceeding on schedule. Troy lacked a formal
education, but nevertheless he could read and interpret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the complicated plans which the professor and his
assistants drew up, and transform their ideas into actual
mechanical devices. Professor Hemmingwell considered
himself fortunate to have a man of Troy's ability not
only as a co-worker, but as a close friend.</p>

<p>But Dave Barret did not like Troy, and he made this
dislike obvious by giving Troy as much work as possible,
mainly tasks that were beneath his ability, claiming
he only trusted the trained scientists. Barret put the
professor in the position of having to defend one to the
other. He needed both men, both being excellent in
their respective fields, and found it more and more difficult
to maintain any kind of peaceful relationship between
them. Barret, as Hemmingwell's chief assistant
and supervisor of the project, was naturally superior in
rank to Troy, and made the most of it. A placid, easy-going
man, Troy took Barret's gibes and caustic comments
in silence, doing his work and getting it finished
on time. But occasionally he had difficulty in controlling
his resentment.</p>

<p>The day after the accident, or sabotage attempt on
the firing unit, the hangar was quiet, most of the workers
still being psychographed. Troy, one of the first to
be graphed, had been detained by the technicians
longer than usual, but was now back at his bench, working
on the unit. This incident gave Barret the opportunity
he was looking for, and as he and Professor
Hemmingwell strode through the hangar, he commented
casually, "I hate to say this, sir, but I don't like the way
Troy has been acting lately."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Dave?" asked Hemmingwell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I depend a great deal on instinct," replied Barret.
"And as good as Troy's work has been, I feel the man is
hiding something."</p>

<p>"Come now, Dave," snorted the professor. "I've
known him a long time. I think you're being a little
harsh."</p>

<p>As Barret shrugged and didn't reply, a troubled expression
crossed Hemmingwell's face. "But at the same
time," he said slowly, "if you have any reservations, I
don't suppose it would hurt to keep an eye on him."</p>

<p>"Yes!" agreed Barret eagerly. "That's just what I was
thinking."</p>

<p>They reached the workbench where Troy, a small
man with powerful arms and shoulders, was working on
a complicated array of wires and vacuum tubes. He
looked up, nodded casually at the two men, and
indicated the instrument.</p>

<p>"Here it is, Professor," he said. "All ready to go. But
I had a little trouble fitting that coil where the
blueprints called for it."</p>

<p>"Why?" Barret demanded. "I designed that coil myself.
Isn't it a little odd that a coil I designed, and the
professor O.K.'d, should not fit?"</p>

<p>"I don't care who designed it," said Troy easily. "It
didn't fit where the blueprint indicated. I had to
redesign it."</p>

<p>"Now, now," said Professor Hemmingwell, sensing
trouble. "Take it easy, boys."</p>

<p>"Professor," Barret exploded, "I insist that you fire
this man!"</p>

<p>"Fire me!" exclaimed Troy angrily. "Why, you space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
crawler, you're the one who should be fired. I saw you
come back to the hangar the other night alone and...."</p>

<p>"Of course I did!" snapped Barret. "I was sent down
here to get information about&mdash;" He stopped suddenly
and eyed Troy. "Wait a minute. How could you see me
down here? What were you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I&mdash;" Troy hesitated. "I came down to check
over some equipment."</p>

<p>"Why were you detained at the psychograph tests
this morning?" demanded Barret.</p>

<p>"None of your business!" shouted Troy. "I was doing
my job. That's all."</p>

<p>"I'll bet," snapped Barret. "Professor, here is your
sabotage agent. Who are you working for, Troy?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," stammered Troy, seemingly
confused. "I mean, I'm not working for anyone."</p>

<p>"There! You see, Professor!" shouted Barret.</p>

<p>"I think you'd better explain yourself, Pat," said the
professor, looking troubled and suspicious. "Why were
you detained so long this morning?"</p>

<p>"They were asking me questions."</p>

<p>"What kind of questions?" demanded Barret.</p>

<p>"I'm not allowed to tell you."</p>

<p>"What were you doing here the other night?" pursued
Barret. "The night you saw me here."</p>

<p>"I came down to check our supplies. I knew that we
were running short on certain equipment."</p>

<p>"What kind of things?" demanded the professor.</p>

<p>"Well, the timers on the oscillators," Troy replied. "I
knew we would need them for the new units you and
Commander Walters were planning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guard!" shouted Barret suddenly. "Guard!" He
turned and called to Roger and Astro, who were standing
guard at the doors. They both came running up,
their blasters held at ready.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Astro. "What's going on
here?"</p>

<p>"Arrest that man!" shouted Barret. Astro and Roger
looked questioningly at Troy. They did not know him
personally but had seen him around the hangar and
knew that he worked closely with the professor and
Barret.</p>

<p>Still vaguely distrustful of Barret's behavior, Astro
turned to Hemmingwell. "How about it, Professor?" he
asked. "Do we haul this guy in?"</p>

<p>Hemmingwell looked at Troy steadily. "Pat, you
knew about that new unit I was building?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Troy forthrightly. "I accidentally
overheard you and Commander Walters discussing it.
From what you said about it, I knew you would need
new timers for the oscillators&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roger and Astro had heard about the vital unit that
had not been destroyed, and realized that Troy was
admitting to knowledge he shouldn't have had. Roger
raised the blaster menacingly. "All right, buster!" he
growled. "Move this way and move slowly."</p>

<p>"Professor," exclaimed Troy, "you're not going to let
them&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Pat," said the professor, a dejected look in
his eyes. "I have nothing to do with it now. You should
have told me that you knew about the new unit. And
the fact that you were here the night it was destroyed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
well&mdash;" He shrugged meaningfully and turned away.</p>

<p>"All right, buster," growled Astro, "do you move or
do I move you? It makes no difference to me."</p>

<p>Troy took a look at the blasters leveled at him and
silently walked between them to the hangar door.
Barret and Professor Hemmingwell remained at the
workbench, following the trio with their eyes.</p>

<p>Later, after Troy had been safely locked in the Academy
brig, Firehouse Tim Rush sat at his desk in the
small security shack taking down the two cadets'
reports.</p>

<p>"... And upon the orders of Dave Barret and
Professor Hummingbird&mdash;" Roger was saying.</p>

<p>"Hemmingwell," snapped Firehouse. "<i>Hemmingwell</i>."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Hemmingwell"&mdash;nodded Roger with a wink at
Astro&mdash;"we brought the suspect to the officer of the
guard, Firehouse Tim Rush."</p>

<p>"Can that Firehouse, ya squirt!" growled Rush. "Only
my friends can call me that. And you two are not in that
classification."</p>

<p>"O.K., Fireman," said Roger. "I can call you
Fireman, can't I? After all, you are a pretty hot rocket,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get back to your posts!" roared Firehouse Tim in his
loudest voice.</p>

<p>Roger and Astro grinned and hurried out of the small
building. Before resuming their posts in the hangar, the
two cadets stopped at an automatic soda dispenser. As
they drank slowly, they looked around the hangar. The
project was back in full operation now. The workers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
that had been cleared had heard about the arrest of
their foreman, and there seemed to be more talk than
work.</p>

<p>Dave Barret walked over to Roger and Astro. Nodding
in a surprisingly friendly fashion, he said, "I want
to commend you two boys on your good work a while
ago. I think that traitor would have tried anything if
you hadn't been there. He might even have tried to kill
me or the professor."</p>

<p>Roger and Astro mumbled curt thanks for the compliment.</p>

<p>Barret looked at them quizzically. "No need for us to
be angry with each other," he said smoothly. "I realize
that when we had our two little run-ins you were carrying
out your duties, and I apologize for behaving the
way I did. How about it? Can we shake and forget it?"
He held out his hand. Astro and Roger looked at each
other and shrugged, each in turn, taking the young
man's hand.</p>

<p>"You know," said Barret, "I've heard a lot about you
three cadets of the <i>Polaris</i> unit. Especially you, Manning.
I understand that you know almost as much about
electronics as your instructor at the Academy."</p>

<p>Roger grinned shyly. "I like my work."</p>

<p>"Well, blast my jets!" roared Astro. "That's the first
time I have ever heard Manning accept a compliment
gracefully." The big Venusian turned to Barret. "He is
not only the finest astrogator in the whole high, wide,
and deep," he said sincerely, "but he could have had a
wonderful career in electronics if he didn't want to be
a rocket jockey with me and Corbett."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that so?" murmured Barret politely. "Well,
Manning, you must have some ideas about the work that's
going on here."</p>

<p>"I sure have," said Roger. "And I see a lot of things
here that could be done a lot easier."</p>

<p>"Hum," mused Barret. "You know something. I think
I might be able to relieve you two of guard duty. After
all, if Corbett can get out of it, I don't see why I can't
put your talents to work for us here. How about it?"</p>

<p>Both boys almost jumped straight up in the air.</p>

<p>"That would be terrific, Mr. Barret!" exclaimed Astro.</p>

<p>"Call me Dave, Astro. We're friends now, remember?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Dave," stuttered Astro. "But listen, we'd do
anything to be taken off this detail and get Firehouse
off our necks."</p>

<p>Barret smiled. "All right. I'll see what I can do." He
turned and walked off, giving them a friendly wave in
parting.</p>

<p>Astro and Roger could hardly believe their luck.
They returned to their posts and took up guard duty
again with light hearts.</p>

<p>In his small private office, Barret watched them
through the open door to the hangar and then turned
to his desk, to pick up the recently installed private
audioceiver. He asked for a private number in a small
city on Mars, and then admonished the operator, "This
is a security call, miss. Disconnect your circuit and do
not listen in. Failure to comply will result in your
immediate dismissal and possible criminal prosecution."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the operator respectfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a distinct click and Barret heard a gruff
voice.</p>

<p>"Hello?"</p>

<p>"This is Barret," the young designer whispered. "Everything's
going fine down here. I just had the foreman
arrested to throw them off the track, and I have a plan
to get rid of two of these nosy cadets." Barret listened
a minute and then continued. "Connel and the other
cadet, Corbett, have gone to Mars to inspect the receivers.
Don't worry about a thing. This ship will never
get off the ground. And if it does, it will never fire a
projectile."</p>

<p>Barret hung up and returned to the open door. He
waved at Roger and Astro on the other side of the
hangar and the two cadets waved back.</p>

<p>"Like lambs to the slaughter," he said to himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_7" id="CHAPTER_7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>


<p>"Sound off, Corbett!"</p>

<p>Seated in the pilot's chair on the control deck of the
rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>, Major Connel bellowed the order
into the intercom as he scanned the many dials on the
huge control board.</p>

<p>"One minute to touchdown, sir," reported Tom over
the intercom from the radar bridge of the <i>Polaris</i>.</p>

<p>"One minute to touchdown," repeated Connel.
"Right!"</p>

<p>Connel reached for the switches and levers that
would bring the giant ship to rest on the red planet of
Mars. Even after his many years in the Solar Guard
and thousands of space flights, landing a rocket ship
was still a thrill to the veteran spaceman, and knowing
that he had a good man on the radar deck made it even
more exciting and demanding of his skill.</p>

<p>"Decelerate!" yelled Tom over the intercom.</p>

<p>Connel shut down the main drive rockets and at the
same time opened the nose braking rockets. "Braking
rockets on!" he yelled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"One thousand feet to touchdown," said Tom.</p>

<p>Connel watched the dials spinning before him.</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and fifty feet to touchdown,"
reported Tom.</p>

<p>"Keep counting, Corbett!" yelled Connel enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Five hundred feet!"</p>

<p>Connel quickly cut back the nose braking rockets and
again opened the main drive rockets as the ship
plummeted tailfirst toward the surface of Mars.</p>

<p>"Two hundred feet!" came the warning call over the
intercom.</p>

<p>Connel glanced up at the teleceiver screen over his
head that showed the spaceport below. The concrete
runways and platforms were rushing up to meet the
giant ship. He opened the main rockets full.</p>

<p>"Seventy-five feet! Stand by!" yelled Tom.</p>

<p>Connel's hands flashed over the control panel of the
ship, snapping switches, flipping levers, and turning
dials in an effort to bring the ship to a smooth landing.
There was a sudden roar of rockets and then a gentle
bump.</p>

<p>"Touchdown!" roared Connel.</p>

<p>He flipped off the main switches on the control board,
spun around in his chair, and noted the time on the
astral chronometer. "Touchdown Marsport, 2117!" he
announced.</p>

<p>Tom clambered down the ladder from the radar
bridge and immediately noted the time of arrival in the
logbook. He turned around and saluted the major
sharply. "All secure, sir," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Congratulations on a smooth trip, Corbett," Connel
said. "And thanks for letting me take her in. I know it's
unusual to have the senior officer take over the ship,
but once in a while I get the urge to put my hands on
those controls and&mdash;well&mdash;" Connel paused, fumbling
for words.</p>

<p>Tom was so startled by the major's stumbling attempt
to explain his feelings, he felt himself blush. He had
always suspected the major of being a rocket jockey at
heart and now he was certain. But he would never tell
anyone, not even Roger and Astro about this incident.
It was something he knew that he himself would feel
if he ever got to be as old as Major Connel and had
reached his position. There passed between the officer
and the cadet a sudden feeling of mutual understanding.</p>

<p>"I understand, sir," said Tom quietly.</p>

<p>"Dismissed!" roared Connel, recovering his composure
again, and very conscious that he had exposed his
innermost feelings to the cadet. But he didn't mind too
much. Tom Corbett had proven beyond the shadow of
a doubt that he had the stuff true spacemen are made
of, and because of this, Connel could feel as close to
him as a man near his own age. There was never a breed
of men who were drawn so close together in their love
of work as the spacemen and there was no need for
further explanation.</p>

<p>When they had climbed out of the <i>Polaris</i> and
stepped on the landing ramp at Marsport, Connel and
Tom saw that the ground crews were already checking
over the afterburners and exhaust tubes of the ship. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
young Solar Guard lieutenant, wearing a decidedly
greasy uniform, snapped to attention before Connel.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Slick at your service, sir," he announced.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," bawled Connel, "your uniform is
filthy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I know it is, sir," replied the young officer.
"But I was overhauling a firing unit this morning, sir,
and I guess I got a little dirty."</p>

<p>"That is enlisted man's work, sir," stated Connel. "You
are an officer."</p>

<p>"I know, sir, but&mdash;" Slick stammered. "Well, sir, once
in a while I like to do it myself."</p>

<p>Tom turned away, hiding a smile. The young officer
was expressing the same feelings Connel himself had
uttered just a few minutes before. Connel cleared his
throat, and with a sidelong glance at Tom and a wink,
dismissed the young officer, ordering him to have a jet
car sent for them right away.</p>

<p>"Take mine, sir," said the young officer, happy to
have escaped Connel's wrath so easily. It was not too
long ago that he had been a cadet at the Academy and
he remembered all too clearly what Connel could do
when he was mad.</p>

<p>When the jet car was brought up, Tom slipped behind
the wheel, and with Connel seated beside him, he
sent the sleek little vehicle roaring across the spaceport
to the main administration building.</p>

<p>Inside the gleaming crystal building, Connel and
Tom were escorted by a Space Marine guard to the
office of the spaceport commander, Captain Jim Arnold.
He and Connel knew each other well, and after quick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
greetings and the introduction of the young cadet, Connel
asked for the latest reports on the projectile receivers.</p>

<p>"Lou, I've got good news for you," announced Arnold.
"We've completed the receiver ramps for the test. As
soon as your ship is ready to fire her cargo projectiles,
we can receive them."</p>

<p>Connel's face showed the surprise he felt. "Why, Jim,
that's the most amazing news I've ever heard!" he exclaimed.
"How did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Through hard work," replied Arnold, "and the efforts
of a young officer named Slick. He handled the
whole thing."</p>

<p>"Slick!" exclaimed Connel. "I just bawled him out for
wearing a dirty uniform."</p>

<p>"He's responsible for our success," asserted Arnold.
"And what's more, those receivers can be taken apart
and reassembled again in less than ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Incredible," gasped Connel. "I've got to see those
things right away. Come along, Corbett."</p>

<p>Tom followed the major out of the office and back to
the jet car. They were about to drive off to the opposite
end of the field when they heard someone shout to
them. Tom stopped the speedy little car and Connel
turned around to see who had called them.</p>

<p>Carter Devers rushed up and greeted the Solar
Guard officer enthusiastically. "Major, this is a surprise."</p>

<p>"Hello, Carter. What are you doing here?" Connel
asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Had some business here on Mars," said Devers. "I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
finished and I'm on my way back to Earth. You
wouldn't, by any chance, be going back soon, would
you? I saw the Solar Guard cruiser come in and one of
the attendants told me that they were preparing it for
immediate blast-off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, Carter," Connel said briskly. "Get in.
We're just going over to inspect the receivers and then
we'll be heading back."</p>

<p>Devers jumped into the jet car and Tom headed
across the broad expanse of the spaceport.</p>

<p>Connel turned to Devers and said enthusiastically,
"Can you imagine, Devers? Some young officer here at
Marsport has worked out a way to assemble and transport
the receivers in a fantastically small amount of
time."</p>

<p>"That's amazing," said Devers. "I'd like very much to
see them." He looked at Tom and said, "Incidentally,
who is your young friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry," replied Connel. "This is Cadet Corbett
of the <i>Polaris</i> unit. No doubt you've heard of them. He
and his unit mates manage to get into more trouble
than all the monkeys in the Venusian jungle."</p>

<p>Carter laughed. "I've known Lou Connel long
enough to know that when he says something like that
about you, son, he thinks very highly of you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Tom, not knowing what else
to say.</p>

<p>While Connel and Devers talked of the problems surrounding
the projectile operation, Tom concentrated on
his driving. He was following directions given him by
Jim Arnold to reach the testing grounds and this made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
it necessary for Tom to drive right through the center
of the spaceport, weaving in and out of the dozens of
spaceships parked on the concrete ramps.</p>

<p>Tom swept past them, driving expertly, heading
toward a group of concrete blockhouses enclosed by a
fence which he knew would be the testing area. Beside
the fence, a short, stubby-nosed spaceship was loading
cargo, and beneath the vessel, two huge jet trucks were
backing into position. Tom steered the car up to the
gate and stopped at the signal of an armed guard. Connel,
Devers, and Tom stepped out of the car and waited
for a minute, and then young Lieutenant Slick
appeared, wearing a clean uniform.</p>

<p>Slick checked their names off against a list he carried
and then drew Connel to one side. "I'm sorry, sir," he
said, just out of Tom and Dever's hearing, "I can't allow
the cadet inside this area."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Connel. "I'll vouch for him."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," said Slick. "Those are my orders. I
can let you and Mr. Devers in, but not Cadet Corbett."
He showed Connel a list of names: Connel, Strong,
Hemmingwell, Walters, Devers, and Barret. They were
the only names on it.</p>

<p>Connel nodded. "I understand," he said and turned
to Tom. "You'll have to stay here, Corbett," he called.
"Wait for me in the car."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom and hopped back in the jet.</p>

<p>He backed out through the gate, pulling up alongside
the fence near the stubby-nosed freighter. When Connel
and Devers, escorted by Slick, had disappeared
behind a blockhouse inside the restricted area, Tom casually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
walked over to watch the loading operation of the
spaceship. A few of the workers stopped when he
walked up, and recognizing his cadet uniform, greeted
him warmly.</p>

<p>"Space Cadet, eh?" said one of the men. "Sure wish I
could get my boy in the Academy."</p>

<p>"Me too," said another man. "All I hear from morning
until night is Space Academy&mdash;Space Academy."</p>

<p>Tom smiled his appreciation of their admiration.
While he answered their questions about the training
school of the Solar Guard, they continued working. After
a while the conversation turned to the restricted
area behind the fence.</p>

<p>"Some pretty important work going on in there," said
one of the men. "But how come they wouldn't let you
go in?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been cleared by security," replied Tom.
"It's top secret."</p>

<p>"Secret," said a man who had just joined the group.
Tom had noticed him before, climbing out of one of the
huge jet trucks parked near the gate. "Why, there ain't
nothing secret about what's going on in there," he continued.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" asked Tom alertly.</p>

<p>"Why, we all know about it, Cadet," said one of the
first men Tom had spoken to. "They're building receivers
for cargo projectiles."</p>

<p>Tom gulped in surprise. "But how did you know?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Why, it's the only thing we've been talking about
down at the garage and at Sloppy Sam's, the jet-truckers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
hangout," replied the trucker. "If this thing works,
surface transportation will be finished."</p>

<p>"That's right," asserted another worker. "The whole
industry will be wiped out overnight. Nobody will have
anything trucked any more. Cargo'll be loaded into a
projectile and shot off into space to a passing freighter.
Then the freighter carries it to its destination and
shoots it back down to a receiver."</p>

<p>"But how could you know all this?" asked Tom. "It is
one of the Solar Guard's most closely guarded secrets."</p>

<p>"It's all over Mars," declared the truck driver with a
derisive laugh. "Why, everybody knows it."</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the men yelled and pointed toward
the fence. The jet truck parked near the gate was rolling
forward slowly. As Tom and the men watched in
horror, the giant vehicle crashed through the fence and
rolled into the restricted area, picking up speed.</p>

<p>In a flash Tom was inside the jet car, driving right
through the hole in the fence and speeding after the
huge machine. Around him, guards were running after
the truck, shouting frantic warnings. Far ahead of him,
Tom saw Major Connel and Devers standing near several
receivers lined up outside a blockhouse. The truck
was rolling straight toward them. Hearing the shouts
of alarm, the two men turned and saw their danger.
Devers immediately jumped into the safety of the
blockhouse, but Connel stumbled and fell heavily.
Tom's blood ran cold. He saw that the major had struck
his head against one of the receivers and he lay on the
ground, dazed and unable to move.</p>

<p>Tom jammed the accelerator of the tiny jet car to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
floor and shot ahead like a rocket. He was alongside the
truck now, but the distance between the huge machine
and Connel was narrowing rapidly. Tom clenched his
teeth and urged the little car on faster. He knew that
there was not enough time for him to jump into the
truck and pull the brake. There was only one thing he
could do.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Regaining his senses, Connel tried to crawl to safety,
but there was no time. He braced himself for what he
knew would be instant death, and then to his amazement
he saw Tom's jet car swerve sharply in front of the
runaway truck.</p>

<br /><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Moved picture to correspond to text.">Note</ins>
</div>

<p>There was a wrenching crash of metal, a shrill scream
of skidding tires, climaxed by a thunderous roar. After
that, deathly silence.</p>

<p>For a second Connel stood frozen in horror, staring
at the overturned truck and the tangle of twisted metal
that was the jet car. Then he lunged forward with a
frantic cry.</p>

<p>"Corbett! Corbett!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_8" id="CHAPTER_8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>


<p>"Tom! Tom!"</p>

<p>Connel knelt beside the limp form of the Space Cadet,
calling frantically, praying that the boy would be
miraculously unhurt, yet fearing the worst. A few moments
later Tom groaned and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Did I&mdash;did I stop the truck?" he asked weakly.</p>

<p>"You sure did, son!" said Connel, breathing a sigh of
relief. "And thank the lucky spaceman's stars that
you're all right. I don't see how you got out alive."</p>

<p>Tom sat up. "I jumped from the jet car at the last
minute," he said. "I guess I must have bumped my
head." He looked down at his torn uniform. "Wow," he
said. "Look at me."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it." Connel laughed. He turned
to Lieutenant Slick who had just rushed up.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, I want a complete check on the men
who were standing outside the fence when that truck
ran away."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The young lieutenant patted Tom on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
shoulder. "Good work, Cadet," he said and started
away.</p>

<p>Tom grinned his thanks at the young officer and
struggled to his feet. "Sir," he said to Connel, "I think I
should explain something about that truck."</p>

<p>"The truck!" cried Connel. He turned and called,
"Lieutenant, come back here." The young officer turned
back. "Go ahead, Tom," said Connel.</p>

<p>While Tom told his story of the truck having been
parked near the gate, and having started to roll by
itself, Connel and Slick listened intently. Quietly Devers
joined them. Finally, when Tom had finished, Connel
rubbed his chin thoughtfully and stared at the truck
which was being examined by a swarm of guards.</p>

<p>A few moments later the sergeant in command
reported to Connel that they had found a worn clutch
plate that could have slipped and caused the truck to
roll of its own accord, especially if the motor was
turning over.</p>

<p>Connel nodded and then ordered, "Get the driver
over here."</p>

<p>The man that had spoken to Tom about the secret
project came forward under guard. He was thoroughly
frightened and Connel was aware of it. "Relax, friend,"
he said. "I just want to ask you one question."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," gulped the truck driver.</p>

<p>"Was there anything wrong with your truck?" demanded
Connel.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the driver. "I had a slipping
clutch."</p>

<p>Connel turned abruptly to Lieutenant Slick. "All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
right, Slick, release this man and get that fence back up.
I'm satisfied that it was an accident."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Slick, and left the group with the
grateful driver.</p>

<p>Connel relaxed for the first time and turned to Carter
Devers who had been standing by silently. "Well,
Carter," he said, "see what I meant about the <i>Polaris</i> unit
getting into trouble! Blast it, if they don't start it, they
sure can finish it." He turned to Tom. "Son, you deserve
some time off. Go back to the Spacelanes Hotel in Marsport
and get yourself a room. Just forget everything and
relax. And get a new uniform, too."</p>

<p>"And send the bill to me," Devers suddenly spoke up.
"It's the least I can do."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Tom. "I could sure use a little
sleep."</p>

<p>Hitching a ride on a jet sled, Tom rode over to the
administration building where he managed to clean up
enough to make himself presentable at the hotel. Later,
as he rode along the curving canal in a jet cab into the
main section of Marsport, he relaxed for the first time
and enjoyed the sights.</p>

<p>The city of Marsport was built in a hurry&mdash;at least,
the old section of the city was. Like many other planets,
when first colonized by the early great conquerors of
space several hundred years before, the city grew out of
immediate need, with no formalized plan.</p>

<p>Years later, when the Solar Alliance was formed and
there was uniform government all over the solar
system, the citizens of Mars began to regard their ugly
little capital with distaste. A major effort was made to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
clean up its squalid appearance and huge cargoes of Titan
crystal were shipped to Mars for modern construction.
Now, as Tom Corbett rode in comfort along a
speedway bordering one of the ancient canals, he approached
the city with a vague feeling of awe. Gleaming
towers, reflecting the last rays of the setting sun,
loomed just ahead of him, and the wavy lines of heat
rising out of the sandy deserts seemed to make the
buildings dance. It was a sunset ballet that never failed
to thrill even the oldest Martian citizen.</p>

<p>At the magnificent Spacelanes Hotel, Tom was
greeted with the greatest respect. Already his feat of
stopping the runaway truck had been announced over
the stereo newscasts, and when he asked the location of
the nearest supply store to buy a uniform, one was immediately
brought to his room by the manager.</p>

<p>"But how did you know?" asked Tom, astounded.</p>

<p>The manager showed Tom a photograph of himself
in his ragged clothes, taken while he was talking to
Connel. In the background was the remains of the jet
car.</p>

<p>"Major Connel called and said you would be staying
here," said the manager. "From the looks of you in this
picture, we knew you would need a new uniform."</p>

<p>"And you've got my size!" exclaimed Tom, holding
up the gleaming new blouse.</p>

<p>"We called the Academy." The manager smiled. "We
wanted to be sure. Incidentally, there is a message for
you." The manager handed Tom a typed space-o-gram
and left. The cadet ripped it open and smiled as he
read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap lowercase">TRYING TO HOG ALL THE STEREO
SPACE YOU CAN WHILE YOU LEAVE
THE REAL COMPETITION AT HOME,
YOU RAT! CONGRATULATIONS!</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase" style="position: absolute; right: 20%;">ASTRO AND ROGER</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Laughing to himself, Tom left the message on the
desk, stripped off his torn, dirty clothes, and stepped
into a hot, refreshing shower. Half an hour later he was
digging into a thick steak with French fried potatoes.</p>

<p>After a third helping of dessert, the cadet stretched
out on the bed and closed his eyes. But sleep would not
come. The incidents at the spaceport that afternoon
kept flashing through his mind. He tossed restlessly,
something he couldn't quite remember was tugging at
the back of his mind.</p>

<p>He retraced the events of the day, beginning with the
landing of the <i>Polaris</i> and ending with the crash of the
jet truck.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sat up straight. Then quickly he jumped
out of bed, hurriedly threw on the new uniform, and
rammed his feet into the soft space boots.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, having used the service elevator to
avoid the lobby, he stood on the corner of Lowell Lane
and Builker Avenue. He hailed a passing jet cab, and
climbing in, asked the driver, "Do you know a restaurant
or a bar called Sloppy Sam's?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the driver. "That where you want to go?"</p>

<p>"As fast as this wagon will get me there," replied
Tom.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the driver strangely. "You look like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
nice kid. That joint's for&mdash;for&mdash;well, it ain't for a Space
Cadet," he concluded lamely.</p>

<p>"The first thing they teach us at the Academy,
buddy," said Tom impatiently, "is how to take care of
ourselves, and the second thing is to mind our own
business."</p>

<p>"Right," said the driver, tight-lipped. He slammed
the car into motion and the force hurled Tom back in
his seat.</p>

<p>Tom grinned. He hadn't meant to sound so tough. He
leaned over and apologized. "I'm looking for an old
friend. Someone told me he drives a truck and he might
be there."</p>

<p>"Forget it, kid," said the driver. "I wouldn't want you
in my cab if you couldn't take care of yourself. We pay
taxes to teach guys like you how to protect us. A lot of
good it would do if you were scared of a taxi driver."</p>

<p>Tom laughed and settled back in his seat to watch
the city flash past.</p>

<p>A half hour later the curly-haired cadet became
aware of the change from the magnificent crystal buildings
to the dirty and streaked buildings of the poorer
section of the city. And with the change, Tom noticed a
difference in the people who walked the streets. Here
were men who wore their coat collars high and their
caps pulled low, and who would duck into the shadows
at the approach of the cab and then watch it with dark,
silent eyes.</p>

<p>"Here ya are, Cadet," the driver announced, stopping
in front of a small, dirty building. "Sloppy Sam's."</p>

<p>Tom looked out. The door was open and he could see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
inside. Sawdust covered the floor, and the tables and
chairs were old and rickety. The men inside were the
same as those he had seen on the street, tough-looking,
hard, steely-eyed. Tom looked at the faded sign over
the door. "That says <i>Bad</i> Sam's," he protested.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">

<span class="caption">The men inside were tough-looking and steely-eyed</span><br />
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Picture originally on page 89; moved to correspond to text.">Note</ins></div>

<p>"Used to be called Bad Sam's," replied the driver. "As
a matter of fact, I think it's still officially Bad Sam's.
You see, Sam used to be a real tough fella. Then one
day a fella came along that was tougher than he was
and beat the exhaust out of him. Sam went to pot after
that. He got fat and lazy, and his place here got dirtier
and dirtier. Finally everybody started calling him
Sloppy Sam and it stuck."</p>

<p>"Quite a story." Tom laughed. "What happened to
the fellow that took Sam over the hurdles?"</p>

<p>"He's got a joint on the other side of town called Bad
Richard's. But they're friends now. Get along fine."</p>

<p>Tom paid the driver and stood on the sidewalk,
watching the silver cab shoot away into the darkness.
Then he took a deep breath and slowly moved toward
the open door of Sloppy Sam's.</p>

<p>Inside, Tom saw that most of the customers were
lined up at the bar, drinking rocket juice, a dark foul-tasting
liquid that Tom had sipped once and vowed he
would never try again. But as he looked around, he
didn't think it was the type of place you could order
anything milder, so he walked up to the bar and
ordered loudly, "A bucket of juice."</p>

<p>Some of the men at the bar turned away from the
stereo screen to look at the newcomer. They eyed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
crisp, clean uniform narrowly, and then turned silently
back to the play on the screen.</p>

<p>The husky bartender placed the small glass of dark
liquid in front of Tom. "Twenty credits," he announced
in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"Twenty!" exclaimed Tom. "Don't give me that
rocket wash! It's five credits a shot."</p>

<p>"To a Space Cadet that wants to keep his reputation,
Corbett," replied the burly man, "it's twenty."</p>

<p>Tom realized that the man had seen his picture on
the stereo news that afternoon and that it would be impossible
to get out of paying this blatant form of blackmail.
He handed over the money and picked up the
glass. He sipped it to keep up appearances but even the
few drops he allowed to trickle down his throat almost
made him gag. He gasped for breath. Whatever information
he might be able to get here, it wasn't worth another
swallow of that stuff.</p>

<p>He stood at the bar for nearly half an hour, watching
the stereo and waiting. When the show was over, the
men turned back to the serious business of drinking.
Two of them drifted over close to Tom and looked him
up and down. After a whispered conversation, they
turned to him and pointed to his drink, the same one he
had bought and had not touched since.</p>

<p>"Drink up, mate," said the nearest man, a tall, heavy-shouldered
man with a dark beard, "then join us in another
one."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said Tom. "One's my limit."</p>

<p>The two men laughed. "Well, I'll say this for you, lad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
you're honest about it," said the tall one. "Most squirts
coming in here try to put on they can take the stuff and
then they wind up in the gutter."</p>

<p>"That's right, Cag!" said the other man, laughing.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in here, Cadet?" asked the man
called Cag.</p>

<p>"Looking for a guy."</p>

<p>"What's his name? Maybe we know him."</p>

<p>"Yeah, we might," chimed in the other. "We know
just about everybody that comes in here."</p>

<p>"Maybe he don't want to tell us, Monty," said Cag.</p>

<p>"I don't know his name," said Tom. "I just met him
today and he mentioned this place. I wanted to talk to
him about something."</p>

<p>"Where did you see him?"</p>

<p>Tom paused. It was only a chance remark that the
driver of the jet truck had made and it was a slim
chance that these two men might know him. He
decided to risk it. "He's a jet trucker. I saw him out at the
spaceport today."</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other. "Little guy, with
a sort of funny twitch in his eye?" asked Cag.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tom. "That's him. Know him?"</p>

<p>"He hangs out in a joint across the street," said
Monty. "Come on outside. I'll show you where it is. And
his name's Pistol, in case you want to know."</p>

<p>"Pistol," said Tom. "That's an odd name."</p>

<p>"Not when you consider he carries a pistol all the
time," snorted Cag.</p>

<p>Tom and the two men walked to the door and out
into the street.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want to see him about, anyway?" asked
Monty, as they walked to the corner.</p>

<p>"Just wanted to talk to him about the jet-trucking
business."</p>

<p>"What about it? We're truckers, me and Cag, we
could probably tell you a lot more than Pistol."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Tom. "But I want to talk to Pistol."</p>

<p>They stopped at the corner and Monty stepped off
the curb into the street. "See that light down there," he
said, pointing down the block, "the one just above the
door?"</p>

<p>Tom turned to look. "Where&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He suddenly felt a sharp jolting pain in the back of
his head and then everything went black.</p>

<p>"Nice work, Cag," commented Monty.</p>

<p>"What'll we do with him?" asked Cag.</p>

<p>"Throw him in the back of the truck and get outta
here," said Monty, pulling Tom's limp form into the
shadows of an alley. "I'll get in touch with the boss and
tell him what's happened. And you better send out
word to get Pistol. He must know something."</p>

<p>"Right," said Cag. "Gee, Corbett's getting his nice
clean uniform messed up."</p>

<p>Dirty gutter water flowed over Tom in the dark
Martian alley as the boy lay deathly still.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_9" id="CHAPTER_9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>


<p>"What!" exclaimed Major Connel. "Give me that again."</p>

<p>The messenger from the Solar Guard headquarters
on Mars repeated the message. "Cadet Corbett has not
been in his hotel since last night, sir," he said. "He was
seen leaving the service entrance at about 2100 hours.
There is no report as to his whereabouts, sir."</p>

<p>Standing at the foot of the ladder leading to the main
air lock of the <i>Polaris</i>, Major Connel turned to Carter
Devers angrily.</p>

<p>"This is the end!" he shouted. "I've had as much of
this foolishness as I'm going to take. When that young
space brat comes back, I'm going to throw the book at
him."</p>

<p>"Now, now, Major," said Devers. "I wouldn't be too
hard on the lad. How do you know that he isn't in some
kind of trouble?"</p>

<p>"That's just it," growled Connel. "One of those three
is always in trouble."</p>

<p>"He saved your life," reminded Devers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm well aware of that," replied Connel stiffly. "But
it's a personal debt. It has nothing to do with his behavior
as a cadet. I ordered him to go to that hotel and rest,
not go skylarking all over Marsport. This is typical of
the whole unit's attitude."</p>

<p>"But you said that they were the best crew you ever
had," insisted Devers.</p>

<p>"I know, but what's worse is that <i>they</i> know it! Blast
it, Carter, it isn't easy to say the things I've said about
Corbett! He's a fine lad. But look at it this way. I have
to return to Atom City immediately. Corbett may be in
trouble, right?" Devers nodded. "Well, how do you
think I feel, blasting off and leaving him?"</p>

<p>Devers nodded his understanding as Connel continued
furiously, "And furthermore, I have more important
things to think about than wet-nursing a cadet."</p>

<p>At that moment Connel noticed a jet car racing
across the spaceport toward the <i>Polaris</i>. As it drew near,
he saw the insigne of the Solar Guard on the hood. His
eyes widened hopefully for a second. "Humph," he
grunted, "this may be him now!"</p>

<p>"If it is," cautioned Devers, "go easy on the boy."</p>

<p>"We'll see, we'll see."</p>

<p>The car screamed to a stop in front of them, the
plastic blister was thrown back, and another Solar Guard
messenger climbed out, saluting Connel smartly.</p>

<p>"Message from Solar Guard headquarters, Major
Connel," he said.</p>

<p>Connel took the paper and ripped it open. "Excuse
me, Carter," he muttered and stepped to one side to
read the note hurriedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="smcap lowercase">HEMMINGWELL'S CHIEF FOREMAN
ARRESTED AS SABOTEUR. ADVISE YOU
RETURN IMMEDIATELY. WALTERS</p></div>

<p>Dashing up the metal ladder, Connel roared the order
to the waiting ground crew. "Stand by to blast off."</p>

<p>Carter Devers scrambled up into the giant ship after
the Solar Guard officer, and in less than a minute later,
all ports were sealed and the <i>Polaris</i> was ready for
space. In the pilot's chair, Connel called traffic control
for blast-off, and at the same time prepared to raise
ship.</p>

<p>By the time Devers had strapped himself into the copilot's
chair next to Connel, the ship was quivering with
leashed power. Suddenly Connel roared the familiar
call for space.</p>

<p>"Blast off, minus five, four, three, two, one, <i>zero</i>!"</p>

<p>The great ship literally exploded off the ground, and
within seconds, was rocketing through the thin atmosphere
above Mars on course for Earth, far across the
deep black velvet void of space, but leaving Tom
Corbett, her true commander, behind.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Captain Steve Strong and Commander Walters
watched grimly as the <i>Polaris</i> landed on the Academy
spaceport. They had been in contact with Connel during
his trip back to Earth and had already told the bluff
major of still another incident that had taken place at
the Academy while he was gone.</p>

<p>Roger and Astro had stolen a rocket scout and
disappeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't get it, sir," sighed Strong. "Manning and
Astro blowing wide open, Corbett disappearing&mdash;" He
shook his head. "It doesn't make sense."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Walters. "But those three are
really in trouble now. Connel won't stand for this kind of
behavior."</p>

<p>"Do you think that he'll go so far as to ask for a
court-martial?"</p>

<p>Walters hesitated. "I hate to say this, Steve," he said
finally, "but if Major Connel doesn't, I will be forced to.
No other unit has had more of an opportunity to prove
itself than the <i>Polaris</i> unit. And every time, something
like this happens."</p>

<p>"But suppose they have good explanations," insisted
Strong.</p>

<p>"It would have to be better than anything they've
had before," replied Walters. "Frankly, I cannot see
how that is possible."</p>

<p>Walters climbed into his jet car and Strong followed,
biting his lip.</p>

<p>The car shot across the field to the now grounded
<i>Polaris</i>, pulling alongside it just as Major Connel and
Carter Devers climbed out of the open hatch. Without even
the courtesy of a greeting, Connel roared, "What's this
about those two cadets stealing a ship?"</p>

<p>"Let's talk about that later, Lou," said Walters.
"Climb in. We've got something more important to
discuss. The saboteur."</p>

<p>Devers stepped forward. "This is no place for me, I
know," he said. "<ins  class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'I&quot;ll'.">I'll</ins> leave you here. And thanks for the
lift, Major."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Connel grunted his acknowledgment and climbed
into the car as Strong turned to Devers.</p>

<p>"There was a message for you, Mr. Devers," said the
Solar Guard captain. "You're to get in touch with your
Atom City office immediately."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Steve," said Devers, and with a wave of his
hand to the others walked away.</p>

<p>As the jet car raced back to the Tower of Galileo,
Walters brought Connel up to date on the incident at
the hangar leading to the arrest of Pat Troy. When they
reached Walters' office, high in the tower, Troy was
ushered in by two guards.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" barked Connel, taking command of the
situation.</p>

<p>Troy walked to the center of the room and sat down
in the indicated chair, facing Walters, Connel, and
Strong.</p>

<p>"We'd like to get to the bottom of this as soon as
possible, Troy," began Connel. "So I suggest that you tell
us the truth and save us the trouble of pulling it out of
you.</p>

<p>"I will answer all of your questions to the best of my
ability, sir," said Troy calmly. "And I will tell the truth
at all times."</p>

<p>"Very well," snorted Connel. "Now, who are you
working for?"</p>

<p>"Professor Hemmingwell," replied Troy.</p>

<p>"Stow that," snarled Connel. "Who paid you to
sabotage the ship?"</p>

<p>"I have not committed any sabotage for anyone, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you deny that you wrecked that firing unit?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Walters suddenly leaned forward. "But you do not
deny that you knew about the special unit that
Professor Hemmingwell had created," he said. "A unit that
only he and I knew about?"</p>

<p>"I knew about the unit&mdash;yes, sir," replied Troy.</p>

<p>"How could you?" demanded Walters.</p>

<p>"I overheard you both discussing it one day."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the hangar," said Troy. "You and Professor
Hemmingwell were talking on the main deck while I was
inside&mdash;what will be the radar deck&mdash;working. I heard
you talking about the unit, and after you left, I
happened to find a blueprint on the table. It coincided with
what you had been talking about. I looked at it and
then thought nothing of it. A few minutes later the
professor came running in and took the blueprint away."</p>

<p>"Did he ask you if you had read the print?" asked
Connel.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Troy. "If he had, I would have told
him that I had."</p>

<p>"Now," said Connel, "did you have anything to do
with the so-called accident to the oscillating timing
device?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you know who did?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"We can put you under drugs, you know, and get the
truth out of you," warned Connel.</p>

<p>"You'll get the same answer, sir," Troy calmly replied.</p>

<p>Walters, Strong, and Connel moved to one side of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
room and talked in low tones while Troy remained
seated.</p>

<p>"Well," said Walters, "do we give him drugs or not?"</p>

<p>"I may be sticking my neck out, Commander," said
Steve, "but I think that he's telling the truth."</p>

<p>"Same here," said Connel. "I would suggest that we
let him loose, and even let him go back to work, but
keep an eye on him."</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't give him drugs now?"</p>

<p>"No. I'd give the benefit of the doubt to a man any
time," said the hardened space major.</p>

<p>"All right," said Walters. He turned back and told
Troy he was free, but that he was not to leave the
restricted area. And he was only permitted to work on
less critical projects. "Do you have anything to say?"
Walters asked.</p>

<p>Troy smiled at them and shook his head. "No, sir.
That's fine with me," he said. "And I'll keep my eye
open for the real saboteur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That won't be necessary!" snapped Connel. "We're
capable of handling our own detective work."</p>

<p>Troy grinned again. "Very well, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Connel dismissed the guards and the foreman walked
out of the office a free man.</p>

<p>Connel and Walters turned to discussing the installation
of the receivers on Mars, with Connel lauding
young Lieutenant Slick highly. "That boy deserves a
promotion in rank," he stated.</p>

<p>Walters nodded. "I'll put his name on the list at the
end of the year," he said. "If he has done everything
you say he has, he deserves it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve Strong stood to one side, waiting impatiently
for the two older men to finish their conversation before
asking about Tom Corbett. At the same time, he was a
little fearful of bringing up the subject of the <i>Polaris</i>
unit, in the face of what Astro and Roger had just done.
It was not an easy thing to do, but at the first opportunity
he broke into the conversation with a direct question
to Connel.</p>

<p>"Major, is there any doubt in your mind about Corbett's
disappearance being an accident or do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Connel cut him off. "Do I think he's AWOL?"</p>

<p>Strong nodded silently.</p>

<p>"Steve," said Connel patiently, "I know how you feel
about those three boys, but tell me, how long can this
go on? They constantly take off on their own, without
authorization&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they usually have a good reason," Strong interrupted
quickly.</p>

<p>"Then why don't they give us the reason first?" Connel
shot back.</p>

<p>"What Lou is trying to say," interjected Walters
quietly, "is that Corbett, Manning, and Astro have time
and time again committed us to take action, to get them
out of situations that they initiated. It's time they were
stopped! They are only one unit in this Academy, not
the whole works."</p>

<p>"Then I guess you mean"&mdash;Strong hesitated, a lump
in his throat&mdash;"it will be the end of the unit when they
get back?"</p>

<p>"If they get back," snapped Connel, "I intend to see
that all three receive solid disciplinary action."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, Major," said Strong. He rose and addressed
the commander. "I request permission for
emergency leave, sir, commencing now."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-112.png" width="500" height="419" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Permission denied!" said Walters. "This is exactly
what I've been talking about, Steve. You want to leave
to go to Mars and look for Tom when we need you here
on the project."</p>

<p>Strong's face suddenly turned white. And then, for
the first time in his career, he ignored military courtesy
and turned to leave without the courtesy of a salute or
permission to do so. Connel almost called him back, but
Commander Walters put a restraining hand on the
major's arm.</p>

<p>"Think of it this way, Lou," he said. "If you wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
something you believed to be right, and it was denied
you, how would you feel?"</p>

<p>"I'd very likely do the same thing," snapped the
major. "And I'd get my rockets busted for it by my
commanding officer!"</p>

<p>Walters grinned and pulled the major back to the
desk where they continued their discussion of the
receivers on Mars.</p>

<p>They had no sooner begun their discussion when the
sliding door opened and Professor Hemmingwell burst
into the room, his smock flying behind him, his hair
ruffled and eyes wide with fright.</p>

<p>"The ship! The ship!" he cried out. "Someone has
blown up the whole control panel of the ship!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-027.png" width="500" height="156" alt="" title="" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_10" id="CHAPTER_10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>


<p>"It will take weeks to repair it!"</p>

<p>Professor Hemmingwell stood on the main deck of
the giant spaceship staring sadly at the mess of wires
and tubes, controls and gauges, switches and filaments,
all shattered and useless.</p>

<p>"When did it happen?" demanded Connel.</p>

<p>"Less than half an hour ago," replied Dave Barret.
"Professor Hemmingwell and I were down at the far
end of the hangar. The men had just left for the day
and we were planning the work for tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Then what happened?" demanded Connel. "Wait,
don't answer yet!" He stopped himself and turned to a
Space Marine standing nearby. "You! Can you work an
audio recorder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the Marine.</p>

<p>"Then get a machine up here on the double and take
down everything that's said."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the Marine and left the ship. Connel
silently began inspecting the wreckage. It was ten times
as serious as the first sabotage attempt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Barret, Commander Walters, Professor Hemmingwell,
and Captain Strong watched the major, their teeth
clenched, eyes clouded with anger. Where the destruction
of the first unit could have been called an accident,
here was tangible evidence of a deliberate attempt to
stop the whole project. The Space Marine, accompanied
by Firehouse Tim Rush, returned five minutes later
with the audio recorder and set it up for operation.</p>

<p>Connel took the small needlelike microphone in his
hand and spoke into it as the reel of sound tape
unwound slowly.</p>

<p>"This is a preliminary inquiry into the sabotage of the
control deck of spaceship XX, Operation Space Projectile,"
he said. "This is Major Lou Connel, interrogator!"
He paused and nodded to Barret who stepped forward.
"My first witness will be Dave Barret." Holding the
microphone close to the young engineer's mouth, Connel
said, "Tell us everything you know of this incident."</p>

<p>Barret spoke slowly and carefully, describing how he
and Professor Hemmingwell had been at the other end
of the hangar when the explosion had occurred.
Professor Hemmingwell had immediately run out of the
hangar to inform Commander Walters, leaving Barret
alone to check the damage. "Then you and Commander
Walters and the Space Marines showed up, sir," he
concluded. "That's all I know."</p>

<p>"All right," said Connel and turned to the professor.
"Your statement, Professor Hemmingwell."</p>

<p>"It happened just about the way Dave said,"
Hemmingwell began. "Except for one thing. I cannot see
why there weren't any guards at their posts this afternoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
We were without any men at the entrances for
nearly an hour. Anyone could have slipped into the
hangar and planted the bomb."</p>

<p>"Why weren't the entrances guarded?" snapped
Connel, looking directly at Firehouse Tim Rush.</p>

<p>"Cadets Manning and Astro left their posts without
leave, sir," reported the stocky little spaceman.</p>

<p>Captain Strong took an involuntary step forward, his
face drained of all color. Connel looked at him,
steely-eyed. "Did you hear that, Strong?" he growled.</p>

<p>Strong nodded. "I&mdash;I did," he stammered.</p>

<p>"So those two idiots not only stole a rocket scout, but
they left their posts."</p>

<p>Strong could only shake his head in utter disbelief.
Commander Walters looked at him pityingly.</p>

<p>"I knew they had taken the scout," said Walters, his
voice hard and tight. "But I didn't think they were
foolish enough to leave their posts."</p>

<p>"Well, they did, sir," declared Rush. "They left about
four hours before they were to be relieved. I was
making the rounds when I discovered that they were gone.
I put two other men on guard right away, but the doors
were unguarded for at least an hour. Anyone could
have walked in without the slightest trouble."</p>

<p>Connel turned back to Walters. "This is the end!
Those two cadets are going up before a general
court-martial."</p>

<p>"Commander," protested Strong, "you can't&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Steve!" barked Connel. "There's a limit to
how long you can defend your unit. Face it, man, those
three boys have gone off their rockers. They're too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
cocky. This is the last straw." He turned away from the
young Solar Guard officer and faced the others. "Let's
get on with the interrogation. Firehouse! What have
you got to say about this?"</p>

<p>The tough little enlisted guard stepped up and
reported clearly and rapidly and without pause. When he
was finished, Connel turned to the guards that had
replaced Roger and Astro and each one repeated the story
told by Firehouse Tim.</p>

<p>Over and over, Connel heard the same story. No one
seemed to have been around the ship when the explosion
took place. And it seemed that the only time when
a saboteur could have gotten into the hangar and
planted the bomb was during the hour the doors were
unguarded.</p>

<p>Finally, the interrogation was over and Connel declared,
"One thing to remember when you are dealing
with sabotage is this: if the saboteur fails, he might return.
If our enemy does not know the extent of the
damage, then he might return and make another
attempt. So, not a word about this to anyone. And that
includes your mothers."</p>

<p>"Major, there is one thing I'd like to add," said Barret,
stepping forward.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"It's about the cadets," said Barret. "I talked to them
just before they blasted off in the scout. They had a lot
to say about your taking Corbett with you on the trip to
Mars. They seemed disgruntled and dissatisfied."</p>

<p>Steve Strong whirled on the young engineer. "What
did they say?" he demanded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Simply that they didn't feel that they were getting a
fair deal with Tom being taken off guard duty, since he
was actually responsible for them having it in the first
place.</p>

<p>"They said that!" exclaimed Strong. "But how could
that&mdash;" He suddenly closed his mouth and turned
away, frowning.</p>

<p>"But how could what, Steve?" asked Walters.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," said Strong. "You have already
reprimanded me too often as it is for speaking up in their
behalf."</p>

<p>Walters lifted his eyebrows. "It appears to me that
you're getting a little touchy!" he barked. "Watch yourself,
Steve. Don't let your feelings for those boys get out
of hand."</p>

<p>"Blast it!" exclaimed Professor Hemmingwell. "While
you continue talking about those stupid cadets, you're
just wasting my time. There's plenty of work to do and
precious little time to do it in." He turned to Barret.
"Come on, Dave, let's get this mess cleared away."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Dave Barret.</p>

<p>As Hemmingwell and Barret turned their attention to
the wrecked control panel, Connel, Walters, and Strong
climbed out of the ship and left the hangar. On the
slidewalk, headed back to the Academy, Commander
Walters looked at Connel inquiringly.</p>

<p>"What now, Lou?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have an idea, Commander," said Connel. "I'm going
to spend the rest of the night listening to this audiotape
over again. Then I'm going to do a little digging
around."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said Walters. "And I suppose you'll want
to talk to Manning and Astro when they get back."</p>

<p>Connel looked at Captain Strong grimly. "I want to
talk to them so badly, I would crawl on my hands and
knees to get to them right now."</p>

<p>Strong flushed angrily but said nothing, and as soon
as the three officers arrived at the Academy grounds, he
excused himself. He walked slowly and thoughtfully
along, looking at the dormitories with unseeing eyes
and hearing with deaf ears the noise of the cadets getting
ready for bed. He could not believe that Roger or
Astro had abandoned their posts, or that Tom would
run off to disappear on Mars, just for the sake of
disappearing. In all his years at the Academy, Strong had
never met three boys who so exemplified the true spirit
of Space Cadets. Something was wrong somewhere.
But what?</p>

<p>Strong paused outside the huge recreation hall,
watching the cadets. Tony Richards and the <i>Capella</i>
unit walked by, and returning their salutes, Strong
could only see Tom, Roger, and Astro.</p>

<p>A figure dressed in the black-and-gold uniform of an
officer in the Solar Guard walked toward him. Strong's
eyes lighted up with recognition.</p>

<p>"Joan!" he exclaimed. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Looking for you," she said. She had some papers in
her hand and held them out to him.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he asked, glancing at them in the light
reflected from the hall, and then back to the serious
face of the brilliant young physicist, Dr. Joan Dale,
who, in spite of being a woman, had been placed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
charge of the Academy laboratories, the largest and
most complete in the entire Solar Alliance.</p>

<p>"Steve," she began, "I was in charge of the psychograph
tests taken of all the workers at the projectile
operation after the first mishap&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did you know about the second?" Strong
interrupted quickly, remembering Connel's admonition
about keeping the incident quiet.</p>

<p>"I was ordered to go over the graphs again, to look
for any possible clue in a worker's mental make-up that
would lead him to a criminal act." She paused and
looked up at him squarely. "Do you suspect me too?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Joan," said the young captain. "But this
whole business is getting me down. Tom, disappearing
on Mars, Roger and Astro walking off guard duty and
stealing a scout, and now this latest sabotage attempt."
He sighed and shook his head. "I'm tired I guess."</p>

<p>She smiled. "I understand, Steve, and regardless of
what Major Connel and Commander Walters have said,
I'll bet my last credit there's a good reason for what the
boys have done."</p>

<p>Strong looked down at the pretty physicist and
smiled. "Thanks, Joan," he said. "Now, what about
these papers?"</p>

<p>"It's about the report on Pat Troy," she replied.
"When we asked him if he was working with anyone
other than the professor, he lied."</p>

<p>She produced a sheet of paper from among those she
held and handed it to Strong. The young captain took it
and scanned it quickly. The paper was ordinary graph
paper with a series of small, wavy lines on it in red ink.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Near the bottom of the paper, there was a jagged peak
in the wavy line. "What does this mean?" he asked,
pointing to the peak.</p>

<p>"That was his reaction when he was asked if he
worked for anyone else."</p>

<p>"Does that mean it's a lie?"</p>

<p>"Yes. All the waves that you see," she continued,
pointing to the line, "represent answers to questions
about his personal life. Does he shave in the morning?
Does he brush his teeth at night, and so forth. They're
comparison questions to show his reaction when he tells
the truth. That peak indicates a lie."</p>

<p>"Then," said Strong thoughtfully, "he might be the
saboteur."</p>

<p>"Or know who it is," said Joan.</p>

<p>"I've got to get this information to Connel right
away!" said Strong. "Can I have this paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I made copies. I was just going to take one to
the commander when I saw you."</p>

<p>"I'll try to locate Major Connel and you go on and tell
the commander what you've found. And Joan&mdash;" Strong
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Put in a good word for the cadets, will you?" Strong
pleaded. "Both Connel and Commander Walters are all
set to blast them right out of the service."</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can&mdash;" Suddenly Dr. Dale stopped,
her eyes widening with fright. She pointed down the
walk behind Strong.</p>

<p>Steve turned around and gasped. Connel was striding
toward them grimly, followed by four guards carrying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a stretcher covered by a blanket. Strong quickly recognized
the outline of a human form beneath the blanket.</p>

<p>"Major," exclaimed Steve, "what&mdash;who&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It's getting thicker by the hour, Steve!" said Connel
in a low voice. "This is the first time in the history of the
Academy that there has been what looks like"&mdash;he
paused and turned to look at the draped body being
carried past them&mdash;<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original does not have the opening quote.">"an</ins> attempt at murder," he finished.</p>

<p>"Murder!" said Strong. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" demanded Joan.</p>

<p>"A little man who can tell us a great deal if and when
he regains consciousness! Pat Troy!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_11" id="CHAPTER_11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>


<p>"Vroom-m-m!"</p>

<p>As the shattering blast of noise pounded against his
eardrums, Tom Corbett opened his eyes, blinked, and
stared around him. By the dim light from a small window
in the wall over his head, he saw that he was in
some sort of metal enclosure. Suddenly the floor
trembled and again the shocking, shattering noises rang
through his aching head. He tried to sit up but found
that his hands were tied behind his back. The ropes
were so tight, his hands were almost completely numb.
Slowly he clenched his fingers, then opened them again,
repeating the process over and over again while needlelike
pains shot through his hands. Finally there was
feeling in his fingers again and he struggled to a
sitting position.</p>

<p>Again the metal enclosure vibrated and there was another
thunderous blast. This time Tom recognized the
sound.</p>

<p>"A jet!" exclaimed the cadet aloud. "I'm in the van of
a jet truck."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>When Tom tried to stand up, he found that his feet
were bound. Again he went through the slow, painful
process of restoring circulation in his legs and feet, gritting
his teeth against the needles of pain. Finally he
felt strong enough to push his back against the wall and
inch his way upright.</p>

<p>The noise around him continued. Again and again,
he could hear the shattering explosions of the exhausts
and the screaming whine of the jets. Looking around
carefully for the first time, he saw that the van was
empty except for a pile of heavy quilted rugs in one corner
which he knew were used to protect and cushion
cargo.</p>

<p>Hopping to the corner, he flopped down on the
blankets and, one by one, he began dragging them out.
There was nothing else in the van that would aid him in
cutting the thick ropes around his wrists and he hoped
to find something under the heap.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt something hard and boxlike under
the last blanket and he tore it off quickly.</p>

<p>He nearly screamed for joy when he recognized a
heavy metal toolbox. Sitting on the floor of the van, he
maneuvered the top open, then spun around and hopefully
looked inside. There was nothing in the box but a
dirty cloth, and Tom slumped back in bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cadet became aware of the intense heat
inside the van. He was sweating, and he found it difficult
to breath. He inched over to the side of the huge
truck and touched the metal paneling. It was blisteringly
hot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"The New Sahara," he thought, a vision of the desolate
sun-baked wasteland of the Martian desert flashing
through his mind.</p>

<p>He looked around again desperately. The only thing
in the van that might cut through the rope was the edge
of the toolbox. He inched his way back to the box and
began rubbing the rope across the edge of the box, but
it was too smooth.</p>

<p>Tom knew that he would have to roughen the edge
of the box, so that it would cut the thick fibers of the
rope, and in sudden inspiration, he inspected the floor
of the van. The heavy-gauge metal was scarred and
roughened from the many heavy loads dragged across
it. He turned the box over, and with great difficulty,
rubbed it back and forth across the floor. Every few
minutes he tested the edge of the box with his finger.
It was losing its slick surface, but there was a long way
to go.</p>

<p>It got hotter inside the van and Tom's uniform was
soaked with sweat. He found it difficult to breathe and
the continuous roar of the jets tortured his ears.</p>

<p>He did not know how long he had worked, but eventually,
he felt that the edge of the box was sufficiently
rough to try to cut the ropes. He righted the box, placed
the ropes on the edge again and, with a silent prayer,
began scraping them across the metal.</p>

<p>After a few minutes there was a tug at the bonds. The
cadet pushed harder. There was another tug and the
rope seemed to give a little. Working frantically, he
sawed back and forth. The sweat poured from his forehead,
his arms and back ached unbearably, and soon he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
felt something warm and wet begin to trickle down the
palms of his hands. He knew it was blood, but he kept
on grimly, and suddenly he was rewarded. With a snap,
the ropes parted. His hands were free!</p>

<p>Tom hastily untied his feet, and giving the toolbox an
affectionate pat, rose to his feet to begin the next step
in his plan to escape.</p>

<p>The young cadet examined the entire surface of the
inside paneling of the van with his finger tips. He could
find no opening other than the back door, which he
knew was locked by an electronic beam. Without the
proper light-key adjustment, the door could not be
opened. And the vent high in the wall was much too
small to help him.</p>

<p>He sat down, disheartened. He was still no better off
than before. And there was no way of telling where he
was, whether it was day or night, and how long he had
been riding in the jet truck.</p>

<p>He rested on the floor of the van, the bumpy ride
cushioned by the soft blankets, and tried to recall the
events that had led him into this trap. He remembered
the two men, Cag and Monty, and grimly vowed to repay
them if he ever met them again.</p>

<p>Suddenly remembering something more immediate,
Tom sat bolt upright. He got up and went to the front
of the huge van. There he knelt down in one corner and
felt the floor with his hands. He found exactly what he
had been hoping for. A large grate, and it was cool! He
jumped up, grinning, grabbed the heavy toolbox and
carried it back to the corner where he let it drop on the
grate. It sagged slightly, near the corner. He picked up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the box and dropped it again. The grate sagged a little
more. Tom got down on his knees and felt along the
edge of the floor. The grate was giving way.</p>

<p>He really began to hammer in earnest then. And each
time the heavy box thudded on the grate, he thanked
his lucky stars that he had lived near a garage when he
was a boy back in New Chicago. Time and time again,
he had slipped inside the huge vans after the produce
had been taken out, to find a piece of fruit. He had gotten
into the sealed vans, through the refrigerating compartment,
a huge unit beneath the van and connected
to the cab. Opening the outside hatch to the unit, he
had squeezed inside and then unscrewed the grate from
the bottom.</p>

<p>With a final hard smash, the grate gave way, clattering
into the recesses of the refrigerating unit. Now Tom
was grateful for the roar of the jets. It covered the
sound of his escape.</p>

<p>Quickly reaching down into the unit, Tom began
tearing the mechanism apart; ripping out coils of copper
tubing and rubber connections. Disconnecting a
pipe, he used it to pry apart the rest of the unit, and finally,
after removing the broken parts, there was room
enough for his body.</p>

<p>Stuffing the heavy pipe in his tunic, Tom dropped
into the unit and opened the outside hatch. A blast of
cool air struck him. The sun was setting and the cadet
knew that soon the near-zero temperatures of night
would settle over the desert. Tom poked his head out
and the air stream hit him like a solid wall. He looked
back past the spinning wheels and saw a long stretch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
deserted road bordering a canal. His view forward was
blocked by the overhanging cab of the truck. The small
step up to the cab was a foot away. Tom eased back
into the compartment again and sat back against the
wall to consider his next move. He would have a better
chance of not being seen if he waited for darkness. On
the other hand, they might reach their destination
before that and he would be caught. Tom made up his
mind quickly.</p>

<p>Moving back to the hatch, he eased himself through
the opening. There was a ticklish moment when he had
to let go of the side of the compartment and swing over
on the step. He took a deep breath and lurched forward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-128.png" width="500" height="411" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Behind him, the huge thick wheels spun over the
road. A slip now would mean instant, crushing death.
His fingers reached for and grasped the door handle.
Seconds later, he stood balanced on the step, swaying
in the wind.</p>

<p>He dared a glance into the window of the cab,
wondering why he had not been noticed before. He saw
Cag and Monty inside, Cag driving and Monty asleep.
The driver was on the opposite side from Tom, and
Monty was slumped against the door.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-129.png" width="500" height="412" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Tom realized that if he opened the door, Monty
would fall out and probably be killed, but he had no
choice. He reached up for the handle and tested it gently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
before swinging down on it to make sure it would
open. It gave a little. Then bracing himself, he pulled
hard.</p>

<p>The door swung open and Monty fell out, hitting the
pavement and rolling off into the sand to lie still. Tom
paid no attention to him. With a mighty effort, he
swung into the cab and confronted a startled, wild-eyed
Cag.</p>

<p>"You!" cried Cag.</p>

<p>"Stop this crate, or so help me, I'll break your head!"
Tom shouted, brandishing the short length of pipe.</p>

<p>In reply, Cag suddenly swerved the big truck to one
side of the road, hoping to throw Tom out of the open
door. Tom managed to grab hold just in time. He swung
back into the cab and struck out with the pipe.</p>

<p>Cag ducked and swung the heavy truck to the opposite
side of the road, trying to throw Tom off balance,
but the cadet was not to be denied. He swung the
heavy pipe again and again, landing hard, telling blows
on the arms and shoulders of the burly truck driver. Finally
a solid blow caught Cag on the side of the head
and he slumped over unconscious. Tom leaned over
him, grabbed the wheel, and maneuvered the big truck
back onto a straightaway course. A minute later he
brought the truck to a stop.</p>

<p>Tom jumped out and pulled Cag after him, taking a
bottle of water from the small compartment behind the
driver's seat. He splashed some on the man's face, and
while Cag moaned and came to, Tom drank his fill. He
hadn't realized that he was so thirsty.</p>

<p>"Cag," said Tom coldly, when he knew the man could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
understand him, "I'll beat your ears off if you don't tell
me who put you up to this!"</p>

<p>Cag was silent. Tom stepped in and slapped the man
across the face.</p>

<p>"Come on! Talk!" he snarled.</p>

<p>Dirty, his clothes ripped, his hands bloody, Cadet
Tom Corbett did not look like the carefree young cadet
that Cag had met a few hours ago. He was frightened
and began to whine.</p>

<p>"Talk or I'll slap you silly!" Tom growled.</p>

<p>Cag saw the wild rage in Tom's eyes and began to
stutter.</p>

<p>"The trucking outfit! Just find out who owns this
trucking outfit and who would gain if the projectiles
failed."</p>

<p>Tom was back in the cab in a flash. He started the
mighty jets and began to engage the clutch.</p>

<p>Cag leaped up. "You can't leave me here in the desert!
I'll die."</p>

<p>Tom looked at the man, threw out the rest of the food
and water from the compartment, and gunned the huge
truck down the highway.</p>

<p>Eight hours later Tom rolled into Marsport, stopping
the big truck at the first Solar Guard substation he
could find.</p>

<p>He raced inside without cutting the jets of the truck
and reported to a sergeant seated behind the desk,
reading.</p>

<p>"I'm Cadet Tom Corbett!" he shouted. "I've got to
get in touch with Commander Walters at the Academy
right away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand where you are, Corbett!" said the sergeant,
jumping up and leveling a paralo-ray gun at him.
"You're under arrest!"</p>

<p>Tom stared, and then, spinning on his heels, dashed
out of the station, the guard's ray blasts spitting at his
heels. Jumping into the truck, he gunned the jets and
roared off into the dark Martian night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_12" id="CHAPTER_12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>


<p>"Aw, shut your big Venusian mouth!"</p>

<p>As Roger's voice roared over the intercom loud-speaker
of the speedy rocket scout, down on the power
deck Astro's face turned red.</p>

<p>"Manning," he growled into the intercom microphone,
"if I didn't need you to get me back to Mother
Earth, I'd come up there and take you apart!"</p>

<p>For four days the two cadets had been aboard the
rocket scout, circling in an orbit between Mars and
Earth, conducting equipment tests for Dave Barret.
They had become bored with the routine work and
spent most of their time needling each other, but as
Roger said, at least they were in space.</p>

<p>"O.K., let's knock off the space gas!" called Roger
over the intercom. "It's time to run another test. Want
to come up topside and take a hand?"</p>

<p>"Be right there, Roger!" said Astro. He set the power-deck
controls on automatic, and then, with a quick look
around to make sure everything was shipshape, he
climbed the ladder to the control deck.</p>

<p>Roger was standing at the chart table, audiophones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
on his ears, listening for the automatic astral chronometer
time-check broadcast on a suprahigh-frequency
audio channel from the giant electronic clock in the
Tower of Galileo. All spaceship chronometers were
checked against this huge clock regularly, in order to
maintain constant uniform time so necessary for the
delicate art of astrogation between celestial bodies.</p>

<p>Astro started to speak to the blond-haired cadet, but
Roger waved him off, listening for the signal. Suddenly
he looked up at their own chronometer above the control
board and took off the audiophones, smiling his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Right on the split second, Astro," he said.</p>

<p>"O.K.," replied the big Venusian. "Then let's run that
test and get it over with."</p>

<p>"Right," said Roger, turning back to the control
panel. "Do you want to go outside this time?"</p>

<p>"I might as well," replied Astro. "Give me a change
of scenery."</p>

<p>The big Venusian turned to a locker, pulled out a
bulky space suit, and climbed into it quickly. Adjusting
the space helmet, he nodded at Roger and stepped into
the air-lock chamber, pulling the hatch closed behind
him. While waiting for the oxygen in the small chamber
to be pumped back into the ship and the pressure to be
equalized with the vacuum of space outside, he checked
his helmet intercom to insure a clear line of communication
with Roger.</p>

<p>The red hand closed on the <i>zero</i> of the gauge over
the door and Astro moved to the outer hatch. He unlocked
it, swung the door open, and slowly climbed out
into the fantastic beauty of endless space. No sooner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
was he outside than the synthetic gravity generators
lost their pull on his body and he started into space.
Tightly grasping two metal handles in the hull, the big
cadet performed a quick somersault and planted his
feet firmly on the hull. His magnetic-soled space boots
held him fast and he called Roger over his helmet intercom.</p>

<p>"I'm outside, Roger," he reported. "On my way down
to the exhaust."</p>

<p>"Right," came Roger's voice over the intercom. "Let
me know when you're ready."</p>

<p>Without replying, Astro made his way slowly and
carefully down the length of the rocket scout toward
the main drive rocket assembly. Stopping at the trailing
edge of the hull, where it enclosed the four rockets, the
big Venusian squatted on his heels, making certain the
soles of his space boots stayed in contact with the metal
of the hull. He peered over the edge and braced himself
in a position where he could observe the individual
rocket exhausts.</p>

<p>"O.K., Roger!" he called into his intercom. "Open up
number one."</p>

<p>"Number one, aye," replied Roger. "And watch yourself,
you big baboon. Don't burn your nose!"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, go ahead!" growled Astro in reply.</p>

<p>A long tongue of flame shot out of the exhaust of the
number one tube and, after drawing back momentarily,
Astro watched the tube keenly.</p>

<p>"You know," he commented idly as he kept his eyes
fixed on the tube, "I still can't figure out what's so
different about these tubes. They're exactly the same as
any others I've ever seen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-136.png" width="500" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"That's how much you know, Astro," snorted Roger.
"Dave Barret said they were using a new duralumin alloy
in the tubes."</p>

<p>"Still doesn't look any different to me," persisted
Astro. "And for us to spend four whole days out here testing
them"&mdash;he paused and shook his head&mdash;"seems like
an awful waste of time," he concluded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you care? We're out in space, aren't we?
Or would you rather be back on guard duty?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," replied Astro. "But even space
gets dull after a while with nothing to do. Barret sure
gave us an old crate. Not even a long-range receiver
aboard."</p>

<p>"What do you want to listen to?" snorted Roger.
"Flight orders and all the rest of that rocket wash?"</p>

<p>"Be a relief to listen to somebody else beside you for
a change," snapped Astro. "Anyhow, suppose something
important happened. Suppose our orders were
changed. How would we know about it?"</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" replied Roger.
"We've got our orders&mdash;straight from Barret. As long as
we follow them, we won't get into trouble."</p>

<p>"For a change," murmured Astro.</p>

<p>"Now cut the griping and finish up out there!"</p>

<p>"O.K.," sighed Astro. "That's enough on number one.
Give me number two."</p>

<p>The ship bucked slightly as one rocket tube was cut
out and another flared at full power, but Astro clung to
the hull tightly, continuing his observations. With troubled
eyes he watched all four rocket tubes in operation,
unable to understand the difference between these
tubes and the standard makes. Finally he shrugged his
shoulders, and rising to his feet, called Roger again.</p>

<p>"That's enough, pal," he said. "I'm coming in."</p>

<p>"O.K.," replied Roger from the control deck. "And
don't fall all over your big feet."</p>

<p>In five minutes the Venusian cadet was inside the air
lock again, and as the pressure was boosted to equalize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
with the interior of the ship, he removed his space suit
and helmet. He opened the inner hatch and stepped
into the control deck to see Roger staring at the teleceiver
in openmouthed astonishment. A harsh voice
was coming over the loud-speaker.</p>

<p>"... Order you to cut all power and stand by for a
boarding party, or I'll open fire immediately!"</p>

<p>With an exclamation of startled surprise, Astro
rushed to the teleceiver screen and saw a man in the
uniform of the Solar Guard, his face grim and purposeful.
Just as Astro was about to speak, the officer spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Did you hear me? This is Captain Newton aboard
the cruiser <i>Regulus</i>! I order you to cut all power and
stand by or I'll open fire! Acknowledge!"</p>

<p>"Roger," gasped Astro, "what's this all about?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," stammered the blond-haired cadet.
He grabbed the teleceiver microphone and called
into it rapidly.</p>

<p>"Rocket scout 4J9 to <i>Regulus</i>. This is Space Cadet
Roger Manning. There must be some mistake, sir. Cadet
Astro and I are out here on special assignment for
the Space Projectile project."</p>

<p>"I know who you are!" shouted Newton. "If you don't
stand by, I'll open fire! This is your last warning!"</p>

<p>Astro grabbed the mike from Roger's hand.</p>

<p>"All right!" he bellowed. "We don't know what it's all
about, but for the love of Saturn's rings, don't start
shooting."</p>

<p>Captain Newton nodded grimly. "Very well," he said.
"Bring your ship to a dead stop in space and open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
your starboard air lock. I will send a jet boat over to
you."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," said Astro.</p>

<p>When the Solar Guard captain signed off and his image
faded from the teleceiver screen, Astro and Roger
numbly complied with Newton's abrupt orders, bringing
the ship to a dead stop in space and opening the starboard
air lock. Then the two cadets sat in the main deck
of the small scout and waited, their faces showing their
concern. Neither felt like talking. They were so confused
that they didn't know what to say. Finally Roger
got up and in a daze walked to the chart table to note
the time of the tests in the log. Then he automatically
logged the time of Newton's order.</p>

<p>Suddenly he threw the pencil down and turned to
Astro.</p>

<p>"Blast it!" he shouted. "What's this all about?"</p>

<p>Astro merely grunted, shrugged his shoulders, and
slumped further down in his chair. The big cadet was
worried. Anything that threatened his career at the
Space Academy made him literally tremble with fear.
In his whole life there was never anything that he
wanted more than to be an officer in the Solar Guard.
And the only way that could be accomplished was by
being a Space Cadet. Now he was under arrest. He
didn't stop to reason why. All he knew was that it was
a direct threat to his future as a power-deck officer in
the Solar Guard.</p>

<p>The two boys felt the metallic thump of something
hitting the hull of their rocket scout. They realized
immediately that it was the sound of the jet boat coupling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
on their ship and they turned to face the air-lock hatch.</p>

<p>Captain Newton was the first to step through the air-lock
hatch and he was followed by six Space Marines,
holding their ray guns leveled.</p>

<p>"I am Captain Newton of the Solar Guard, in command
of the rocket cruiser <i>Regulus</i>," he announced. "I
arrest you in the name of the Solar Alliance." The officer
handed over the standard warrant that was used by
the Solar Guard.</p>

<p>Roger read it slowly. It was a simple warrant for their
arrest, on the grounds of desertion, taking a Solar Guard
vessel without permission, and being absent without
leave from Space Academy. Stunned, the cadet handed
it to Astro who had been reading it over his shoulder,
his face white with shock.</p>

<p>"And I warn you, Cadet Manning," continued Newton,
"that anything you say from now on may be used
against you."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir," said Roger, dazed.</p>

<p>"Then do I have your word," said Newton, "on your
honor as Space Cadets, that you will not make any attempt
to escape or in any way jeopardize my authority
over you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," nodded Roger.</p>

<p>"On my honor, sir," said Astro, gulping, "as a Space
Cadet."</p>

<p>"All right," said Newton. "Then I'll let you take the
scout back to the Academy yourselves. I'll escort you in
the <i>Regulus</i>."</p>

<p>He turned to the squad of Space Marines and nodded.
They filed into the air lock and Newton followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
slowly. He paused in the hatch and looked back at the
two cadets, a momentary gleam of sympathy in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"You'd better be prepared for a rough time, boys," he
said. "Major Connel is going to haul you in front of a
court-martial as soon as you land."</p>

<p>"But what've we done?" Astro suddenly exploded.</p>

<p>"The charges are listed in the warrant, Cadet Astro!"</p>

<p>"But that's all wrong!" protested Astro. "We were
ordered to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold it, Astro," Roger interrupted. "Let's stop and
figure this out first. We can tell our side at the
court-martial!"</p>

<p>Captain Newton looked at the two boys piercingly
for a second, then turned and entered the air lock, slamming
the hatch closed behind him. Slowly and thoughtfully,
Astro and Roger prepared to get their ship under
way. They were still stunned by the sudden turn of
events.</p>

<p>They had no idea what had happened. But they
knew Dave Barret was at the heart of their troubles.
They vowed silently that he wouldn't get away with it!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This time it was not a cadet court that Roger and
Astro faced. It was a five-man board of Solar Guard officers,
consisting of four captains and one major, who
conducted the court-martial in closed session. Only the
defendants and the complaining witnesses were allowed
to be present. The evidence the board heard was as
damaging to the boys as it was bewildering. Major Connel
testified to their being absent without leave and taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
a Solar Guard space vessel without permission.
Firehouse Tim Rush stated that they had deserted their
stations. When Roger was called to the stand, he entered
the only defense he could, stating that he and Astro had
been operating under Dave Barret's orders. The board
immediately called Barret in to testify and his words
blasted the cadets' case to smithereens.</p>

<p>"... I have no idea what they were doing out in
that rocket scout," he stated calmly. "I certainly didn't
send them up on any such ridiculous tests. If you will
examine the exhaust tubes of that ship, you'll see that
they're made of standard materials used in all Solar
Guard ships." He turned to the board, casually. "No,
gentlemen," he continued, "I don't know what these
boys are talking about. You can call Professor
Hemmingwell in, if you like. I'm sure he'll vouch for what
I've said."</p>

<p>As Barret stepped down from the stand, Astro lunged
toward him, blind with anger and shouting his fury. It
took six Space Marines to force him back to his chair.
Roger merely sat, staring blankly into space, a wry
smile curling his lips. He clearly saw the trap into
which he and his unit mate had fallen, and there was
no way out.</p>

<p>The board didn't deliberate very long after the last
testimony was taken. When they returned to the chamber,
the presiding officer addressed Roger and Astro
directly, asking formally whether they had anything to
say before sentence was passed. Roger stepped forward.</p>

<p>"I have something to say, sir," he said in a quiet but
firm voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," nodded the major.</p>

<p>"Sir," began Roger, with a glance at Astro, "this is not
a plea for mercy but understanding. We are, it is true,
nothing but boys in training to become officers of the
Solar Guard. One of the most important parts of our
training is how to take orders without question. Now at
this trial, we have been accused of three specific instances
of misconduct. We can offer no other defense
than what we have already claimed. Major Connel and
Warrant Officer Rush have stated that we should have
cleared Barret's orders with them first, since Barret is
only a civilian and has no right to give us orders. That
may very well be true. But I submit this for your consideration,
gentlemen&mdash;" Roger paused and looked up
and down the line of stony-faced officers. "What would
have been your judgment," he resumed, "if Dave Barret
had asked us to do these things and we had refused?
Would you have been less hard on us? That's all, sir."</p>

<p>Roger stepped back abruptly and the officers stirred
uncomfortably. They recognized the merit in Roger's
statement, and had not the decision been made, there
was more than one who might have reconsidered, remembering
their own difficulties as Space Cadets. However,
the presiding officer picked up a sheet of paper
and addressed the boys coldly.</p>

<p>"While I must compliment Cadet Manning for his
admirable statement," he said, "it does not change the
decision of this board. Normally, these offenses would
be punished by immediate dismissal from the Cadet
Corps. However, in view of their past record at the
Academy, it is the decision of this board to exercise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
some lenience. Cadet Roger Manning, Cadet Astro, you
are sentenced to serve on the enlisted man's work gangs
here at Space Academy for a period of exactly six
months. All pay and privileges to be denied during that
time. Case is closed!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_13" id="CHAPTER_13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>


<p>"Atom City rocket liner now loading on Ramp Two!"</p>

<p>The metallic voice of the dispatcher echoed through
the waiting room of the subspaceport on the outskirts
of Marsport and the passengers began moving toward
the field gate, where the stewards of the ship checked
each ticket against the liner's seating plan. Near them,
a squad of four Space Marines scrutinized all passengers
carefully as they boarded the waiting jet cars that
would take them to the ship far out in the middle of the
field.</p>

<p>Tom Corbett sat at the refreshment stand in the waiting
room, sipping a glass of milk thoughtfully and eying
the squad of Space Marines. He wore a big-billed hat
pulled low over his face and a tight-fitting black jacket,
the standard uniform of a merchant spaceman.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" asked the pretty waitress behind the
counter.</p>

<p>"Yeah," growled Tom. "Gimme another glass of milk
and another of these crummy sandwiches."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't have to be rude about it!" snapped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the girl. "Somebody should teach you space tramps
some manners!"</p>

<p>As she flounced off angrily the young cadet smiled.
He knew his disguise must be good indeed to fool this
young girl, who met hundreds of people at the spaceport
every day and could easily recognize a person for
what he truly was. Now his only hope was that the disguise
would fool the squad of Marines at the gate.</p>

<p>After having abandoned the jet truck, Tom had
moved through the glittering city of Marsport carefully,
keeping to the dark alleys and shadows. Gradually he
had worked his way back to the area around Sloppy
Sam's where, for a few credits, he had been able to buy
a merchant spaceman's clothes with no questions asked.
He buried his cadet uniform in the loose ground near a
construction project.</p>

<p>Then, staying in the area, he wandered in and out of
the dingy bars and restaurants looking for the man he
had seen at the spaceport, the driver of the truck that
had crashed the fence.</p>

<p>He spent three days in his search, not daring to ask
questions, simply keeping his eyes open for the man.
Finally he had been forced to abandon the search when
he saw a stereo newscast reporting that the missing cadet,
Tom Corbett, had been traced to Skid Row. He decided
that it was time to leave Mars and went to the
huge main spaceport, hoping to get aboard a ship
bound for Earth. But the Space Marines were stationed
at every gate, examining each departing passenger carefully,
and Tom knew it would be impossible to get past
them. Then he noticed a poster advertising special non-scheduled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
flights to Atom City, Earth, at reduced rates,
that would blast off from a subspaceport on the outskirts
of the city. With renewed hope, he had gone
there immediately and bought a ticket. Space Marines
were on guard here too, but only a small squad. The
cadet resolved to make his break here. He had no other
choice.</p>

<p>"Here's your milk!" said the waitress, slopping it
down on the counter before the cadet. "And your sandwich!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/ill-147.png" width="369" height="600" alt="Tom saw that the Space Marines were watching

<span class="caption">Tom saw that the Space Marines were watching
the passengers very closely</span><br />
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Picture originally on page 137; Moved to correspond to text.">Note</ins></div>

<p>Tom paid for the order and took his time about
chewing the stale sandwich. He knew he had to get
aboard the ship that was loading now, but the Space
Marines were watching the passengers very closely.
Suddenly Tom saw a spaceport attendant race up to the
squad and hand a message to the sergeant in command
of the squad. Leaving the counter, Tom walked quickly
to a newsstand near the gate, where he could stand
close to the Marines. The sergeant read the message
quickly and turned to his squad. Tom strained his ears
to listen.</p>

<p>"We have to move out of here or we'll never get out,"
he said. "There's a Martian sandstorm coming this way.
It should hit in about fifteen minutes. This will be the
last flight. Then nothing will get off the ground until it
blows over. May last for days."</p>

<p>"But what about that cadet?" asked the man nearest
to the sergeant. "What if he shows up?"</p>

<p>"Just about all the passengers for this flight are
aboard now," growled the sergeant. "Besides, do you
see him anywhere?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom turned his back to the troopers quickly and
heard the Marine reply, "Naw."</p>

<p>"Then get your gear and pile on the truck outside,"
ordered the sergeant, "or we'll be living in this station
for a couple of days."</p>

<p>The Marines quickly marched away from the gate,
through the waiting room, and out the door.</p>

<p>Tom dug into his pocket for the ticket to Atom City
and stepped quickly to the gate, presenting his ticket to
the steward. "Spaceman Wilson!" Tom growled.</p>

<p>The steward checked his ticket casually and announced,
"Seat fourteen, berth twelve!"</p>

<p>Tom walked through the gate, trying to look casual.</p>

<p>"Hey you!" There was a sudden cry of alarm behind
Tom and for a moment he was tempted to run. But he
turned slowly and looked back. The man at the newsstand
was shouting at him.</p>

<p>"Ya tryin' to steal my paper?" he yelled.</p>

<p>Tom looked down and saw that he was still holding
the paper he had picked up to hide his face from the
Marines. He smiled, reached into his pocket for a coin,
and flipped it back to the man.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he called and walked on.</p>

<p>He hurried through a tunnel to the open area of the
field where the other passengers were waiting in jet
cars. He slipped into the nearest one and settled down
beside a fat woman. She looked at him archly, sniffed
audibly, and turned to stare out the window. Tom
merely grinned and settled deeper in the seat. In a moment
the jet cab was speeding across the small field to
the waiting passenger ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Safely inside the ship, Tom sank into his assigned
seat, buckled his acceleration belt, and listened to the
voice of the skipper counting off the seconds until blast
off.</p>

<p>"Five, four, three, two, one, <i>zero</i>!"</p>

<p>There was very little acceleration shock, since this
was a vessel designed for the comfort of the passengers.
In fact, Tom found it difficult to determine just exactly
when it left the ground. The force of the drive pushed
him deep in his seat, to be sure, but it was a gradual
pressure and not at all like the sudden violent jerk that
came when he gunned the <i>Polaris</i>.</p>

<p>He smiled. There was considerably less power in this
ship than in the <i>Polaris</i>!</p>

<p>The thought of the giant rocket cruiser made him
think about Roger and Astro. He wondered what they
were doing and if they had stayed out of trouble.</p>

<p>During the trip back to Atom City, Tom kept to himself,
avoiding the other passengers on the ship as much
as possible, taking his meals in his berth. The cadet had
a lot of thinking to do. Though temporarily safe, he
knew he couldn't dodge the Solar Guard forever. He
kept track of his pursuit by stereo newscasts which the
ship picked up from both Mars and Earth, and he was
pleased to learn that the Marines and Solar Guardsmen
were still searching for him in Marsport.</p>

<p>There was one bit of information that was general
news to the others on the ship, but of particular interest
to Tom. He had sat up in his berth and listened.</p>

<p>"... The report of a sabotage attempt on a highly
secret project now in progress at Space Academy was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
denied today by project officials and Commander Walters.
The commander said there was no basis for the report
that the entire control panel of a new type ship
had been destroyed."</p>

<p>Tom switched off his set and settled back in his bunk.
He saw through the denial by Commander Walters.
There was no need to upset the public and, more important,
let the saboteur know how successful he had
been.</p>

<p>Though Tom knew who was responsible, this knowledge
did not mean much while he was still a fugitive.
He would have to have proof. He would have to have
more than just <i>his</i> word and accusation to make his
charges stick. But how to get it?</p>

<p>"Attention," boomed the voice of the captain over the
ship's loud-speaker. "Fasten your deceleration belts,
please! We land at Atom City in thirty minutes. Fasten
your deceleration belts, please!"</p>

<p>Certain he wouldn't be seen by the passengers and
crew strapped in for the landing, Tom slipped out of his
berth and down the companionway to the luggage compartment.
Safely inside, he examined the contents of
several expensive-looking bags, opening them by
springing the locks with his knife. Finally he found a
set of civilian clothes that would fit him. Leaving a hundred
credits in the suitcase, more than the clothes were
worth, he returned to his berth where he quickly
washed, shaved, and dressed in the stolen clothes,
steadying himself against the lurching of the ship as it
made its landing approach.</p>

<p>When the ship finally touched down at the Atom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
City spaceport, Tom waited in his berth until he was
sure most of the passengers had left. Then he walked
quickly out of the ship, head down and hat pulled low
over his face, to lose himself in the crowded spaceport.</p>

<p>Safe for the time being, at least until the Solar Guard
traced him to Earth, Tom moved openly through the
streets of Atom City and went directly to the monorail
station where he purchased a ticket for Space Academy.
He boarded a local train instead of the express
and rode the jet-propelled train in the comfort of the
dining car where he had a huge meal.</p>

<p>The stop before the Academy was a small village that
catered to the wants of the hundreds of civilian workers
at the Academy spaceport. Tom had been there many
times with Astro and Roger, and knew of a small hotel
where he could hide out until he could contact his unit
mates.</p>

<p>It was early evening when Tom registered at the hotel
under the name of Joseph Cazippi, an engineer from
Titan Colony. Safely in his room, Tom turned to the
window and stared longingly at the Tower of Galileo in
the distance, as it caught the last of the sun's rays and
gleamed proudly against the gathering night sky.</p>

<p>He whirled away from the window and froze as
someone knocked on the door and a young voice called:</p>

<p>"Lemme in, Tom!"</p>

<p>The young cadet gulped in fear. Someone had recognized
him! He wondered if he should open the door or
slip out of the window and leave.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom!" the voice called. "This is Tiny! Come
on, lemme in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tiny!" shouted Tom in swift relief. He opened the
door and a small boy of about twelve stepped inside.</p>

<p>"Hiya, Tom," greeted the boy enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Tom grinned his welcome. He and Roger and Astro
had met the youngster on several of their trips to the
village and had become great friends. They always had
to tell him stories about the Cadet Corps.</p>

<p>"How did you know I was here, Tiny?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I followed you from the monorail station," replied
the boy. "You couldn't fool me in those civvies. Where's
your uniform?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that now," said Tom, kneeling before
him. "Look, Tiny, can you keep a secret?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" said the boy gleefully. "Sure I can, Tom."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm on a secret assignment, see?" whispered
the cadet with a conspiratorial air. "And I need someone
like you to help me. But you can't tell anyone I'm
here!"</p>

<p>"Sure, I understand, Tom. Whatcha want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Go to the Academy and find Astro and Roger. Tell
them to come here at nine o'clock tonight. But remember,
don't talk to anyone else!"</p>

<p>"O.K.!" replied the youngster. "I getcha! You going
to catch spies, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet, Tiny. But you do what I told you
and then hurry right back to me and tell me what they
said!"</p>

<p>The boy nodded and hurried off. From the window,
Tom watched him climb on his jet bike and roar off into
the gathering darkness toward the Academy.</p>

<p>It was nearly two hours before he heard the jet bike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
return and he hurried to the door, waiting impatiently
for the boy to come in. When the door opened and Tiny
stepped in, Tom sensed immediately that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>"Tom!" gasped Tiny, his eyes wide with shock. "You
know what happened?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Roger and Astro&mdash;" the boy stopped, seemingly unable
to go on.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see them?" demanded Tom.</p>

<p>"Naw, I couldn't. They wouldn't let me."</p>

<p>"Who wouldn't let you?"</p>

<p>"The guards."</p>

<p>"What guards? What are you talking about, Tiny?"</p>

<p>"The guards at the jail! Roger and Astro are on the
enlisted man's work gang for six months!" said Tiny.</p>

<p>Hiding his shocked surprise, Tom hurriedly gave the
boy a ten-credit note and swore him to silence.</p>

<p>"Now you hurry home, Tiny, and don't tell anyone
you've seen me!" he said.</p>

<p>"O.K., Tom," replied the boy. "But what does it all
mean?"</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," said Tom grimly. "And when I find
out, Tiny, I promise you I'll let you know."</p>

<p>When Tom was finally alone, he stood at the window,
staring at the gleaming tower, now lighted and shining
brilliantly in the darkness. He suddenly felt that he
would never see the tower again.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_14" id="CHAPTER_14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>


<p>"Stand clear!"</p>

<p>Professor Hemmingwell's voice rang over the roar of
activity in the hangar as the huge new control panel
was lifted along the hull to a large hole that had been
cut into the side of the experimental ship at the control-deck
level.</p>

<p>"Easy does it!" called the professor, standing on the
deck and peering through the hole. "Careful now!"</p>

<p>Now even with the hole, the panel was slowly pulled
into the ship by the workers. Even Major Connel and
Steve Strong lent a hand, setting it into place. When it
had been securely anchored, a team of technicians
swarmed over the panel to begin the intricate work of
connecting all the controls to the various parts of the
ship, and Hemmingwell and the two Solar Guard officers
stepped back to watch them.</p>

<p>"This puts us back on schedule now," said the professor,
turning, red-eyed and tired, to Connel and Strong.
"It was a good idea of yours, Steve, to prefabricate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
panel and have it put into position all at once. If we had
tried to install it piece by piece, we'd be weeks behind."</p>

<p>"Good work, Steve," Connel chimed in.</p>

<p>Strong merely nodded his thanks. He was tired. More
tired than he had ever been in his life. Not only had he
supervised the construction of the new control panel,
but he had been working on a special report to present
to the Solar Guard Review Board requesting another
trial for Astro and Roger. And he had spent every spare
minute haunting the MP headquarters of the Solar
Guard for word of Tom. So, he accepted the compliments
of Connel and Professor Hemmingwell with little
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You better get some rest, Steve," said Connel, aware
of Strong's attitude. "I know how hard you've been
working these past few days. So knock off and I want
your word that you will go back to your quarters and
get some sleep!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Major," replied Strong, "I can't give you my
word about that."</p>

<p>Connel's face darkened with anger. "All right! Then
do what you want. Get out!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Strong merely nodded and left the ship.</p>

<p>Outside the hangar, he stopped suddenly when he
saw Dave Barret step off the slidewalk from the Academy
and stride toward him. The young captain
clenched his teeth in sudden anger. He had talked to
Astro and Roger many times since they had been put
on the work gang and they swore that their story of
their ill-fated flight was true. Strong could not believe
that they would lie. He had been too close to them and
had, many times, put his very life into their hands. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
there seemed to be no way to break Barret's story. He
waited for the man to pass him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Strong," said Barret, as though surprised.
"Well, how's the genius? Get the control panel
in this morning?"</p>

<p>Barret was annoyed that Strong's plan to replace the
control panel had been accepted over his own. The captain
returned his cold stare and nodded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-157.png" width="500" height="411" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"It's in," he said, and then added, "I would like to ask
you a few questions, Barret."</p>

<p>"Sorry, haven't got time!" replied Barret curtly as he
tried to brush past Strong. But the young captain
grabbed him by the arm and spun him around.</p>

<p>"Make time!" he snarled. "I want the straight story
about that so-called test flight!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Barret glared at Strong. "I suggest that you let go of
my arm, Captain," he threatened, "or I will be forced to
bring charges of assault against you!"</p>

<p>Realizing an open fight would be useless, Strong released
his grip on the man's arm and turned away
quickly. Barret's mocking laugh echoed in his ears as he
stepped on the slidewalk and glided away toward the
Academy. Behind him, the big hangar buzzed with the
sound of men working in high gear again. The mighty
ship and its specially designed equipment seemed at
last to be ready for testing. But Strong felt none of the
excitement. It mattered little to the Solar Guard captain
whether the project was a success or failure. His
thoughts were of the three cadets in his unit, who were,
first and foremost, his responsibility.</p>

<p>With double guards around the hangar area and even
tighter security restrictions than before, the unknown
saboteur was unable to attack the precious ship again.
But he struck elsewhere. The single track monorail that
Barret had run into the area was blocked by an explosion
in the mouth of the tunnel. Nearly a thousand tons
of rock and earth had fallen on the hangar side, blocking
delivery of vital equipment.</p>

<p>With powerful earth-moving machinery, the tunnel
was cleared of the heavy rocks and dirt, and all that remained
was a general cleaning up, and the enlisted
man's work gangs had been assigned to that job.</p>

<p>Nearly a hundred tough, battle-scarred spacemen
from the enlisted ranks of the Solar Guard worked in
the area, stripped to the waist, their bodies burned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
brown from the sun. Sent to the work gang for petty
offenses, rather than for criminal acts, the enlisted men as
a whole did not mind the work. They were under
guard, watched by a squad of Space Marines armed
with paralo-ray guns, but there was no attempt to make
the men feel as if they were criminals. Most of the
sentences were short, usually running from five to thirty
days, with some extreme cases serving as long as three
months. But no one had ever remembered a Space Cadet
working on the squad, and particularly for six
months! It was an extraordinary situation and the
guards, as well as the men on the work details,
sympathized with Roger and Astro. They realized that
nothing really serious had been done, or the boys would
have been sent to the prison asteroid, where all true
criminals were sent. So a true spirit of comradeship
developed between the cadets and the enlisted men.</p>

<p>When Captain Strong arrived to speak to Roger and
Astro, he found them in the tunnel, working as a team
of a shoveler and a sweeper. Roger would sweep up a
little pile of dirt and Astro would shovel it into a
handcart nearby.</p>

<p>"All right, you Venusian pug!" bawled Roger. "Police
the joint!"</p>

<p>Astro scooped up the little pile of dirt neatly and
deposited it in the truck.</p>

<p>"Manning, what made the spaceship cross to Pluto?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"To get to the other side of the universe," said Roger.</p>

<p>"All right," interrupted Strong. "If you two will cut
out the comedy, I'd like to talk to you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Captain Strong!" yelled Roger. "Hey, fellas! Look!"
He turned to the other men on the work gang. "We're
special characters! See? We have visitors during working
hours!"</p>

<p>Strong laughed with the others, and then motioning
for Roger and Astro to follow him, walked to an isolated
corner of the tunnel.</p>

<p>"How is it going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Fine, sir," said Roger. "We have no complaints."</p>

<p>"Yeah," chimed in Astro with a grin. "The food is better
here than at the Academy!"</p>

<p>"Give this Venusian bum a good kitchen and he'd go
to the Rock!" Roger laughed.</p>

<p>Strong noted their lean, brown bodies and decided
that a little work in the sun with a pick and shovel had
done them good. But six months of it would interfere
with their work at the Academy and could hold them
back.</p>

<p>He told them of the work he had been doing to have
their case renewed by the Solar Guard Review Board
and asked them for any special details in their relationship
with Barret that might lend weight to his plea for
outright pardon, rather than just a commutation of sentence.
He wanted it clear on their records that they
had been accused unjustly, and that, therefore, their
sentence was an error.</p>

<p>But neither Astro nor Roger could add anything to
what the young captain already knew. He finally turned
to leave, cautioning them both to stay out of trouble,
especially Roger.</p>

<p>"Manning," he warned, "your mouth is your big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
weakness. I'm detailing Astro to make sure it stays
closed!"</p>

<p>"You see?" gloated Astro. "You see who the captain
trusts!"</p>

<p>"Listen, you big bum!" began Roger angrily, then
stopped and grinned. "O.K., Captain Strong, I'll keep
on the ball."</p>

<p>"You'd better," Astro interrupted, "or I'll stand you
on your head!"</p>

<p>With a pat on the back, Strong left them. Just as he
was about to leave the tunnel, Roger called after him:</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything about Tom, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not a word," replied Strong grimly. "So far as I
know, he's still on Mars."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a fugitive?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Yes, Astro. The Solar Guard is still looking for him."</p>

<p>Strong watched the two cadets turn back to their
work dejectedly, and then, sighing with weariness, he
headed back to the slidewalk. In the morning he would
check the reports of the Security Section for word of
Tom. Then he squared his shoulders determinedly. He
would check them now!</p>

<p>He could not go to bed yet. Not while Tom was still
missing and while Astro and Roger were on the work
gang. He would not sleep until they were free and the
<i>Polaris</i> unit was together again out in space!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Tom Corbett was also unable to sleep. He had spent
the night in the village hotel tossing and turning, his
mind seething with plans to aid Roger and Astro.</p>

<p>Finally, at dawn, he got up and sneaked out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
hotel. Avoiding the convenience of the monorail, he
struck out on foot over the rugged countryside for
Space Academy. He had a plan, but the plan required
that he talk to Roger and Astro first, and then to Captain
Strong, but it had to be done secretly. He realized
that his knowledge of the identity of the saboteur
would be a more effective weapon if everyone still believed
he was on Mars.</p>

<p>After getting close enough to the Academy to use the
slidewalk system crisscrossing the huge area, he loitered
on the crowded platforms which connected the
hangar, the Academy, and the spaceport. He kept his
coat collar high and his civilian hat pulled low over his
eyes.</p>

<p>He was on the main slidewalk, moving toward the
Tower building, when his eyes picked out the familiar
close-cropped blond hair of Roger and the unmistakable
bulk of Astro on the walk leading to the hangar.
Changing at the slidewalk intersection, he took off after
them, hoping he would not be noticed in the crowd of
civilian workers. Roger and Astro were carrying tools
over their shoulders and were lagging behind the main
body of workers moving toward a huge tunnel opening.
Tom saw his chance and moved up quickly beside
them.</p>

<p>"Keep walking and don't show surprise!" he whispered
sharply.</p>

<p>But it was too much to ask. Astro and Roger jumped
in surprise and let out involuntary shouts of joy, which
attracted the attention of the guards. They noticed the
stranger in civilian clothes and stared at him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tom!" exclaimed Roger. "What the devil are
you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Sh!" hissed Tom. "We haven't got much time." He
saw one of the guards turn and stare at him. "Listen to
me," he continued quickly. "I've got important dope
about the saboteur!"</p>

<p>"How?" gasped Astro.</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied Tom. "Now, to nail him, I've
got to get him into the act! I need proof!"</p>

<p>"But who is it?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you now. Here comes the guard. Are you
going to be working around here long?"</p>

<p>"At least another three days," said Roger. "But
who&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Roger noticed the guard move up to them and he
suddenly straightened up and snorted derisively, "Yeah.
But why a guy should want to join the Solar Guard is
more than I can see. You must be wacky, mister!"</p>

<p>He and Astro walked away, and after a hesitant look
at Tom, the guard followed the two cadets. Tom
boarded the slidewalk heading back toward the Academy.
So far, so good. He knew where his unit mates
were, but up ahead, in the gleaming Tower of Galileo,
was his second target, Captain Strong. His skipper had
to listen to him, had to be sympathetic and help him
catch the saboteur. It was the only way Tom could
clear his own name and free Roger and Astro.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_15" id="CHAPTER_15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>


<p>"Scott!"</p>

<p>"Here!" bellowed a grizzled spaceman in reply to
Major Connel's call.</p>

<p>"Augutino!"</p>

<p>"Here!"</p>

<p>"Jones!</p>

<p>"Present!"</p>

<p>"Smith!"</p>

<p>"Here!"</p>

<p>"Albert!"</p>

<p>"Here!"</p>

<p>Connel checked the last name on the clipboard and
turned to Professor Hemmingwell standing beside him
at the base of the ship. "All present and ready, sir."</p>

<p>"Fine!" said the professor. He turned and looked
around. "Where is Dave?"</p>

<p>"Here he comes now," said Connel.</p>

<p>They both watched Barret stride toward them, his
arms loaded with gear.</p>

<p>"This is the stuff I told you about, Professor," he said
as Hemmingwell looked at it curiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"What stuff?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"Portable heaters for the crew's space suits, just in
case&mdash;" Barret paused meaningfully.</p>

<p>"In case of what?" growled Connel.</p>

<p>"Why, ask them!" replied Barret, gesturing toward
the group of civilian crewmen who had been selected
for the test flight of the spaceship.</p>

<p>Connel turned to look at them, then back at Barret.
"Ask them what?" he barked.</p>

<p>"How they feel about making this flight," said Barret.</p>

<p>Connel scowled and turned to the men. "Is there
anything to what he says?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The men shuffled their feet nervously but did not
reply.</p>

<p>"Well?" exploded Connel.</p>

<p>"See, they're afraid of you, Connel," said Barret,
deliberately omitting the courtesy of using the major's
title.</p>

<p>Ignoring Barret's thrust, Connel continued to face
the men. "Is that right, men?" he shouted. "Are you
afraid of me?"</p>

<p>There was a mumble from the group and then the
man named Scott, a thick-set individual with black
flashing eyes, stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Speaking for myself," he said, looking straight at the
major, "I'm not afraid of anything that walks. And that
includes you, Major Connel. No offense meant, it's just
a statement of fact." He paused and drew a deep
breath. Then he added, "But I am afraid of this ship."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Connel, who could not help
admiring the man for his straightforward approach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's junk-jinxed," said the man, using the expression
of spacemen who believed a ship with a suspicious
accident record should be junked because it was jinxed.</p>

<p>"Junk-jinxed!" cried Connel, amazed.</p>

<p>"Preposterous," snorted Professor Hemmingwell.
"Why, you helped build this ship, Scotty! Do you doubt
the work you've put into her? Or the work of your
friends?"</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with it," replied Scott stubbornly.
"The others feel the same way I do."</p>

<p>Barret stepped forward. Arrogantly and before
Connel could stop him, he began addressing the men. "Listen,
you men!" he shouted. "You're being childish!
Why, you built this ship! How can you possibly allow
yourselves to be so stupid as to believe in an idiotic
thing like a jinx. Now, why don't you just get aboard
and stop being so ridiculously superstitious!"</p>

<p>Connel could have reached out with one of his big
hands and squeezed Barret's neck to shut him up.
Instead of allaying their fears, which even he would
admit were real enough, the man was creating further
resentment with his attack on their pride as thinking,
reasoning men.</p>

<p>"All right, all right!" he bellowed. "That's enough for
now, <i>Mister</i> Barret!" He turned to the men and he
could tell by the expressions on their faces that he had
lost them. They would not take the ship aloft. But he
had to try.</p>

<p>"Now listen," he growled. "This is a very important
project and someone has been trying to get us to wash
out the whole idea. If you don't come through, he'll succeed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
You are the best men in your fields, and if each of
you attend to your particular job, then the ship will
blast off and be a success! Now, how about it?"</p>

<p>He was met with the stony faces of men who were
afraid. Nothing he could say or offer them would get
them to take the ship off the ground. He tried a new
tack. "I'm offering you <i>double wages</i>!" he roared.</p>

<p>The men were silent.</p>

<p>"Double wages <i>and</i> a bonus!"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"All right! Beat it!" he growled. "Don't ever show
your faces around here again!"</p>

<p>Connel turned to Professor Hemmingwell. "I'll see if
I can't muster a crew from the ranks of the Solar
Guard," he said.</p>

<p>"Major," said the professor, his face worn and haggard
from the long ordeal of completing the project,
"I wouldn't want men <i>ordered</i> to man this vessel."</p>

<p>"They're in the Solar Guard and they take orders,"
said Connel.</p>

<p>"No," persisted Hemmingwell. "I will not let a man
on that ship that does not want to go. Remember, Major,
it is still my personal property."</p>

<p>"All right," said Connel grimly. "I'll see if I can recruit
a crew from the civilian workers around the Academy."</p>

<p>But Major Connel encountered the same superstitious
dread everywhere. The word had spread that the
projectile ship was jinxed. Old tales of other ships that
had gone out into space, never to be heard of again,
were recalled, and the men found instances of similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
prelaunching happenings on the projectile ship. Very
little of it was true, of course. The stories were
half-truths and legends that had been handed down through
generations of spacemen, but they seemed to have special
significance now.</p>

<p>Connel fumed and ranted, threatened and cajoled,
begged and pleaded, but it was no use. There was not a
man in the Academy who would set foot inside the
"jinxed" ship. Finally, in a last desperate attempt, he
ignored Hemmingwell's order and appealed to
Commander Walters.</p>

<p>"No, Lou. I cannot order men to take that ship up,"
Commander Walters replied, "and you know it!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" argued Connel. "You're the commander,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I most certainly am," asserted Walters, "and if I
want to get other things done in the Solar Guard, I can't
order men to take a jinxed ship off the ground." He
looked at Connel narrowly. "Do you remember the old
freighter, the <i>Spaceglow</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>Connel frowned but didn't reply.</p>

<p>"You were mate on that ship before you enlisted in
the Solar Guard," persisted Walters. "And I read the log
of your first trip when you wrote, and I quote, 'There
seems to be some mysterious and unanswerable
condition aboard this vessel that makes her behave as if she
had human intelligence....'"</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with <i>this</i> situation!" roared
Connel.</p>

<p>"They're alike! You couldn't get a crew on that wagon
in any port of call from Venus to Jupiter!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"But we found out what was wrong with her eventually!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the legend still exists that the <i>Spaceglow</i>
had intelligence of its own!" asserted Walters.</p>

<p>"All right," snorted Connel. "So we have to fight superstition!
But, blast it, Commander, we're faced with
a saboteur. There's nothing supernatural or mysterious
about a man with a bomb!"</p>

<p>Connel turned abruptly and walked out of the commander's
office, more furious than Walters had ever
seen him.</p>

<p>Back at the hangar, Connel faced the professor. It
was a tough thing to tell the elderly man, and Connel,
for all his hard exterior, could easily appreciate the professor's
feelings. After many years of struggle to convince
die-hard bankers of the soundness of his Space
Projectile plan, followed by sabotage and costly work
stoppages, it was heart-rending to have a "jinx" finally
stop him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Connel, "but that's the way things
are, Professor."</p>

<p>"I understand, Major," replied Hemmingwell wearily.
He turned away, shoulders slumping, and walked
back to his tiny office in the shadow of the mighty ship
that was anchored on the ground.</p>

<p>"May I speak to you a moment, Major?" a voice broke
the silence in the hangar.</p>

<p>Connel turned around slowly. "You!" he exclaimed.
"If it hadn't been for you and your big mouth, this ship
might be in space right now!"</p>

<p>"Stop blowing your jets!" snapped Dave Barret. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
want to see this ship in space as badly as you do. Perhaps
even more so. But listen, I'm not afraid of the jinx.
Neither are you, nor is Professor Hemmingwell. We're
spacemen. And we know the operation of every piece of
equipment on that ship. What's to prevent us from taking
her up?"</p>

<p>Connel looked at the young man, immediately recognizing
the value of his suggestion. He nodded his head
curtly. "All right," he said. "I'll take you up on that."</p>

<p>Barret grinned, stuck out his hand, and after a
friendly shake turned and ran to the professor's office.
Connel walked back to the outside of the hangar and
began bellowing orders for the giant ship to be brought
out to the blast ramp and prepared for the blast-off.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-170.png" width="500" height="402" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>But Dave Barret did not go directly to Professor
Hemmingwell's office. He made one stop. Looking
around quickly to make sure that he was not observed,
he slipped into the teleceiver booth and made a hurried
call to an Atom City number. When a gruff voice
answered, he merely said three words:</p>

<p>"It's all set!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Roger and Astro were some distance away from the
main gang, working at the tunnel mouth overlooking
the hangar area.</p>

<p>"Look, Astro," said Roger. "They're bringing out the
ship. They must be ready to blast off!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-171.png" width="500" height="414" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Astro stopped his work momentarily and stared as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the huge ship was inched out of the hangar, resting on
her tail fins, her nose pointing skyward.</p>

<p>"I'd sure like to be bucking the power deck on that
baby," sighed Astro.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and I'd give my eyeteeth to see that radar
deck," said Roger. "It must be really something with all
the gear to control those projectiles when they're
released."</p>

<p>"Do you believe any of that talk about her being
jinxed?" asked Astro.</p>

<p>"Stop being a Venusian lunkhead!" snorted Roger.
"The only thing wrong with that ship is a rocket-blasting
clever saboteur."</p>

<p>"You know," said Astro, "I've been thinking."</p>

<p>"Don't strain yourself," snorted Roger. But when
Astro failed to reply in kind, the blond-haired cadet
realized he was serious. "What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, in the name of the moons of Mars, would
Barret want to do the things he did to us?"</p>

<p>"Simple," said Roger, beginning to sweep industriously
as he saw the guard walking toward them. "He
didn't like the way we manhandled him."</p>

<p>"You think he was just getting even with us?" asked
Astro, also resuming work.</p>

<p>"What else?" asked Roger. "We made him look pretty
silly. And that was no love tap I gave him that night we
caught him in the hangar."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean," said Astro. "I know Major
Connel said he was supposed to be there. But with that
teleceiver conversation I overheard and all the rest&mdash;well,
I just don't get it," he concluded lamely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll get it in the neck if you don't watch out," said
Roger. "Here comes Spike and he doesn't like to see us
loafing!"</p>

<p>The two cadets worked steadily for ten minutes, and
when the guard finally walked away, they paused to
watch the big ship again.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Tom is up to?" said Roger thoughtfully.
"He said he knew who the saboteur was, but he
needed help to prove it."</p>

<p>"I'd give a full year's leave just to get my hands on
that guy for ten minutes," said Astro.</p>

<p>"Yeah," grunted Roger. "Well, come on, hot-shot, we
still got a lot of cleaning to do."</p>

<p>They returned to their work, but even then, as they
watched the preparations for the take-off of the big
ship, they both thought about Tom. They knew his
problems were as difficult as their own, and with much
more at stake. If Tom failed in his efforts to catch the
saboteur, it could very well mean the end of the <i>Polaris</i>
unit.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_16" id="CHAPTER_16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>


<p>"<i>Bump-ty&mdash;bump-ty&mdash;bump-ty&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>Tom Corbett's heart beat with such rapid, heavy
drumming that the young cadet felt as though it was
going to tear itself right out of his chest.</p>

<p>For nearly six hours Tom had lain in wait in Galaxy
Hall, the museum of Space Academy, on the second
floor of the Tower building. He was hiding in the tail
section of the <i>Space Queen</i>, the first rocket ship to
breach space safely, blasting from Earth to Luna and
back again. He had kept watch through a crack in the
hull of the old ship, waiting for the lights to go out, a
signal that the Academy had bedded down for the
night.</p>

<p>Now, in the silence of the museum, surrounded by
the ancient objects that traced man's progress to the
stars, Tom felt like crying. For as long as he had been
at the Academy, he had revered these crude, frail
objects and wondered if he would ever match the bravery
of the men who used them. Now, unless his plan was
successful, he would be finished as a cadet and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
dream of being an officer in the Solar Guard would vanish
forever.</p>

<p>The Tower building had been quiet for over an hour.
Tom had not heard any voices or movement other than
the evenly paced steps of the guards patrolling their
lonely beats outside.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-175.png" width="500" height="403" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He slipped out of the antiquated ship, and staying
well in the shadows, moved out into the corridor to the
head of the slidestairs. He peered over the railing to
the main floor below and saw Warrant Officer Mike
McKenny through the open door of a small office,
seated at his desk, watching an evening stereo program.
The young cadet jumped on the stairs quickly and rode
the moving belt of plastic to the upper floors where the
officers' quarters were located.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom was in great danger of discovery. No civilian
was allowed on Academy grounds after taps. And he
was still wearing the civilian clothes he had taken from
the suitcase on the passenger ship from Mars. Silently
but swiftly, he made his way from level to level toward
the seventy-fifth floor.</p>

<p>He knew that there would be a guard stationed in
the halls outside the officers' apartments and it would
be impossible to elude him. He would simply have to
brazen it out.</p>

<p>At the seventy-fifth floor the young cadet stepped off
the slidestairs noisily, his heels clicking on the dark
crystal floor, and strode down the hall. He was
immediately seen by the guard who advanced to meet him,
his ray gun at the ready. Tom was prepared.</p>

<p>"Guard!" he yelled.</p>

<p>The guard stopped in front of him, a puzzled look on
his face. "Yes?" he replied.</p>

<p>"Sir!" snapped Tom. "Show me where Captain
Strong's quarters are and be quick about it!"</p>

<p>"But who are&mdash;?" The guard started to protest, but
Tom did not give him the chance to finish.</p>

<p>"Don't stand there like an idiot, man! <i>Move!</i>"</p>

<p>"Uhh&mdash;yes, sir," stammered the guard, obviously
taken aback.</p>

<p>"Lead the way," continued Tom loudly. "I haven't
much time."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but would you mind lowering your voice,
sir? Some of the officers are asleep, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, get on then and stop jabbering!"</p>

<p>The guard turned quickly and started down the hall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Tom followed, hardly able to keep from smiling at the
man's frustration and confusion.</p>

<p>They stopped at the door to Captain Strong's
quarters and the guard rapped softly.</p>

<p>"Yes?" came a muffled voice from inside.</p>

<p>"Someone to see you, sir," called the guard.</p>

<p>"Just a moment."</p>

<p>The guard stepped to one side and stood at rigid
attention. When the door opened and Captain Strong was
revealed, Tom brushed past the guard and stepped into
the room, talking quickly.</p>

<p>"My name is Hinkleworth, Captain," he announced.
"I am here at the request of Commissioner Jessup to
discuss the installation of new radar equipment on all
Solar Guard rocket cruisers!"</p>

<p>Tom slammed the door closed behind him and
turned to face the astonished Solar Guard officer.</p>

<p>"What in the star-blazing&mdash;?" Strong began angrily.</p>

<p>"It's me, Captain Strong!" Tom said quickly, pulling
his hat off and lowering his collar.</p>

<p>"Corbett!" gasped Strong, taking an involuntary step
back, his face mirroring his disbelief.</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered the boy, motioning to the door.
Recovering his composure, Strong swept past him, opened
the door, and found the guard still standing there at
attention.</p>

<p>"All right, Corporal," said Strong. "Resume your
station."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the guard and walked down the
hall. Strong watched him for a moment, then turned
back into his room, closing and locking the door behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
him. He faced the young cadet, who grinned back at
him weakly.</p>

<p>"All right, spaceboy," said Strong, flopping in the
nearest chair. "Start at the beginning and give it to me.
<i>All of it!</i>"</p>

<p>Tom began his story with the incident of the runaway
truck at Marsport, told of his abduction and escape
from the two truckers, Cag and Monty, his efforts
to reach Space Academy, and finally revealed the identity
of the man he thought was responsible for the
whole effort to stop the projectile operation.</p>

<p>At this, Strong jumped to his feet. "That's the most
fantastic thing I've ever heard, Corbett!" he snapped.
"What kind of proof do you have?"</p>

<p>"None, sir," replied Tom. "The only reason I came
here tonight is to ask you to help me get that proof."</p>

<p>When Strong was silent, shaking his head, Tom tried
again.</p>

<p>"Sir, you do believe me, don't you?" asked the boy
with a sinking feeling in his heart. "What about all the
things that have happened to me and to Roger and
Astro?"</p>

<p>"I can explain them away just as easily as you can explain
your theory," replied Strong. He walked over and
patted the cadet on the shoulder sympathetically. "I'm
sorry, Tom," he said gently. "Your story is just too fantastic
and you haven't even the slightest shred of evidence.
Just a few words an unreliable witness said
under duress."</p>

<p>"I realize that, sir," replied the cadet. "But don't you
see? This is the only way to clear my name."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Strong turned to the window, looked out thoughtfully
for a moment, and then turned back to the boy.
"How do you think I can help you?" he said, a more
sympathetic note in his voice.</p>

<p>His eyes bright with hope again, Tom spoke quickly
and eagerly. The Solar Guard captain calmly packed
his pipe and lighted it, stopping the boy now and then
to ask a question. Finally, when Tom was finished,
Strong nodded and silently puffed at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" asked Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Tom," replied Strong. "It's a pretty
wild idea. And it leaves me way out on a limb."</p>

<p>"Only if we fail, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Which is more than likely," Strong commented
dryly.</p>

<p>"Captain Strong," said Tom, "if you really don't think
it can work, then I suggest that you call the guard and
turn me in. I've put you in enough trouble already."
Tom moved to the door.</p>

<p>"Stop playing the hero, Corbett," said Strong. "I
didn't say I wouldn't help you. But we have to think
this thing out."</p>

<p>Tom sat down, eying Strong hopefully.</p>

<p>"Now, let me get this straight," said Strong. "First
you want me to help Astro and Roger escape from the
work gang. All right, that may work easily enough. But
why?"</p>

<p>"So we can get aboard the projectile ship and go
through her tests with her."</p>

<p>"I suppose you've heard that Connel, Professor
Hemmingwell, and Dave Barret are going to take her up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Tom replied, grinning. "That's why I want
to go along. To make sure no more accidents happen."</p>

<p>"I could send a squad of Space Marines for that kind
of job," mused Strong.</p>

<p>"But that would alert Barret," protested Tom. "He
might not try anything. If he doesn't suspect he's being
watched, we may be able to catch him in the act. And
he certainly wouldn't think the three of us are aboard."</p>

<p>"Hum. Maybe you're right," nodded Strong. "Then
after I get you three on the ship, I'm supposed to spend
my time trailing your prize suspect, right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," nodded the young cadet.</p>

<p>"I'll have to give it consideration, Tom," said Strong
after a momentary pause. "As much as I admire your
plan and as much as I want to help you, this places me
in a highly untenable position. Have you stopped to
think what would happen to me if it were ever known
that I had sheltered you here in my quarters and aided
in the escape of two convicted cadets from the work
gang?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tom soberly. "And&mdash;all I can say is
I'll do whatever you think is best."</p>

<p>"Well, get some sleep now," sighed Strong. "I've got
to make a tour of the guard."</p>

<p>Without another word, Tom went into Captain
Strong's bedroom and fell asleep thirty seconds after his
head hit the pillow. His last waking thought was that if
his plan had any merit Captain Strong would help him.</p>

<p>Steve Strong did not leave his quarters immediately.
He sat in the easy chair and puffed thoughtfully on his
pipe until there was nothing left in the burnt and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
charred bowl. Then he rose and left the room to make
his rounds. He walked slowly through the hollow,
empty hallways of the Tower building, riding up and
down the slidestairs, speaking curtly to the guards, and
finally walked out on the wide steps facing the grassy
quadrangle.</p>

<p>Strong glanced up at the sky. He counted the stars
he could see and he remembered that as a boy of eight
he knew the names and positions of every one. He
recalled his entrance to the Academy as a cadet and how
his unit instructor had guided him and taught him the
many things a spaceman must know. He thought of his
long tour as a line officer in the Solar Guard fleet under
Commander Walters, then a major, and he remembered
his brother officers, many of whom were now
dead. There was one thing they all had in common, one
thing that overshadowed all personal differences. One
thing that was almost like a religion. Comradeship. A
feeling of belonging, a knowledge that there was <i>always</i>
someone who would believe in you and your ideas.</p>

<p>One thing. Friendship.</p>

<p>Captain Strong spun on his heel, walked back into
the Tower, and rode the slidestairs back to his quarters.
He had made up his mind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_17" id="CHAPTER_17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>


<p>"<i>Stand by to raise ship!</i>"</p>

<p>Connel's bull-throated roar blasted through the intercom
of the gleaming projectile ship from the power
deck where Dave Barret was stationed, up to the radar
bridge where Professor Hemmingwell waited anxiously.</p>

<p>On the main deck, seated at the controls, Connel
spoke rapidly into the audioceiver microphone.
"Projectile vessel to spaceport traffic control," he called.
"Request blast-off clearance!"</p>

<p>"Spaceport traffic control to Connel," came a voice in
reply over the audioceiver. "You are cleared. Your time
is two minutes to zero!"</p>

<p>Connel began snapping the many levers and switches
on the control panel in proper sequence, keeping a wary
eye on the astral chronometer over his head as one of
its red hands ticked off the seconds to blast-off.</p>

<p>The teleceiver screen to his right showed a view of
the stern of the vessel and Connel could see some of the
ground crew slowly rolling away the boarding equipment.
Flipping on the switch that opened a circuit to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
an outside loud-speaker, he bellowed an order for the
area to be cleared. The crew scurried back behind the
blast deflectors and watched the ship through the thick
crystal viewports.</p>

<p>"Power deck," Connel called into the intercom,
"check in!"</p>

<p>"Power deck, aye!" reported Barret.</p>

<p>"Radar deck, check in!"</p>

<p>"Radar deck, aye!" Professor Hemmingwell acknowledged
in a thin voice.</p>

<p>"Feed reactant!" Connel ordered.</p>

<p>"Reactant feeding at D-9 rate," said Barret after a
split-second pause.</p>

<p>"Energize cooling pumps!"</p>

<p>"Cooling pumps, aye!"</p>

<p>"Cut in take-off gyros!"</p>

<p>"Gyros on," repeated Barret.</p>

<p>"All clear forward and up!" replied the elderly man.</p>

<p>"Right!" bawled Major Connel. "Stand by!"</p>

<p>Tensely he watched the red hand crawl up the face
of the chronometer and he gripped the intercom microphone
tightly. "Blast off," he began, "minus five, four,
three, two, one, <i>zero</i>!"</p>

<p>Connel slammed home the master control switch and
in an instant the silver ship trembled under a tremendous
surge of power. Flame and smoke poured out of
its exhaust and slowly it began to reach for sky, straining
as if to break invisible bonds holding it to Earth. Her
jets shrieking torturously, the ship picked up speed and
then suddenly, as though shot from a cannon, it blasted
up through the atmosphere&mdash;spacebound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>A moment later, on the control deck of the ship, Major
Connel swung forward in his chair, shook off the
effects of the tremendous acceleration, and called into
the intercom, "Switch on the gravity generators!"</p>

<p>As soon as the artificial gravity was in effect, the officer
put the ship on standard cruising speed, changed
course slightly to put them on a direct heading to Mars,
and then ordered Barret and Hemmingwell to the control
deck.</p>

<p>"Well, Professor," he said as he gave the old man a
hearty handshake, "so far so good. She handles like a
baby carriage. If the projectiles work half as well, you'll
really have yourself something!"</p>

<p>Professor Hemmingwell smiled appreciatively and
turned to Barret, who was just climbing through the
hatch from the power deck. "You've done as much as
anyone to help this ship get into space, Dave," he said.
"Thank you!"</p>

<p>"Think nothing of it, Professor," replied Barret airily.</p>

<p>"Well, shall we begin the first series of tests?" asked
Connel.</p>

<p>"By all means!" said the professor enthusiastically.
"If you and Dave will check the firing stations, I'll take
care of the paper work!"</p>

<p>"Right," replied Connel. "Let's go, Barret!"</p>

<p>"I'll work outside, Major," said Barret, turning toward
the air lock. "You see that all the firing chambers are
properly loaded."</p>

<p>"Anything you say, Barret."</p>

<p>The two men turned away from the smiling professor
and left the control deck. They separated in the companionway,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Connel hurrying to the starboard firing
chambers and Barret going to the midships air lock
where he put on a space suit for his task out on the hull.</p>

<p>In two minutes the young scientist was out on the
odd-looking blisters that marked the exterior of the
firing chambers ringing the hull.</p>

<p>At each blister Barret examined the hollow firing
tube carefully. In several he made delicate adjustments
to a small metallic ring extending from the opening of
the tube. The ring was one of the most important parts
of the firing unit, emitting the long-range electronic
beam controlling the flight of the projectile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inside the ship, Connel checked the loading
of each of the chambers, making certain that each
of the ten-foot-long torpedolike projectiles was properly
secured in its blasting cradle. After fifteen minutes
and a complete trip around the ship, the major was
satisfied that all was in readiness. He returned to the
control deck, meeting Barret on the way, and they
found Professor Hemmingwell just completing his
calculations for the initial test. He turned to them, waving
a paper in front of their eyes.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said proudly, "we are almost ready.
If you will adjust course fifteen degrees to port, we'll be
in proper position for the test!"</p>

<p>"Right," nodded Connel. "Stand by below, Barret."</p>

<p>"On my way," replied Barret, disappearing through
the hatch.</p>

<p>"Well, Professor," said Connel, walking to the
controls, "this is the big moment!"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Hemmingwell. "If these rocket projectiles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
prove workable now, there's nothing to stop us
from carrying on with our test of the ground receivers
on Mars immediately."</p>

<p>"Power deck to control deck, check in!" Barret's voice
suddenly crackled over the intercom.</p>

<p>"Control deck, aye," replied Connel. "Ready to
blast?"</p>

<p>"All set!"</p>

<p>"Give me a ten-second burst on the starboard steering
rockets," ordered Connel, gripping the steering vane
control tightly.</p>

<p>"Coming up!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden, jolting blast from the stern and
Connel and Hemmingwell hung on grimly as the
mighty ship turned in space. Watching the control
panel instruments carefully, Connel slammed home the
switch that opened the powerful nose braking rockets
and brought the ship to a dead stop in space.</p>

<p>"On course, Professor, ready to fire!" Connel announced
triumphantly, and Hemmingwell took his station
before the giant projectile control board.</p>

<p>"Stand by to fire one!" said the professor, making a
minute adjustment on the panel. Behind him, Connel
unconsciously crossed his fingers.</p>

<p>"Fire one!" shouted Hemmingwell.</p>

<p>Connel pressed a red button on the panel and waited,
holding his breath. There was a distinct hissing and
then the great ship lurched slightly. On the teleceiver
overhead a white flash appeared, streaked across the
screen, and then disappeared in the darkness of space.</p>

<p>"Fire two!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Again there was a hissing sound and another white
burst of light faded into the millions of other pinpoints
of lights in the black void.</p>

<p>Over and over again, at one-minute intervals, the
projectiles were fired, until all twelve of the firing
chambers had discharged their fire-tailed missiles.</p>

<p>The professor sat back and smiled weakly at Connel.
The gruff major winked encouragingly and they both
turned to watch the teleceiver screen anxiously. The
gyros on each projectile had been preset for a circular
flight of fifteen minutes' duration. Soon they would be
returning and the delicate job of bringing them safely
aboard would begin.</p>

<p>"Here comes number one," shouted Connel, as a small
pinpoint of light appeared on the screen.</p>

<p>"I'm ready!" said the professor. He watched the
teleceiver screen carefully, made a minute adjustment of
the dial controlling the directional beam emitted by the
ring in the number-one firing chamber, and at the last
possible moment, snapped the remote-control switch
that cut the power in the approaching test projectile. It
hung dead in space, immediately over the chamber.
Gently the professor increased the power of the electro-magnetic
ring and pulled the projectile back into the
chamber as easily as slipping a hand in a glove.</p>

<p>"Success!" Connel shouted. "Professor, you've
done it!"</p>

<p>"Congratulations, sir," Dave Barret called over the
intercom from the power deck.</p>

<p>"Here comes number two," said Professor
Hemmingwell excitedly, and began to repeat the process<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
to draw the approaching projectiles back into the ship.</p>

<p>One after another, five projectiles were taken aboard
successfully. Then, as he worked on the sixth, the professor
began to frown. He rechecked his instruments
and then shook his head, obviously disturbed.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" growled Connel, noticing Hemmingwell's
growing nervousness.</p>

<p>"The homing ring on number six tube isn't working
properly," replied Hemmingwell. "I can't control the
projectile."</p>

<p>"Any idea what's wrong?" the Solar Guard officer
asked.</p>

<p>"The settings on the ring must be wrong." The professor
picked up the intercom mike. "Dave," he called,
"check in!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" replied Barret immediately.</p>

<p>"Did you check the settings on all the rings in the
firing chambers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," reported Barret. "They looked O.K. to me.
Why don't you check with Connel? He supervised their
installation."</p>

<p>"That's true," said the major. "I'll go outside and look
them over."</p>

<p>Connel turned on his heel and hurried to the air-lock
chamber. Moving with amazing speed for a big man,
he donned the space suit in the chamber while the pressure
was being equalized. As soon as the air-lock portal
opened, he scrambled out on the hull and made his way
forward to the bulging firing chambers. Stooping over
the empty tube of number six, he examined the ring
carefully and began to frown. Moving on to number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
seven, his frown deepened. By the time he checked the
rings of eight and nine, his face was a grim mask of
anger.</p>

<p>"Professor," he called into his helmet microphone,
"check in."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/ill-189.png" width="419" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, Major," replied Hemmingwell from the control
deck. "Have you found the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I sure have," Connel growled. "It's sabotage! And
now I think I know who&mdash;"</p>

<p>Connel never finished. There was a sudden burst of
power from the great ship and the officer was hurled
into space.</p>

<p>"Major!" cried Hemmingwell. "Barret! What have
you done? Connel is outside!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it, Professor," replied Barret from the
power deck. "My hand slipped and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk!" shouted Hemmingwell. "Stop the ship!"</p>

<p>"I can't! The control is jammed!"</p>

<p>As the ship surged through space and the professor
and Barret yelled at each other over the intercom, three
Space Cadets rose from their hiding place in the hold
of the ship.</p>

<p>Tom Corbett nudged Roger and Astro. "You hear
that?" he said grimly.</p>

<p>"Yeah!" replied Roger.</p>

<p>"Let's go!" growled Astro.</p>

<p>Without another word, they opened the hatch and
made their way quickly through the rocketing ship,
each going to their separate stations, according to the
prearranged plan. Roger climbed up to the radar bridge,
Tom entered the control deck, and Astro burst into the
power deck.</p>

<p>"You!" Barret cried out, his eyes wide with sudden
fear as the huge Venusian advanced on him menacingly.</p>

<p>"Get away from those controls," growled the big cadet.
"If you don't, so help me, I'll break you in two!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Barret backed away, his face white, hands pawing
the air frantically as if he were trying to push the big
cadet back.</p>

<p>"Get over there," said Astro. "Sit down and keep your
mouth shut!"</p>

<p>On the control deck, Tom was strapping himself into
the pilot's chair and calling frantically into the intercom,
"Give me a course, Roger!"</p>

<p>"One-seventy-degree turn to starboard," replied
Roger, "and full ahead! I've got the major on my scanner."</p>

<p>"Pour on the power, Astro!" shouted Tom, gripping
the controls firmly.</p>

<p>As the mighty ship blasted in a long, sweeping arc,
Professor Hemmingwell sat numbly in his chair, aware
only that the three cadets were taking the vessel back
into the area where the remaining projectiles, completely
out of control, were buzzing around in space like
maddened hornets.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_18" id="CHAPTER_18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>


<p>"There he is!"</p>

<p>Roger's voice rose to a triumphant shout on the
intercom. "Put the brakes on this wagon!"</p>

<p>"Check!" retorted Astro from the power deck, his
fingers flying over the switches of the control panel and
bringing the ship to a sudden blasting stop.</p>

<p>On the control deck, Tom turned to Professor
Hemmingwell. "I'm going outside to get Major Connel, sir,"
he said. "Do you think you'll be all right?"</p>

<p>The old man nodded absently, still dazed by the
sudden turn of events. Tom hurried past him and met
Roger coming down from the radar bridge. "I'm going
too!" the blond-haired cadet announced.</p>

<p>"You tell Astro?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. He's got Barret locked in the power-deck
storeroom and he'll take over the control deck. Wonder
if they have a jet boat aboard?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it. Not on a test flight."</p>

<p>"We'll have to hurry," said Roger as they reached
the air lock and began to scramble into space suits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tom. "He probably doesn't have much
oxygen."</p>

<p>"There's another reason," grunted Roger.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Those projectiles. We're right back in the middle of
them. Any one of them could wreck the ship."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," said Tom. "Guess it's up to
Astro to keep dodging them."</p>

<p>"Never thought I'd be out in space ducking hot
projectiles to save old Blast-off Connel's hide."</p>

<p>"Neither did I," said Tom. "But here we are."</p>

<p>Stepping into the air lock, they quickly equalized the
pressure and a moment later climbed out on the hull.</p>

<p>"See him, Roger?" asked Tom over the helmet intercom.</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Roger.</p>

<p>"I see him," called Astro from the control deck. "I got
him spotted on the teleceiver. Go aft, about a thousand,
maybe fifteen hundred yards. I'll direct you from there."</p>

<p>"Right!" snapped Roger. "And listen, you Venusian
bonehead! Make it good. I don't like being a clay pigeon
for this crazy shooting gallery out here!"</p>

<p>"Aw, damp your tubes and get to work," drawled
Astro. "Honestly, Tom, did you ever hear him <i>not</i> complain?"</p>

<p>Tom did not answer. He was busy fastening two oxygen
tanks to the front of his space suit and Roger's.
When he had finished, he checked the pressure and,
satisfied, nodded to his unit mate.</p>

<p>Opening the nozzles of the bottles, they shot away
from the ship into the nothingness of space.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have to go about fifteen degrees to your starboard
and five degrees up on the ecliptic," called Astro
from the control deck. "You'll hit Connel right on the
nose!"</p>

<p>"Right!" replied Tom, turning the nozzle of the oxygen
bottle to the left and immediately shooting off in
the indicated direction. Roger followed quickly and
expertly.</p>

<p>"See him?" called Tom.</p>

<p>"No," replied Roger. "Are you sure, you big clunk?"</p>

<p>"He's right above you!" snorted Astro over the intercom.
Then his voice rose in alarm. "No! That isn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Duck, Tom!" cried Roger.</p>

<p>Tom opened the nozzle of his oxygen bottle wide and
turned it. As he shot away, a projectile roared through
the area he had just left.</p>

<p>Roger had done the same thing, flipping over and
shooting up and away from the moving object.</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Tom. "That was close!"</p>

<p>"You blockhead!" roared Roger. "What are you trying
to do to us? Set us up for coffins?"</p>

<p>"For you, that's not a bad idea, Manning!" snorted
Astro. "Just damp your tubes. I made a mistake."</p>

<p>"Some mistake!" growled Roger.</p>

<p>Tom and Roger maneuvered back together, and locking
arms so they would not drift apart, scanned the
void around them for Connel. Suddenly Tom jerked
free. "Roger!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What is it?" replied the cadet. "Do you see him?"</p>

<p>"There!" Tom pointed back to the ship. "On the stern!
He's hanging on to the cleat over the main tubes!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/ill-195.png" width="417" height="500" alt="&quot;He&#39;s hanging on to the cleat over the main tube!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;He&#39;s hanging on to the cleat over the main tube!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Astro," Roger called, "we're coming back in. We've
spotted him."</p>

<p>"I heard you!" said Astro. "Must've come back on his
own steam. Go get him, quick!"</p>

<p>Turning the nozzles of their oxygen tanks, the two
cadets shot toward the ship. They quickly clambered
onto the stern where Connel lay stretched out on the
side of the hull, arms extended, his gloved hands gripping
the small cleat on the side of the hull.</p>

<p>In a matter of minutes, the two boys had the Solar
Guard officer safely inside the air-lock chamber and had
removed his space helmet and suit. His eyes were
closed, and his face was deathly white. Tom immediately
clapped an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose,
while Roger applied heating units to the wrists and
neck.</p>

<p>Astro burst into the chamber, followed by the professor.
"Will he be all right?" Hemmingwell asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Think nothing of it, Professor Hummingbird," said
Roger. "The old major will come around any second,
and when he does, stand back. The first thing he'll do is
yell."</p>

<p>"Roger, the name is Hemmingwell," hissed Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah, sure," nodded Roger, and then turned to
Astro. "Is Barret still locked up?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," replied the Venusian. "And I hid the key, so
Connel can't get to him until he cools off."</p>

<p>"The major is coming around," said Tom.</p>

<p>As they watched, Connel stirred, coughed several
times, and then opened his eyes. He stared in amazement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
at Tom, then turned to blink unbelievingly at
Roger and Astro. "What in the star-blazing&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It's us all right, sir!" Tom assured him.</p>

<p>"Yeah," chimed in Roger. "And you're not in heaven
or&mdash;er&mdash;any place else either."</p>

<p>As Connel suddenly flushed with anger and sat up,
Hemmingwell spoke quickly. "They saved your life,
Major," he said.</p>

<p>"They did?" Connel's face clouded in confusion. "I
don't understand. How did you three get aboard, anyway?"</p>

<p>"It's a long story, sir," said Tom. "Right now, maybe
we'd better&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before the cadet could finish, there was a loud crashing
and a series of jolting bumps as the ship lurched.</p>

<p>"What the blue blazes!" roared Connel, jumping to
his feet in alarm.</p>

<p>"The projectiles!" exclaimed Roger. "We've got to get
out of here!"</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" cried Astro. "I forgot all
about them!"</p>

<p>Tom, Roger, Astro, Hemmingwell, and Connel raced
out of the air lock to their stations. Astro poured on the
power without waiting for an order from the control
deck and soon they were rocketing into the safety of
space.</p>

<p>Watching the wildly flying missiles on the teleceiver
screen, Connel breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Wow!" he snorted. "Glad we're out of that mess."</p>

<p>"But what are we going to do about them, sir," asked
Tom, a worried frown wrinkling his forehead as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
watched the screen. "We can't just leave those things
there. Some other ship may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it," Connel broke in brusquely.
"The projectiles will run out of fuel in a few minutes
and they'll just drift. They can be fished out any time."</p>

<p>"We can go back and get them ourselves," said the
young cadet eagerly. "Roger and I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've got more important things to do now!" thundered
Connel. Switching on the intercom, he ordered
Roger and Astro to report to the control deck. They appeared
within seconds of his order and he faced the
three cadets grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," he asked, "what's the story?"</p>

<p>"I guess we'd better explain, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better," nodded Connel.</p>

<p>Tom quickly ran over the chain of events, beginning
with his abduction on Mars to their appearance on the
ship, including the part Barret had played in tricking
Roger and Astro into taking the scout. As he spoke,
Connel looked more and more amazed, and when Tom
finally uttered the name of the man he thought was responsible
for all the sabotage, Connel jumped out of his
chair.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You were nearly killed a few minutes ago, sir," said
Tom. "And who sabotaged the rings? Barret! Who was
around every time something happened? Who incited
the crew to keep from taking this ship into space? Who
spread the rumor that it was jinxed? The answer to
every one of those questions, sir, is Barret. And Dave
Barret is working for&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me at that sniveling space pup!" interrupted
Connel, snarling his rage. "I'll tear him apart and throw
him to the buzzards!"</p>

<p>The enraged major jumped to the hatch but Astro
and Tom barred his way, with Roger stepping quickly
in back of him, a heavy wrench in his hand, ready to
assist in any manner necessary to subdue the howling
officer.</p>

<p>"Try to kill me!" Connel howled. "Why, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Major!" shouted Tom. "He's the only one that
can help us convict Carter Devers!"</p>

<p>Connel stopped. He stared at Astro's bulk and then
turned to see Roger trying to hide the wrench. "Were
you going to hit me with that thing, Manning?" he
growled.</p>

<p>Roger gulped. "Yes, sir," he said. "If it was necessary
to keep you away from Barret, sir. I'm sorry, sir."</p>

<p>Connel spun back to face Tom. "Corbett, you must
have a plan," he said. "Let's have it quick."</p>

<p>Tom grinned. "All right, sir," he began. Suddenly, out
of the corner of his eyes, he saw Professor Hemmingwell
slump to the deck.</p>

<p>Hurriedly they picked up the old man and eased him
gently to the nearby acceleration couch. After gulping
some water that Roger poured for him, the old man
smiled weakly. "I'm afraid I don't have the strength to
withstand all this excitement," he said. "But now I understand
why things were never easy for me. Carter
Devers&mdash;he did this to me. He blocked the proposals
every time that they were submitted to the Solar delegations.
He&mdash;" Hemmingwell's head fell back. Roger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
had put a sedative into the water and the old man was
now unconscious.</p>

<p>"It's just fatigue," said Connel. "He'll be all right in a
little while." He turned to Tom. "All right, Corbett,
carry on!"</p>

<p>Tom hurriedly concluded his story of the events leading
up to their startling appearance on the ship, and as
he spoke, he saw the major's frown change to a glowing
grin. When Tom finished, Connel suddenly extended
his hand in a gesture of friendship.</p>

<p>"I have to admit it, Corbett," he said. "You've done
a good job. And," he added with a twinkle in his eye,
"by going along with you, I am an accomplice with
Captain Strong in the aiding of three fugitives from the
Solar Guard."</p>

<p>Tom, Astro, and Roger grinned. "Now, let's get Barret
up here and ask him a few questions," continued
Connel. "And, Manning, if I can't restrain myself, you
have my permission to hit me with that wrench! But so
help me, if you belt me before the time comes, I'll bend
that wrench over your skull!"</p>

<p>While Astro and Roger went below to get Barret,
Connel and Tom reviewed their plan.</p>

<p>"Better keep the news quiet for a while," said Connel.
"If we telecast it back to the Academy, Devers might
get wise."</p>

<p>"Good idea, sir," acknowledged Tom.</p>

<p>"But I can't understand Devers' motive," said Connel.
"What does he stand to gain if this project is a
failure?"</p>

<p>"He'll lose plenty if it's a success," Tom asserted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Devers owns Jilolo Spaceways, the parent company of
Universal Jet Trucking and Surface Transportation! If
the projectiles worked, surface cargo delivery would be
wiped out."</p>

<p>Before Connel could comment on Tom's startling revelation,
they heard the sound of angry voices just outside
the control-deck hatch.</p>

<p>"That must be Astro and Roger bringing in Barret,"
said Tom with a grin.</p>

<p>The hatch clanked open and Astro appeared, carrying
Roger under one arm and Barret under the other.
He dropped them both unceremoniously on the deck,
but when they jumped to their feet, Roger charged forward
quickly and landed a stinging right to Barret's
jaw. The man dropped to the deck again like a stone.</p>

<p>"Manning!" roared Connel. "What was the idea?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to make sure I got in my licks before the
Solar Guard got hold of him," replied Roger, rubbing
his knuckles and looking down at Barret's inert form.</p>

<p>Astro grinned sheepishly. "I tried to stop him, sir!"
he said.</p>

<p>"I'll just bet you tried to stop him!" bellowed Connel.
"Cadet Manning, you put that man to sleep, now you
wake him up!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Roger, and while Connel, Astro, and
Tom roared with laughter, he poured an entire bottle
of water on Barret's face.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_19" id="CHAPTER_19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>


<p>"I don't know what you're talking about!"</p>

<p>Shouting angrily, Barret sat in one of the pilot's
chairs, flanked by Roger and Astro, while Connel and
Tom stood in front of him firing questions.</p>

<p>"Barret," said Connel, "I have enough evidence on
you now to send you to a prison asteroid for ten years
at least!"</p>

<p>"On what charge?" demanded the young man.</p>

<p>"Trying to kill an officer of the Solar Guard."</p>

<p>"Where is your proof?" demanded Barret.</p>

<p>"Right there!" snorted Major Connel, pointing to the
sleeping figure of Professor Hemmingwell.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Barret.</p>

<p>"He'll swear that you deliberately sent this ship into
full drive while I was out on the hull checking the
rings."</p>

<p>"He can't," protested Barret. "He was on the bridge!
He couldn't have seen a thing!"</p>

<p>Tom shook his head gently. "Barret, after what you've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
done to his ship and the projectile operation," he said,
"Hemmingwell will swear to anything."</p>

<p>"It's a frame-up!" shouted Barret.</p>

<p>"And what do you think you did to us?" snarled
Roger.</p>

<p>Barret flushed and turned away. "You can't scare
me," he muttered. "Go ahead. Let him swear to whatever
he wants."</p>

<p>Connel stepped back grimly and turned to Astro and
Roger. "All right, boys," he said. "Take him below and
see if you can't get some different answers out of him."
The hardened spaceman turned his back and walked
to the viewport.</p>

<p>"Why, you dirty space rat!" screamed Barret. "You
wouldn't dare!"</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't he!" retorted Roger. "Listen, pal, he
figures we owe you plenty for what you did to us, and
he's just giving us a chance to pay you back!" He faced
Barret grimly. "Mister, you're going to get the works!
Come on, Astro!"</p>

<p>As the giant Venusian advanced on Barret, the man
shrank back in his chair, eyes widening in sudden fear.
When Astro stretched out his huge hand and grabbed
him by the front of his jacket, he screamed in fright.</p>

<p>"All right, all right!" he cried out. "I'll talk! Devers
did it! He made me do it! He's responsible for the whole
thing!"</p>

<p>"Turn on that audiograph, Corbett!" shouted Connel.</p>

<p>Tom snapped on the machine and brought the microphone
over to Barret, holding it in front of his trembling
mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, talk!" Connel growled. "And tell it all."</p>

<p>Barret had hardly uttered the first stumbling words
when Roger let out a shout of alarm. "Hey! The scanner!"
he cried.</p>

<p>They all turned to the teleceiver screen. To their horror,
they saw a menacing shape blasting toward them.
They recognized it instantly&mdash;a space torpedo!</p>

<p>Astro dove through the power-deck hatch while
Roger raced for the radar-bridge ladder. Tom hurled
himself into the copilot's chair, and with Connel beside
him in the command position, he waited for Astro to
supply power. Suddenly the ship trembled violently and
then shot forward as, far below, the jet exhausts
screamed under the full thrust of all the atomic reactors.
Tom rode the controls hard and kept his eye on the
scanner screen.</p>

<p>"It's a magnetic gyrofish!" he cried as he saw the
torpedo curve after them. "Roger, can you plot her
for me?"</p>

<p>"Working on it now, Tom!" yelled Roger over the
intercom.</p>

<p>"How in blazes did that thing get out here?" muttered
Connel.</p>

<p>"We'll have to worry about that later, I'm afraid, sir,"
replied Tom. "We're going to have our hands full getting
away from her. With that magnetic warhead, she'll
follow us all over space unless we can throw her off."</p>

<p>"Which will take some doing!" grunted Connel,
frowning in deep concern.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom!" Roger's voice called over the intercom.
"It's blasting on maximum thrust now. We have a pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
good chance. Use that idea we worked out. Make a series
of left turns and always on the up-plane of the
ecliptic!"</p>

<p>"Right!" said Tom, clutching the master manual-control
lever and beginning to fly the giant ship through
space by "feel."</p>

<p>"What in blazes are you doing, Corbett?" shouted
Connel in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>"Just hang on and watch, sir," replied Tom, keeping
his eyes on the scanner where he could see the space
torpedo trailing them. Over and over, Tom kept slamming
the ship into sharp left turns, while the torpedo
followed in an ever-narrowing circle.</p>

<p>"All right, Tom!" yelled Roger again. "Give it the
same thing on the right and the down-plane of the
ecliptic!"</p>

<p>"Check!" answered Tom, reversing his controls and
sending the ship corkscrewing through space on an opposite
course.</p>

<p>Connel grabbed the arms of his chair and gasped,
"You kids are space happy!"</p>

<p>"Those gyros are so perfect, sir," said Tom, working
the controls quickly and smoothly, "that the only way
you can throw them off balance is to confuse them."</p>

<p>"Confuse them!" exclaimed Connel.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom. "It's a theory Roger and I worked
out together. No gyro is perfect, and if you can get it
bouncing back and forth in extreme turns, it will be
thrown out of balance. Then all we have to do is make
the torpedo miss once and it won't come back."</p>

<p>"Heaven help us all!" was Connel's groaning reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the ball, Tom!" cried Roger. "She's closing in
on us!"</p>

<p>"I see her," replied Tom calmly. "Hang on, everybody.
I'm going to turn this ship inside out!"</p>

<p>Jerking the controls, Tom threw the ship into a mad,
whirling spin, subjecting the vessel to the most severe
strain tests it would ever undergo. The hull groaned
and creaked, and badly fitted equipment tore loose and
clattered across the deck. Suddenly the young cadet
leveled the ship.</p>

<p>"Nose braking rockets, Astro!" he called.</p>

<p>"Braking rockets, aye!" acknowledged the Venusian
over the intercom.</p>

<p>On the power deck, Astro jammed the forward drive
closed and slammed open the nose rockets. The ship
trembled, bucked, and finally came to a shuddering
stop before it started a reverse course, accelerating
quickly.</p>

<p>"Here it comes!" yelled Roger.</p>

<p>As Connel and Tom watched tensely, the space torpedo
loomed large and menacing on the scanner, and
then, as they held their breaths, it whistled past the
silvery hull of the ship, with less than two feet to spare!</p>

<p>Sighing deeply, Tom brought the ship back to level
flight. "We're O.K. now, sir," he said. "Her gyros are
out. She won't come back."</p>

<p>"By the craters of Luna!" Connel suddenly exploded.
"The Solar Guard spends a fortune to develop a foolproof
space torpedo and two hot-shot cadets come along
and get away from the blasted thing! Why haven't you
told this to anyone before?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;" stammered Tom, "we've never had the
chance to prove it, sir."</p>

<p>Behind them, the power-deck hatch suddenly opened
and Astro stepped in. "Nice work, Tom!" he called.</p>

<p>"And as for you, you Venusian ape," roared Connel,
"don't you realize that you can blow a reactor tube by
throwing so much power into a ship without energizing
the cooling pumps first?"</p>

<p>Astro smiled. "Not if you open the by-pass, sir," he
said, "and feed directly off the pump reservoir. The gas
cools the tube and at the same time expands itself and
adds to the power thrust."</p>

<p>At Astro's easy reply Connel could only stand openmouthed
in amazement. Again, one of the three cadets
of the <i>Polaris</i> unit had developed a revolutionary procedure
that even top rocket scientists would be proud
to call their own.</p>

<p>Winking at Tom, Astro turned away and suddenly
noticed Barret sprawled on the deck, unconscious.</p>

<p>"What happened to him?" asked the big Venusian.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot all about him," said Tom. "Guess he
didn't get into an acceleration chair in time. Better get
some more water."</p>

<p>"We haven't time for him now!" snapped Connel.
"Strap him in good and tight. We've got to find out
where that torpedo came from."</p>

<p>As though in answer to the major's order, there was
a sudden call over the ship's intercom.</p>

<p>"Radar bridge to control deck, check in!" There was
a note of alarm in Roger's voice.</p>

<p>Tom jumped to the control panel to reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Control deck, aye!" he snapped into the microphone.</p>

<p>"There's a spaceship to starboard!" called Roger.
"Distance twenty miles, fifteen degrees up on the plane
of the ecliptic. And I swear she's maneuvering to fire
another torpedo!"</p>

<p>"Stand by action stations!" roared Connel, diving into
his chair before the control panel. Tom strapped in next
to him, while Astro made a headlong dash for the power
deck.</p>

<p>"Yes!" shouted Roger. "She's fired a torpedo!"</p>

<p>"Raise her! Raise her!" bellowed Connel. "Tell them
who we are!" He turned to Tom. "Go into your act,
Corbett," he said, "and make it good!"</p>

<p>As Tom manipulated the controls again, the silver
ship plunged through space, turning and gyrating in
the same series of maneuvers it had performed to
escape the first torpedo. But this time the distance
separating them was not as great and the torpedo closed in
quickly.</p>

<p>"Can't you raise that ship yet, Manning?" Connel
roared into the intercom.</p>

<p>"I just have, sir," replied Roger in a strained voice.
"But it's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me talk to that lame brain of a skipper,"
interrupted Connel. "By the stars, I'll teach him to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's no use, Connel," said a gruff voice over the
control-deck loud-speaker. "Even if you duck this torpedo,
I've got ten more!"</p>

<p>"Who is this?" roared Connel.</p>

<p>"Don't you know, Connel? Why, I'm surprised!"</p>

<p>The teleceiver screen glowed into life and Tom and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Connel stared in horror as they recognized the images
of three men. The one in the foreground smiled mockingly
and said, "Remember me, Connel?"</p>

<p>"Devers!" Connel roared.</p>

<p>"And the other two behind him&mdash;" stuttered Tom.
"Cag and Monty!"</p>

<p>"Why, you dirty space crawler," cried Connel, "I'll
get you if it's the last thing I do!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-209.png" width="500" height="413" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"No, you won't, Major." Devers laughed. "The last
thing you'll do is kiss a space torpedo. Then no more
Major Blast-off Connel, no more whimpering Professor
Hemmingwell, and most important, no more projectile
ship!"</p>

<p>And as Devers laughed loudly, Tom threw the ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
into another violent turn and cried, "It's no use, Major.
I can't duck this one!"</p>

<p>"All hands brace for torpedo!" warned Connel.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an explosion aft. The ship
lurched and shuddered violently, spinning through
space, and as Tom fought the controls, everything went
black. The ship drifted helplessly, out of control.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_20" id="CHAPTER_20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>


<p>"Turn on the lights! Cut in the emergency batteries!"</p>

<p>Connel's bull-throated roar carried through the ship
as he stood on the power deck with Astro and shouted
to Tom on the control deck. The space torpedo had destroyed
the stern of the vessel, and if it hadn't been for
Astro's quick action in sealing off the aftersection of the
ship, all the air might have been lost and the crew dead
of suffocation.</p>

<p>A moment later the emergency lights glowed weakly
and Connel and the big Venusian cadet began a quick
inspection of the ship. The power deck was a total loss.
The ship would never get under way again.</p>

<p>Up on the radar bridge, Roger was about to turn on
the radar scanner when Tom appeared and stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Wait a while, Roger," he said. "We may need the
power for something else."</p>

<p>"What, for instance?" snorted Roger.</p>

<p>"That ship is still out there, probably closing in for
the kill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"A blasted lot we can do about it," Roger growled.</p>

<p>"I've got a plan that might work," said Tom half-heartedly.
"It's about the only thing I can think of, unless
Connel and Astro have a better idea."</p>

<p>"What is it? Whatever it is, it's better than sitting
here like a dead duck, waiting for that rat to come in
and finish us off!" said Roger. "Look, I've just got to see
what he's doing out there." He flipped on the scanner
switch and while he waited for the set to warm up he
turned back to Tom. "What's your idea?"</p>

<p>"Well," began Tom, "the only thing we've got on
board that we can use to fight back with are those projectiles."</p>

<p>"How can we fight with projectiles?" demanded
Roger. "They don't carry warheads!"</p>

<p>"No," agreed Tom. "But they're big and heavy. They
pack a wallop if they hit anything."</p>

<p>Roger's eyes brightened suddenly. "Say, I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>The scanner began to beep and Roger turned his attention
to the screen. Tom leaned over his shoulder and
watched eagerly. They both saw Devers' ship flying in
a slow circle around them.</p>

<p>"Probably looking to see which would be the best
way to let us have it!" snarled Roger.</p>

<p>At that moment Major Connel climbed into the radar
bridge, followed by Astro.</p>

<p>"Time to go," announced the officer.</p>

<p>"Go where?" demanded Roger.</p>

<p>"We have to abandon ship," declared Connel. "The
power deck is shot. We'll never get under way, and
we're just sitting ducks if we stay aboard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's to prevent Devers from picking us off while
we're outside?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Connel. "But he'll have a harder job
and maybe he won't get all of us."</p>

<p>"Then, sir," said Tom with a glance at Roger, "I have
an idea."</p>

<p>"Let's have it," said Connel.</p>

<p>"The projectiles, sir," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"What about them?"</p>

<p>"We can still fire them off the emergency batteries,
sir."</p>

<p>"Will you get to the point, Corbett?" growled Connel.
"Devers is liable to send another torpedo our way any
second and&mdash;" Connel suddenly stopped and his eyes
widened. "A torpedo!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir!" exclaimed Tom. "We have five
projectiles! We can use them as torpedoes!"</p>

<p>"Jumping Jupiter!" exclaimed Astro. "What a terrific
idea!"</p>

<p>"What a terrific pipe dream!" snapped Connel. "Those
projectiles don't have any warheads!"</p>

<p>"They could still do a lot of damage if they hit that
ship," asserted Tom.</p>

<p>"And how do you expect to aim them?" demanded
Connel. "There's not enough juice in the batteries to
steer them!"</p>

<p>"We'll just fire them straight ahead, sir," broke in
Roger. "Look!" he continued, pointing to the scanner
screen. "Devers' ship is just circling us now. And he's
on the same plane of the ecliptic. If he holds that
course&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll cross our bow!" exclaimed Astro excitedly. "A
perfect shot!"</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!" shouted Connel. "Preposterous! It'll
never work in a million light years! He'll fire another
torpedo and we'll be blasted into space dust!"</p>

<p>"But we can try it, can't we, sir?" asked Tom, grinning.</p>

<p>"Of course we can!" roared Connel. "I've never given
up a battle yet and, by the stars, I'm not going to
now!"</p>

<p>Forgetting rank and protocol, the three cadets danced
around the major, slapping him on the back and howling
their enthusiasm. Connel could not restrain a momentary
grin and then his features assumed his usual
bulldog look.</p>

<p>"Knock it off!" he shouted. "We've got work to do.
Manning!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes nailed to that scanner!" Connel bellowed.
"Sing out if Devers changes course by so much
as a hair!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>"Astro!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Put space suits on Professor Hemmingwell and Barret
and stand by with them on the control deck."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>"Corbett, you and I will check the projectiles. Make
sure they're in firing order!"</p>

<p>Spinning on his heel, Connel left the radar bridge.
Alone for just an instant, the three cadets of the <i>Polaris</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
unit clasped hands in silent determination and then
plunged into their various assignments.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Connel and Tom returned to the
control deck to find Astro waiting for them. Professor
Hemmingwell and Barret, both in space suits, were
seated on acceleration couches. As Connel walked up to
him, Hemmingwell raised his head slowly, still under
the effects of the sedative.</p>

<p>"What's&mdash;what's happening, Major?" he asked haltingly.</p>

<p>"Professor," said Connel, "one of two things is going
to happen. Either your ship will be blown to space dust
or Carter Devers will be finished and we'll bring your
ship back to Earth!"</p>

<p>"Good, good," murmured Hemmingwell.</p>

<p>"And as for you, Barret"&mdash;Connel turned toward the
man angrily&mdash;"now you can see what kind of thanks
you get for your dirty work! Your boss is just as willing
to get rid of you as he is to destroy this project!"</p>

<p>Barret flushed under Connel's glare and turned away.</p>

<p>At the control panel, Tom opened the circuits to the
five loaded firing chambers and then turned to Connel.
"All set to fire, sir!" he called.</p>


<p>"Any word from Manning?" asked Connel.</p>

<p>"Not while I've been here," replied Astro.</p>

<p>Connel picked up the intercom microphone. "Hello,
Manning!" he shouted. "What's the story?"</p>

<p>"Coming up to the last chapter," replied Roger over
the intercom. "Devers is holding course. Should cross
our bow in two minutes!"</p>

<p>"Good," replied Connel. "Keep us posted!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Replacing the microphone, he turned to Tom. "Stupid
fool!" he snorted. "He should've fired another torpedo
and wiped us out. What's the matter with him?" Connel
abhorred stupidity, even in an adversary.</p>

<p>"Maybe he thinks we've already had it," suggested
Astro. "With our stern blasted away, he might figure
all the air's gone out of the ship."</p>

<p>"Let's hope he keeps on figuring that way," said
Connel. "Everything ready to fire, Corbett?"</p>

<p>"All set, sir," the young cadet replied. "I've hooked
up all circuits to this button." He pointed to a button
on the control panel. "We'll blast in salvo."</p>

<p>"Oh, we will, will we?" exclaimed Connel.</p>

<p>"If you think it's advisable," Tom amended hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Of course it's advisable!" snorted Connel. "We're almost
aiming blind as it is. A salvo will give us a bigger
spread. Besides," he added, "with a whole barrel of
luck, we might hit him with two of the projectiles. That
would really do some damage."</p>

<p>"I'd like just a little potful of luck," murmured Astro,
"and be able to land one."</p>

<p>"Heads up, down there!" Roger's voice suddenly sang
out on the intercom.</p>

<p>"Devers crossing our bow yet?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"He's still holding course," said Roger. "But he's
training his number one starboard tube this way. He's
going to blast us again!"</p>

<p>"How long do we have to wait for that bow shot?"
demanded Connel.</p>

<p>"Another forty-five seconds at least!" came Roger's
reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blast it!" muttered Connel. "Plenty of time for him
to fire."</p>

<p>Barret suddenly rose from his acceleration couch,
screaming, "You can't keep me here! Let me go!"</p>

<p>Astro grabbed him quickly and threw him back
down. "Stay put," he growled.</p>

<p>"No," cried Barret, frantic with fear. "It's murder!
Let me go!"</p>

<p>"Relax and enjoy it, Barret," snorted Connel. "It's
your boss who's doing it!"</p>

<p>"What about Professor Hemmingwell, sir?" asked
Tom. "Shouldn't we&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No," Hemmingwell spoke up from his daze. "I want
to stay with my ship."</p>

<p>"Hey!" Roger cried over the intercom. "We're getting
company!"</p>

<p>"Company?" exclaimed Tom. "What're you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"A Solar Guard cruiser," replied Roger. "Coming up
to port. About five hundred miles away. Hey! It's the
<i>Polaris</i>!"</p>

<p>"It must be Captain Strong!" shouted Tom.</p>

<p>"He won't do us much good now," muttered Connel.
"How much time do we have, Roger?"</p>

<p>"Get set down there. Only another ten seconds and
Devers will be right on our bow."</p>

<p>"On the ball, Tom!" ordered Connel.</p>

<p>"Ready, sir."</p>

<p>The seconds ticked by slowly. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;Beads
of sweat appeared on Connel's brow.
Astro clenched and unclenched his fists. Hemmingwell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
closed his eyes calmly and waited. Barret slumped back
in his couch, almost paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p>"Coming up, Tom!" cried Roger.</p>

<p>Tom didn't reply. He kept his fingers poised on the
firing button. And the seconds ticked off slowly, maddeningly.
Seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;!</p>

<p>"They've fired," Roger shouted. "Point-blank! We're
going to get it!"</p>

<p>"Fire, Tom!" shouted Connel.</p>

<p>Even as Connel spoke, Tom's finger pressed down
hard on the firing button. The ship quivered as five
projectiles blasted from the firing chambers and winged
their deadly way through space. The control room of
the ship was silent, everyone waiting for the impact of
the torpedo and praying that somehow, someway, they
could know whether their own attack had succeeded
even if they lost their own lives in the attempt to
destroy Devers' ship.</p>

<p>There was a sudden, blasting roar and a brilliant
white flash of light filled the cabin. The deck heaved
violently, then dropped sickeningly. Under the force
of the explosion, everyone was thrown to the deck and
lay deathly still.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the wardroom of the rocket cruiser <i>Polaris</i>, Captain
Strong, Major Connel, Professor Hemmingwell, and
Roger and Astro were sipping tea and calmly discussing
the events of the past hour.</p>

<p>"Your ship wasn't too badly damaged, Professor," said
Strong. "We'll take her in tow and bring her back to
Space Academy. She'll be good as new."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to do without the services of
Dave Barret though, sir," commented Connel dryly.
"He's got a previous engagement on a prison asteroid
and it's going to take him a long time."</p>

<p>"I can do very well without him," said Hemmingwell.
"As a matter of fact, I would have done extremely well
without him before." He paused and shook his head. "I
feel so ashamed of myself when I think of the things I
said to those boys." He nodded toward Astro and Roger.
"And all the time they were right."</p>

<p>Astro grinned shyly. Roger was about to open his
mouth and make a typically flip remark when the hatch
opened and Tom appeared, a bandage covering his
head. The two cadets jumped toward him and snowed
him under with affectionate slaps on the back.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" cried Tom. "I'm injured. Look at
my head!"</p>

<p>"You couldn't have hit the control panel with
anything better!" snorted Connel.</p>

<p>"But what happened?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Two of the projectiles hit Devers' ship," said Roger.
"One of them on the power deck. Must've smashed the
reaction tanks and made the stuff wildcat, because it
blew him into rocket dust!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">

<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Picture originally on page 209; moved to correspond to text.">Note</ins></div>

<p>"But his torpedo! He fired at the same time!" said
Tom.</p>

<p>"This unit is the luckiest in the universe," said Roger
proudly. "One of the other projectiles smacked the torpedo
and exploded the warhead. We were bounced
around by the shock wave but that's all!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'll be a Martian mouse," sighed Tom. "Then
everything is O.K. now?"</p>

<p>"So far as you three are concerned, it's perfect," said
Strong. "Barret has spilled everything. You're cleared
of all charges!"</p>

<p>"What about Pat Troy?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"He's in the clear, too," said Strong. "You may remember
that he refused to tell us who he was working
for besides Professor Hemmingwell and that made us
suspicious of him. Well, we found out, when he regained
consciousness a short time ago, that he is a
security agent for the Solar Alliance Council. He had
been assigned to work with the professor and to help
protect him. Barret has admitted that he tried to murder
Troy."</p>

<p>"Humph!" snorted Connel, suddenly rising.</p>

<p>The room was intensely quiet and Tom, Astro, and
Roger felt that there was something coming. Strong
could hardly suppress a grin as Connel took a paper
from his tunic.</p>

<p>"This message was received just fifteen minutes ago,"
he said. "It reads, quote, Major Connel, Solar Guard.
With reference to Operation Space Projectile, information
has come to us that the Space Cadet unit, known
as the <i>Polaris</i> unit, has contributed in an outstanding
and extraordinary way to the successful completion of
this highly valuable project. As Senior Line Officer of
the Academy, it is hereby requested that you bestow
upon this unit some form of expression of the gratitude
of this Council for their remarkable and inspired behavior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in the face of relentless odds. Signed, Secretary
General, Solar Council, Venusport, Venus. Fourteenth
of June, 2354, end quote."</p>

<p>Connel slipped the paper inside his tunic and faced
the three cadets.</p>

<p>"All right, you heard it!" he growled. "And you deserve
it. You have three weeks' leave. But when you
come back," he added, "watch out!"</p>

<p>"Oh, for the life of a Space Cadet!" said Tom, grinning
at his unit mates. "It's wonderful!"</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
