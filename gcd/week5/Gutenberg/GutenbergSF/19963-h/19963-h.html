<div class="block tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The enlightened days of mental telepathy and
ESP should have made the world a better place,
But the minute the Rhine Institute opened up, all
the crooks decided it was time to go collegiate!</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Someone behind me in the
dark was toting a needle-ray. The
impression came through so
strong that I could almost read
the filed-off serial number of the
thing, but the guy himself I
couldn't dig at all. I stopped to
look back but the only sign of
life I could see was the fast flick
of taxicab lights as they crossed
an intersection about a half mile
back. I stepped into a doorway so
that I could think and stay out of
the line of fire at the same time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The impression of the needle-ray
did not get any stronger, and
that tipped me off. The bird was
following me. He was no peace-loving
citizen because honest men
do not cart weapons with the
serial numbers filed off. Therefore
the character tailing me was
a hot papa with a burner charge
labelled "Steve Hammond" in his
needler.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I concentrated, but the only
impression I could get would
have specified ninety-eight men<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out of a hundred anywhere. He
was shorter than my six-feet-two
and lighter than my one-ninety.
I could guess that he was better
looking. I'd had my features arranged
by a blocked drop kick
the year before the National
Football League ruled the Rhine
Institute out because of our use
of mentals and perceptives. I
gave up trying--I wanted details
and not an overall picture of a
hotbird carrying a burner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I wondered if I could make a
run for it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I let my sense of perception
dig the street ahead, casing
every bump and irregularity. I
passed places where I could zig
out to take cover in front of telephone
poles, and other places
where I could zag in to take
cover beyond front steps and the
like. I let my perception run up
the block and by the time I got
to the end of my range, I knew
that block just as well as if I'd
made a practise run in the daytime.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point I got a shock.
The hot papa was coming up the
sidewalk hell bent for destruction.
He was a mental sensitive,
and he had been following my
thoughts while my sense of perception
made its trial run up the
street. He was running like the
devil to catch up with my mind
and burn it down per schedule. It
must have come as quite a shock
to him when he realized that
while the mind he was reading
was running like hell up the
street, the hard old body was
standing in the doorway waiting
for him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I dove out of my hiding place
as he came close. I wanted to
tackle him hard and ask some
pointed questions. He saw me as
I saw him skidding to an unbalanced
stop, and there was the
dull glint of metal in his right
hand. His needle-ray came
swinging up and I went for my
armpit. I found time to curse my
own stupidity for not having
hardware in my own fist at the
moment. But then I had my rod
in my fist. I felt the hot scorch
of the needle going off just over
my shoulder, and then came the
godawful racket of my ancient
forty-five. The big slug caught
him high in the belly and tossed
him back. It folded him over and
dropped him in the gutter while
the echoes of my cannon were
still racketing back and forth up
and down the quiet street.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had just enough time to dig
his wallet, pockets, and billfold
before the whole neighborhood
was up and out. Sirens howled in
the distance and from above I
could hear the thin wail of a jetcopter.
Someone opened a window
and called: "What's going
on out there? Cut it out!"</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/image01.png" width="640" height="930" alt="Illustration" /></div>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Tea party," I called back. "Go
invite the cops, Tommy."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The window slammed down
again. He didn't have to invite
the law. It arrived in three
ground cruisers and two jetcopter
emergency squads that
came closing in like a collapsing
balloon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The leader of the squadron
was a Lieutenant Williamson
whom I'd never met before. But
he knew all about me before the
'copter hit the ground. I could
almost feel his sense of perception
frisking me from the skin
outward, going through my wallet
and inspecting the Private
Operator's license and my Weapon-Permit.
I found out later
that Williamson was a Rhine
Scholar with a Bachelor's Degree
in Perception, which put him
head and shoulders over me. He
came to the point at once.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Any ideas about this, Hammond?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I shook my head. "Nope," I replied.
He looked at one of his
men.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other man nodded. "He's
levelling," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Now look, Hammond," said
the lieutenant pointedly, "You're
clean and we know it. But hot
papas don't go out for fun. Why
was he trying to burn you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I wouldn't know. I'm as blank
as any perceptive when it comes
to reading minds. I was hoping
to collect him whole enough to
ask questions, but he forced my
hand." I looked to where some of
the clean-up squad were tucking
the corpse into a basket. "It was
one of the few times I'd have
happily swapped my perception
for the ability to read a mind."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lieutenant nodded unhappily.
"Mind telling me why you
were wandering around in this
neighborhood? You don't belong
here, you know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I was doing the job that most
private eyes do. I was tailing a
gent who was playing games off
the reservation."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"You've gone into this guy's
wallet, of course?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I nodded. "Sure. He <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span> Peter
Rambaugh, age thirty, and----"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Don't bother. I know the rest.
I can add only one item that you
may not know. Rampaugh was
a paid hotboy, suspected of playing
with Scarmann's mob."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I've had no dealings with
Scarmann, Lieutenant."</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lieutenant nodded absently.
It seemed to be a habit with
him, probably to cover up his
thinking-time. Finally he said,
"Hammond, you're clean. As soon
as I identified you I took a dig
of your folder at headquarters.
You're a bit rough and fast on
that prehistoric cannon of yours,
but----"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"You mean you can dig a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
folder at central files all the way
from here?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I did."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here was a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></span> esper for you.
I've got a range of about two
blocks for good, solid, permanent
things like buildings and street-car
tracks, but unfamiliar things
get foggy at about a half a block.
I can dig lethal machinery coming
in my direction for about a
block and a half because I'm a bit
sensitive about such things. I
looked at Lieutenant Williamson
and said, "With a range like
yours, how come there's any
crime in this town at all?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He shook his head slowly.
"Crime doesn't out until it's committed,"
he said. "You'll remember
how fast we got here after
you pulled the trigger. But you're
clean, Hammond. Just come to
the inquest and tell all."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I can go?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"You can go. But just to keep
you out of any more trouble, I'll
have one of the jetcopters drop
you off at home. Mind?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Nope. But isn't that more
than the police are used to
doing?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He eyed me amusedly. "If I
were a mental," he said, "I could
read your mind and know that
you were forming the notion of
calling on Scarmann and asking
him what-for. But since I'm only
a mind-blank esper, all I can do
is to fall back on experience and
guesswork. Do I make myself
clear?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lieutenant Williamson's guess-work
and experience were us
good as mental sensitivity, but I
didn't think it wise to admit that
I had been considering just exactly
how to get to Scarmann. I
was quickly and firmly convoyed
home in a jetcopter but once I
saw them take off I walked out
of the apartment again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had more or less tacitly
agreed not to go looking for
Scarmann, but I had not mentioned
taking a dig at the apartment
of the dear departed, Peter
Rambaugh.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rambaugh's place was uptown
and the front door was protected
by an eight tumbler cylinder job
that would have taxed the best
of esper lockpicks. But there was
a service entrance in back that
was not locked and I took it. The
elevator was a self-service job,
and Rambaugh's back door was
locked on a snaplatch that a
playful kitten could have opened.
I dug the place for a few minutes
and found it clean, so I went in
and took a more careful look.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The desk was not particularly
interesting. Just papers and letters
and unpaid bills. The dresser
in the bedroom was the same, excepting
for the bottom drawer.
That was filled with a fine collection
of needle-rays and stunguns<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and one big force blaster that
could blow a hole in a brick wall.
None of them had their serial
numbers intact.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But behind a reproduction of
a Gainsborough painting was a
wall safe that must have been
built before Rhine Institute discovered
the key to man's latent
abilities. Inside of this tin can
was a collection of photographs
that must have brought Rambaugh
a nice sum in the months
when the murder business went
slack. I couldn't quite dig them
clear because I didn't know any
of the people involved, and I
didn't try too hard because there
were some letters and notes that
might lead me into the answer to
why Rambaugh was hotburning
for me.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I fiddled with the dial for
about fifteen minutes, watching
the tumblers and the little wheels
go around. Then it went click and
I turned the handle and opened
the door. I was standing there
with both hands deep in Rambaugh's
safe when I heard a
noise behind me.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I whirled and slid aside all in
one motion and my hand streaked
for my armpit and came out with
the forty five. It was a woman
and she was carrying nothing
more lethal than the fountain
pen in her purse. She blanched
when she saw my forty-five
swinging towards her middle,
but she took a deep breath when
I halted it in midair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I didn't mean to startle you,"
she apologized.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Startle, hell!" I blurted. "You
scared me out of my shoes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I dug her purse. Beside the
usual female junk she had a
wallet containing a couple of
charge-account plates, a driver's
license, and a hospital card, all
made out to Miss Martha Franklin.
Miss Franklin was about
twenty-four, and she was a
strawberry blonde with the pale
skin and blue eyes that goes with
the hair. I gathered that she
didn't belong there any more
than I did.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I don't, Mr. Hammond," she
said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Martha Franklin was a
mental sensitive.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I am," she told me. "That's
how I came to be here."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I'm esper. You'll have to explain
in words of one syllable because
I can't read you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I was not far away when you
cut loose with that field-piece of
yours," she said flatly. "So I read
your intention to come here. I've
been following you at mental
range ever since."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Why?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Because there is something in
that safe I want very much."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I looked at her again. She did
not look the type to get into awkward<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
situations. She colored
slightly and said, "One indiscretion
doesn't make a tramp,
Mr. Hammond."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I nodded. "Want it intact or
burned?" I asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Burned, please," she said,
smiling weakly at me for my intention.
I smiled back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On my way to Rambaugh's
bedroom I dug the rest of the
thug's safe but there wasn't anything
there that would give me
an inkling of why he was gunning
for me. I came back with
one of his needle-rays and burned
the contents of the safe to a
black char. I stirred up the ashes
with the nose of the needier and
then left it in the safe after
wiping it clean on my handkerchief.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Thank you, Mr. Hammond,"
she said quietly. "Maybe I can
answer your question. Rambaugh
was probably after you because
of me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Huh?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I've been paying Rambaugh
blackmail for about four years.
This morning I decided to stop
it, and looked your name up in
the telephone book. Rambaugh
must have read me do it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Ever think of the police?" I
suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Of course. But that is just as
bad as not paying off. You end
up all over the front pages anyway.
You know that."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"There's a lot of argument on
both sides," I supposed. "But
let's finish this one over a bar.
We're crowding our luck here. In
the eyes of the law we're just a
couple of nasty break-ins."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Yes," she said simply.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We left Rambaugh's apartment
together and I handed
Martha into my car and took off.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It struck me as we were driving
that mental sensitivity was a
good thing in spite of its limitations.
A woman without mental
training might have every right
to object to visiting a bachelor
apartment at two o'clock in the
morning. But I had no firm plans
for playing up to Martha Franklin;
I really wanted to talk this
mess out and get it squared
away. This she could read, so I
was saved the almost-impossible
task of trying to convince an attractive
woman that I really had
no designs upon her beautiful
white body. I was not at all cold
to the idea, but Martha did not
seem to be the pushover type.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Thank you, Steve," she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Thanks for nothing," I told
her with a short laugh. "Them's
my sentiments."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I like your sentiments. That's
why I'm here, and maybe we
can get our heads together and
figure something out."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I nodded and went back to my
driving, feeling pretty good now.</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A man does not dig his own
apartment. He expects to find it
the way he left it. He digs in
the mailbox on his way towards
it, and he may dig in his refrigerator
to see whether he should
stop for beer or whatever else,
because these things save steps.
But nobody really expects to find
trouble in his own home, especially
when he is coming in at
three o'clock in the morning with
a good looking woman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were smart enough to
come with nothing deadly in
their hands. So I had no warning
until they stepped out from
either side of my front door and
lifted me into my living room by
the elbows. They hurled me into
an easy chair with a crash. When
I stopped bouncing, one of the
gorillas was standing in front
of me, about as tall as Washington
Monument as seen from the
sidewalk in front. He was looking
at my forty-five with careful curiosity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"What gives?" I demanded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The crumb in front of me
leaned down and gave me a back-and-forth
that yanked my head
around. I didn't say anything,
but I thought how I'd like to
meet the buzzard in a dark alley
with my gun in my fist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martha said, "They're friends
of Rambaugh, Steve. And they're
a little afraid of that prehistoric
cannon you carry."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bird in front of Martha
gave her a one-two across the
face. That was enough for me. I
came up out of my chair, lifting
my fist from the floor and putting
my back and thigh muscles
behind it. It should have taken
his head off, but all he did was
grunt, stagger back, dig his heels
in, and then come back at me
with his head down. I chopped
at the bridge of his nose but
missed and almost broke my
hand on his hard skull. Then the
other guy came charging in and
I flung out a side-chop with my
other hand and caught him on
the wrist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Rhine training can't do
away with the old fact that two
big tough men can wipe the floor
with one big tough man. I didn't
even take long enough to muss
up my furniture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had the satisfaction of mashing
a nose and cracking my hand
against a skull again before the
lights went out. When I came
back from Mars, I was sitting
on a kitchen chair facing a corner.
My wrists and ankles were
taped to the arms and legs of the
chair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I dug around. They had
Martha taped to another chair
in the opposite corner, and the
two gorillas were standing in
the middle of the room, obviously
trying to think.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So was I. There was something<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that smelled about this mess.
Peter Rambaugh was a mental,
and he should have been sensitive
enough to keep his take low
enough so that it wouldn't drive
Martha into thinking up ways
and means of getting rid of him.
Even so, he shouldn't have been
gunning for me, unless there was
a lot more to this than I could
dig.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"What gives?" I asked sourly.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was no answer. The
thug with my forty-five took out
the clip and removed a couple of
slugs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He went into the kitchen
and found my pliers and came
back teasing one of the slugs out
of its casing. The other bird lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bird with the cartridge
poured the powder from the shell
into the palm of my hand. I knew
what was coming but I couldn't
wiggle my fingers much, let alone
turn my hand over to dump out
the stuff. The other guy planted
the end of the cigarette between
my middle fingers and I had to
squeeze hard to keep the hot end
up. My fingers began to ache almost
immediately, and I was beginning
to imagine the flash of
flame and the fierce wave of pain
that would strike when my tired
hand lost its pep and let the cigarette
fall into that little mound
of powder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Stop it," said Martha. "Stop
it!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"What do they want?" I
gritted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"They won't think it," she
cried.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bright red on the end of
the cigarette grayed with ash
and I began to wonder how long
it would be before a fleck of hot
ash would fall. How long it would
take for the ash to grow long and
top-heavy and then to fall into
the powder. And whether or not
the ash would be hot enough to
touch it off. I struggled to keep
my hands steady, but they were
trembling. I felt the cigarette
slip a bit and clamped down tight
again with my aching fingers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martha pleaded again: "Stop
it! Let us know what you want
and we'll do it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Anything," I promised
rashly.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even if I managed to hold
that deadly fuse tight, it would
eventually burn down to the
bitter end. Then there would be
a flash, and I'd probably never
hold my hand around a gun butt
again. I'd have to go looking for
this pair of lice with my gun in
my left. If they didn't try the
same trick on my other hand. I
tried to shut my mind on that
notion but it was no use. It
slipped. But the chances were
that this pair of close-mouthed<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hotboys had considered that idea
before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Can you dig 'em Martha?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Yes, but not deep enough.
They're both concentrating on
that cigarette and making mental
bets when it will--"</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her voice trailed off. A wisp of
ash had dropped and my mental
howl must have been loud enough
to scorch their minds. It was
enough to stop Martha, at any
rate. But the wisp of ash was
cold and nothing happened except
my spine got coldly wet and
sweat ran down my face and into
my mouth. The palm of my hand
was sweating too, but not enough
to wet the little pile of powder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Look," I said in a voice that
sounded like a nutmeg grater,
"Rambaugh was a louse and he
tried to kill me first. If it's revenge
you want--why not let's
talk it over?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"They don't care what you did
to Rambaugh," said Martha.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"They didn't come here to
practice torture," I snapped.
"They want something big. And
the only guy I know mixed up
with Peter Rambaugh is Scarmann,
himself."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Scarmann?" blurted Martha.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scarmann was a big shot who
lived in a palace about as lush as
the Taj Mahal, in the middle of
a fenced-in property big enough
to keep him out of the mental
range of most peepers. Scarmann
was about as big a louse as they
came but nobody could put a
finger on him because he managed
to keep himself as clean as
a raygunned needle. I was expecting
a clip on the skull for
thinking the things I was thinking
about Scarmann, but it did
not come. These guys were used
to having people think violence
at their boss. I thought a little
harder. Maybe if I made 'em
mad enough one of them would
belt me on the noggin and put me
out, and then I'd be cold when
that cigarette fell into the gunpowder
and ruined my hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I made myself a firm, solid
promise that if, as, and when I
got out of this fix I would find
Scarmann, shove the nose of my
automatic down his throat
through his front teeth and
empty the clip out through the
top of his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the hotboy behind me
lifted the cigarette from my
fingers very gently and squibbed
it out in the ashtray, and I got
the pitch.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the way it is done in
these enlightened days. Rhine Institute
and the special talents
that Rhine developed should and
could have made the world a
better, brighter place to live in.
But I've heard it said and had it
proved that the minute someone<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
comes up with something good,
there are a lot of buzzards who
turn it bad and make it a foul,
rotten medium for their lousy
way of life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No, in these days of mental
telepathy and extra sensory perception,
crumbs do not erase
other crumbs. They just grab
some citizen and put him in a
box until he is ready to do their
dirty work for them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Guilt? That would be mine. A
crime is a crime and the guy who
does it is a criminal, no matter
how he justifies his act of violence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The truth? Any court mentalist
who waded through that pair
of unwashed minds would find
no evidence of any open deal with
Steve Hammond. Sure, he would
find violence there, but the Court
is more than well aware of the
fact that thinking of an act of
violence is not illegal. This Rhine
training has been too recent to
get the human race trained into
the niceties of polite mental behavior.
Sure, they'd get a few
months or maybe a few years for
breaking and entering as well as
assault, but after all, they were
friends of Rambaugh and this
might well be a matter of retaliation,
even though they thought
Rambaugh was an incompetent
bungler.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So if Steve Hammond believed
that he could go free with a
whole hand by planning to rub
out a man named Scarmann, that
would be Steve Hammond's
crime, not theirs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They didn't take any chances,
even though I knew that they
could read my mind well enough
to know that I would go through
with their nasty little scheme.
They hustled Martha into the
kitchen, chair and all, and one of
them stood there with my paring
knife touching her soft throat
enough to indent the skin but not
enough to draw blood. The other
rat untaped me and stood me on
my feet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I hurt all over from the pasting
I'd taken, so I took a boiling
shower and dressed leisurely.
The guy handed me my forty-five,
all loaded, as I came out of
the bathroom. The other bird
hadn't moved a muscle out in the
kitchen. His knife was still
pressing against Martha's
throat. He was still standing pat
when I passed out of esper range
on the street below.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In pre-Rhine days, a citizen in
my pinch would holler for the
cops because he couldn't be sure
that the crooks would keep their
end of the bargain. But Rhine
training has produced a real
"Honor Among Thieves" so that
organized crime can run as fast
as organized justice. If I kept my
end and they didn't keep theirs,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the word would get around from
their own dirty minds that they
couldn't keep a bargain. Well, I
was going to keep mine for the
same reason, even though I am
not a thief.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That's the way it's done these
days. You get a good esper like
me to knock off a sharp mental
operator like Scarmann.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The trouble was that I didn't
really want Scarmann, I wanted
that pair of mental sadists up in
my apartment who were holding
a knife against Martha's throat.
I wanted them, and I wanted
Martha Franklin's skin to be
happily whole. And if I crossed
them now, the only guys that
wouldn't play ball with me in the
future would be the crooks.
Them I could do without.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So if they figured that an
esper could take a mental like
Scarmann, why couldn't an esper
take the pair of them?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All I had to do was to think of
something else until I could get
my hands on their throats. Sure,
they'd follow my mind as soon
as they felt my mental waves
within range, but if I could
really find something interesting
enough to occupy my attention--and
maybe theirs as well--they
could not identify me.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So I went back into the lobby
of my apartment and dug into
the mailbox of another party,
thus identifying myself as the
man in three eight four. Then
I punched the elevator button for
the Fourth and leaned back
against the elevator and let my
mind wander up through the
apartments above.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I violated all the laws against
Esping Toms as the elevator
oozed upwards. Eventually my
sense of perception wandered
through my own apartment and
I located her lying on the bed,
fully dressed. She'd probably
been freed lest some esper cop
get to wondering why there was
a woman taped to a chair in a
bachelor's kitchen. I shut my
mind like a clam, but I couldn't
withdraw my perception too fast.
I let it ooze back there like the
eyes of a lecherous old man at a
burleycue.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I left the elevator at the
Fourth and walked up the stairs
by reflex, while my mind was
positively radiating waves of vulgarity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My mind managed to identify
her as "The girl on the bed"
without thinking any name. She
was a good looking strawberry
blonde with a slender waist and
a high bosom and long, slender
legs. She was wearing a pair of
Dornier shoes with three inch
heels that did things to her
ankles. Her nylons were size
eight and one half, medium
length, in that dark shade that<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
always gives me ideas. Her dress
was a simple thing that did not
have a store label on it, and so
I dug the stitches for a bit and
decided that it had been hand
made. Someone was a fine dress-maker
because it fitted her
slender body perfectly. Her petticoat
was store type. It was
simple and fitted, too, but it had
a label from Forresters in the
hem. Her bra was a Graceform,
size thirty two, medium cup, but
the girl on the bed did not have
much need for molding, shaping,
uplifting, padding or pretense.
She was all her and she filled it
right to the brim. I let my perception
dawdle on the slender
ankles, the lissome waist, and the
rounded hips.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My door key came out by
habit-reflex and entered the keyhole
while my sense of perception
let them have one last
vicarious thrill. The girl on the
bed was an honest allover strawberry
blonde. She....</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the door swung open and
hell went out for breakfast.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My forty-five bellowed at the
light as I slid in and sloped to
one side. The room went dark as
I dropped to the floor in front of
my bookcase. From across the
room a hitburner seared the door
and slashed sidewise, cutting a
smoking swathe across my encyclopedia
from A-AUD to
CAN-DAN and then came down
as I squirmed aside. It took King
Lear right out of Shakespeare
before the beam winked out. It
went off just in time to keep me
from sporting a cooked stripe
down my face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I triggered the automatic
again to make a flash in their
faces while I dug the room to
locate them in the dark. The
needle beam flared out again and
drilled a hole in the bookcase
behind me. The other guy made
a slashing motion with his beam
to pin me down, but he made a
mistake by standing up to do it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I put a slug in his middle that
slammed him back against the
wall. He hung there for a moment
before he fell to the floor
with a dull, limp sound. His
needle beam slashed upward and
burned the ceiling before his
hand went limp and let the
weapon drop.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I whirled to dig the other guy
in the room just as the throb
of a stun-gun beam moaned
over my head. I wondered where
they'd got the arsenal, dug the
serial number, and realized that
it was mine. It gave me a
chuckle. I'm a pistol man, so the
stun-gun that old gorilla-man
was toting couldn't have had
more than one more charge. I
tried to dig it but couldn't. Even
a Doctor Of Perception can't
really dig the number of kilo-watt-seconds<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in a meson chamber.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My accurate esping must have
made the other guy desperate,
because he made a dive and let
his needle ray burn out a slashing
beam that zipped across over
my head. My forty-five blazed
twice. He missed but I didn't,
just as the throb of the stun-gun
rang the air again. I whirled to
face my stun-gun coming out of
the bedroom door in front of
Martha Franklin.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slug intended for Martha's
body never came out of my gun
because her stun-gun got to me
first. It froze me like a hunk of
Greek statuary and I went forward
and toppled over until I
came on a three-point landing of
elbow, the opposite knee, and the
side of my face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was as good as dead.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My brain was still functioning
but nothing else was. I was completely
paralyzed. My heart had
stopped breathing and my lungs
had stopped breathing, and I've
been told that a healthy man can
retain consciousness for maybe
a minute or so without a fresh
supply of blood to the brain.
Then things get muddy black and
you've had it for good. My esp
was still functioning, but that
would black out with the rest
of Steve Hammond.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was no physical pain.
They could have drilled me with
a blunt two-by-four and I'd not
have felt it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then because I couldn't stare
Death in the face, I shut my
mind on the fact and esped my
late girl friend. She was standing
there with my stun-gun in
her hand with a smile on her
beautiful puss and that vibrant
body swaying gently. I wanted
to vomit and I would have if I'd
not been frozen solid. That beautiful
body presided over by that
vicious brain made me sick.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her smile faded as I began to
realize the truth. Her story was
thin. Rambaugh, a mental, would
have been able to play his blackmail
game to the fine degree; he
would have known when
Martha's patience was about to
grow short--if Martha's story
were true. No blackmailer
pushed his victim to the breaking
point. And Rambaugh
wouldn't have gone for me if
this had just been a plain case
of blackmail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No, by thinking deeply,
Martha Franklin had engineered
the death of Rambaugh and she'd
almost engineered the rubbing-out
of Scarmann. A mental,
Martha Franklin. A high-grade
mental, capable of controlling her
thoughts so that her cohorts
could be led by the mind into
doing her dirty work.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My mind chuckled. I'd be gone<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before they caught up with
Martha, but they'd catch up all
right. She'd leave the apartment
positively radiating her act of
violence and then the cops would
have a catch. And you should see
how a set of Court Mentalists go
to work on a guilty party these
days. Once they get the guy that
pulled the trigger on the witness
stand, in front of a jury consisting
of mixed mentals and espers,
with no holds barred, the court
record gets a full load of the
killer's life, adventures, habits,
and attitude; just before the
guilty party heads for the readjustment
chamber.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Things were growing blacker.
Waves of darkness clouded my
mind and I found it hard to
think straight. My esper sense
faded first and as it faded I let
it run once more over Martha's
attractiveness and found my
darkening mind wishing that she
were the girl I'd believed her to
be instead of the female louse
she was. It could have been fun.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But now I was about to black
out from stun-gun paralysis, and
Martha was headed for the readjustment
chamber where they'd
reduce her mental activity to the
level of a menial, sterilize her,
and put her to work in an occupation
that no man or woman
with a spark of intelligence, ambition,
or good sense would take.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She would live and die a half-robot,
alone and ignored, her
attractiveness lost because of her
own lack-luster mind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And I'd been willing to go out
and plug Scarmann for her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hah!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And then she was at my side.
I perceived her dimly, inconstantly,
through the waves of
blackness and unreality that
were like the half-dreams that
we have when lying a-doze. She
levered my frozen body over on
its hard back and went to work
on my chest. Her arms went
around me and she squeezed. Air
whooshed into my dead lungs,
and then she was beating my
breastbone black and blue with
her small fists. Beat. Beat-beat.
Beat. I couldn't feel a thing but
I could dig the fact that she was
hurting her hands as she beat on
my chest in a rhythm that
matched the beat of her own
heart.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I dug her own heartbeat for
her, and she read my mind and
matched the beat perfectly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then I felt a thump inside of
me and dug my own heart. It
throbbed once, sluggishly. It
struggled, slowly. Then it throbbed
to the beat of her hands and
the blackening waves went away.
My frozen body relaxed and I
came down to rest on the floor
like a melting lump of sugar.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martha dropped on top of my<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
body and pressed me down. Her
arms were around my chest as
she forced air into my lungs.
She beat my ribs sore when my
heart faltered, and squeezed me
when my breathing slowed. I felt
the life coming back into me; it
came in like the tide, with a
fringe of needles-and-pins that
flowed inward from fingers and
toes and scalp.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martha pressed me down on
the carpet and kissed me, full,
open mouthed, passionate. It
stirred my blood and my mind
and I took a deep, shuddering
breath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I looked up into her soft blue
eyes and said, "Thanks--slut!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She kissed me again, pressing
me down and writhing against
me and obviously getting a kick
out of my reaction.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then I came alive and threw
her off with no warning. I sat
up, and swung a roundhouse
right that clipped her on the
jaw and sent her rolling over and
over. Her eyes glazed for a moment
but she came out of it and
looked pained and miserable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"You promised," she said
huskily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Promised?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"To kill Scarmann."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Yeah?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"You thought how you'd kill
Scarmann for me, Steve."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Someday," I said flatly, "I
may kill Scarmann, but it won't
be for you!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She tried to claw me but I
clipped her again and this time
I made it stick. She went out
cold and she was still out like a
frozen herring by the time Lieutenant
Williamson arrived with
his jetcopter squad to take her
away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last time I saw Martha
Franklin, she was still trying to
convince twelve Rhine Scholars
and True that any woman with
a body as beautiful as hers
couldn't possibly have committed
any crime. She was good at it,
but not that good.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Funny. Mental sensitives always
think they're so damn
superior  to  anyone  else.</p>
