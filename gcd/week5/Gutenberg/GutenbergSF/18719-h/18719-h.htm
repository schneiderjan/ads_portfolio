<p><b>Joe Kenmore heard the airlock close
with a sickening wheeze and then a clank. In desperation
he turned toward Haney. "My God, we've
been locked out!"</b></p>

<p><b>Through the transparent domes of their
space helmets, Joe could see a look of horror and
disbelief pass across Haney's face. But it was true!
Joe and his crew were locked out of the Space
Platform.</b></p>

<p><b>Four thousand miles below circled the
Earth. Under Joe's feet rested the solid steel hull
of his home in outer space. But without tools there
was no hope of getting back inside. Joe looked at
his oxygen meter. It registered thirty minutes to live.</b></p>

<p>To the world at large, of course, it was
just another day. A different sort entirely at different places
on the great, round, rolling Earth, but nothing out of the ordinary.
It was Tuesday on one side of the Date Line and
Monday on the other. It was so-and-so's wedding anniversary
and so-and-so's birthday and another so-and-so would get
out of jail today. It was warm, it was cool, it was fair, it was
cloudy. One looked forward to the future with confidence,
with hope, with uneasiness or with terror according to one's
temperament and one's geographical location and past history.
To most of the human race this was nothing whatever but just
another day.</p>

<p>But to Joe Kenmore it was a most particular day indeed.
Here, it was the gray hour just before sunrise and already
there were hints of reddish colorings in the sky. It was chilly,
and somehow the world seemed still and breathless. To Joe,
the feeling of tensity marked this morning off from all the
other mornings of his experience.</p>

<p>He got up and began to dress, in Major Holt's quarters back
of that giant steel half-globe called the Shed, near the town
of Bootstrap. He felt queer because he felt so much as usual.
By all the rules, he should have experienced a splendid, noble
resolution and a fiery exaltation, and perhaps even an admirable
sensation of humility and unworthiness to accomplish
what was expected of him today. And, deep enough inside, he
felt suitable emotion. But it happened that he couldn't take
time to feel things adequately today.</p>

<p>He was much more aware that he wanted some coffee
rather badly, and that he hoped everything would go all right.
He looked out of the windows at empty, dreary desert under
the dawn sky. Today was the day he'd be leaving on a rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
important journey. He hoped that Haney and the Chief and
Mike weren't nervous. He also hoped that nobody had gotten
at the fuel for the pushpots, and that the slide-rule crew that
had calculated everything hadn't made any mistakes. He was
also bothered about the steering-rocket fuel, and he was uncomfortable
about the business of releasing the spaceship from
the launching cage. There was, too, cause for worry in the
take-off rockets&mdash;if the tube linings had shrunk there would
be some rather gruesome consequences&mdash;and there could
always be last-minute orders from Washington to delay or
even cancel everything.</p>

<p>In short, his mind was full of strictly practical details.
He didn't have time to feel noble aspirations or sensations
of high destiny. He had a very tricky and exacting job ahead
of him.</p>

<p>The sky was growing lighter outside. Stars faded in a
paling blue and the desert showed faint colorings. He tied his
necktie. A deep-toned keening set up off to the southward,
over the sere and dreary landscape. It was a faraway noise,
something like the lament of a mountain-sized calf bleating
for its mother. Joe took a deep breath. He looked, but saw
nothing. The noise, though, told him that there'd been no
cancellation of orders so far. He mentally uncrossed one pair
of fingers. He couldn't possibly cross fingers against all foreseeable
disasters. There weren't enough fingers&mdash;or toes
either. But it was good that so far the schedule held.</p>

<p>He went downstairs. Major Holt was pacing up and down
the living room of his quarters. Electric lights burned, but
already the windows were brightening. Joe straightened up
and tried to look casual. Strictly speaking, Major Holt was a
family friend who happened also to be security officer here,
in charge of protecting what went on in the giant construction
Shed. He'd had a sufficiently difficult time of it in the
past, and the difficulties might keep on in the future. He
was also the ranking officer here and consequently the immediate
boss of Joe's enterprise. Today's affair was still
highly precarious. The whole thing was controversial and
uncertain and might spoil the career of somebody with stars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
on his collar if it should fail. So nobody in the high brass
wanted the responsibility. If everything went well, somebody
suitable would take the credit and the bows. Meanwhile
Major Holt was boss by default.</p>

<p>He looked sharply at Joe. "Morning."</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said Joe. Major Holt's daughter Sally
had a sort of understanding with Joe, but the major hadn't
the knack of cordiality, and nobody felt too much at ease with
him. Besides, Joe was wearing a uniform for the first time
this morning. There were only eight such uniforms in the
world, so far. It was black whipcord, with an Eisenhower
jacket, narrow silver braid on the collar and cuffs, and a silver
rocket for a badge where a plane pilot wears his wings. It
was strictly practical. Against accidental catchings in machinery,
the trousers were narrow and tucked into ten-inch
soft leather boots, and the wide leather belt had flat loops
for the attachment of special equipment. Its width was a
brace against the strains of acceleration. Sally had had much
to do with its design.</p>

<p>But it hadn't yet been decided by the Pentagon whether
the Space Exploration Project would be taken over by the
Army or the Navy or the Air Corps, so Joe wore no insignia
of rank. Technically he was still a civilian.</p>

<p>The deep-toned noise to the south had become a howl,
sweeping closer and trailed by other howlings.</p>

<p>"The pushpots are on the way over, as you can hear," said
the major detachedly, in the curious light of daybreak and
electric bulbs together. "Your crew is up and about. So far
there seems to be no hitch. You're feeling all right for the
attempt today?"</p>

<p>"If you want the truth, sir, I'd feel better with about ten
years' practical experience behind me. But my gang and myself&mdash;we've
had all the training we can get without an actual
take-off. We're the best-trained crew to try it. I think we'll
manage."</p>

<p>"I see," said the major. "You'll do your best."</p>

<p>"We may have to do better than that," admitted Joe wrily.</p>

<p>"True enough. You may." The major paused. "You're well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
aware that there are&mdash;ah&mdash;people who do not altogether like
the idea of the United States possessing an artificial satellite
of Earth."</p>

<p>"I ought to know it," admitted Joe.</p>

<p>The Earth's second, man-constructed moon&mdash;out in space
for just six weeks now&mdash;didn't seem nowadays like the bitterly
contested achievement it actually was. From Earth it was
merely a tiny speck of light in the sky, identifiable for what it
was only because it moved so swiftly and serenely from the
sunset toward the east, or from night's darkness into the dawn-light.
But it had been fought bitterly before it was launched.
It was first proposed to the United Nations, but even discussion
in the Council was vetoed. So the United States had built
it alone. Yet the nations which objected to it as an international
project liked it even less as a national one, and they'd
done what they could to wreck it.</p>

<p>The building of the great steel hull now out there in emptiness
had been fought more bitterly, by more ruthless and more
highly trained saboteurs, than any other enterprise in history.
There'd been two attempts to blast it with atomic bombs. But
it was high aloft, rolling grandly around the Earth, so close
to its primary that its period was little more than four hours;
and it rose in the west and set in the east six times a day.</p>

<p>Today Joe would try to get a supply ship up to it, a very
small rocket-driven cargo ship named Pelican One. The crew
of the Platform needed food and air and water&mdash;and especially
the means of self-defense. Today's take-off would be the first
attempt at a rocket-lift to space.</p>

<p>"The enemies of the Platform haven't given up," said the
major formidably. "And they used spectroscopes on the Platform's
rocket fumes. Apparently they've been able to duplicate
our fuel."</p>

<p>Joe nodded.</p>

<p>Major Holt went on: "For more than a month Military Intelligence
has been aware that rockets were under construction
behind the Iron Curtain. They will be guided missiles,
and they will carry atom bomb heads. One or more may be
finished any day. When they're finished, you can bet that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
they'll be used against the Platform. And you will carry up the
first arms for the Platform. Your ship carries half a dozen long-range
interceptor rockets to handle any attack from Earth. It's
vitally important for them to be delivered."</p>

<p>"They'll attack the Platform?" demanded Joe angrily.
"That's war!"</p>

<p>"Not if they deny guilt," said the major ironically, "and if
we have nothing to gain by war. The Platform is intended to
defend the peace of the world. If it is destroyed, we won't
defend the peace of the world by going to war over it. But
while the Platform can defend itself, it is not likely that anyone
will dare to make war. So you have a very worthwhile mission.
I suggest that you have breakfast and report to the Shed.
I'm on my way there now."</p>

<p>Joe said, "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The major started for the door. Then he stopped. He hesitated,
and said abruptly, "If my security measures have failed,
Joe, you'll be killed. If there has been sabotage or carelessness,
it will be my fault."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, sir, that everything anybody could do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything anybody can do to destroy you has been done,"
said the major grimly. "Not only sabotage, Joe, but blunders
and mistakes and stupidities. That always happens. But&mdash;I've
done my best. I suspect I'm asking your forgiveness if my best
hasn't been good enough."</p>

<p>Then, before Joe could reply, the major went hurriedly
away.</p>

<p>Joe frowned for a moment. It occurred to him that it must
be pretty tough to be responsible for the things that other
men's lives depend on&mdash;when you can't share their danger.
But just then the smell of coffee reached his nostrils. He
trailed the scent. There was a coffeepot steaming on the table
in the dining-room. There was a note on a plate.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Good luck. I'll see you in the Shed.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;"><i>Sally</i></p></div>

<p>Joe was relieved. Sally Holt had been somewhere around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
underfoot all his life. She was a swell girl, but he was grateful
that he didn't have to talk to her just now.</p>

<p>He poured coffee and looked at his watch. He went to the
window. The faraway howling was much nearer, and dawn
had definitely arrived. Small cloudlets in a pale blue sky were
tinted pinkish by the rising sun. Patches of yucca and mesquite
and sage out beyond the officers' quarters area stretched
away to a far-off horizon. They were now visibly different in
color from the red-yellow earth between them, and cast long,
streaky shadows. The cause of the howling was still invisible.</p>

<p>But Joe cared nothing for that. He stared skyward, searching.
And he saw what he looked for.</p>

<p>There was a small bright sliver of sunlight high aloft. It
moved slowly toward the east. It showed the unmistakable
glint of sunshine upon polished steel. It was the artificial satellite&mdash;a
huge steel hull&mdash;which had been built in the gigantic
Shed from whose shadow Joe looked upward. It was the size
of an ocean liner, and six weeks since some hundreds of pushpots,
all straining at once, had gotten it out of the Shed and
panted toward the sky with it. They'd gotten it twelve miles
high and speeding eastward at the ultimate speed they could
manage. They'd fired jato rockets, all at once, and so pushed
its speed up to the preposterous. Then they'd dropped away
and the giant steel thing had fired its own rockets&mdash;which made
mile-long flames&mdash;and swept on out to emptiness. Before its
rockets were consumed it was in an orbit 4,000 miles above
the Earth's surface, and it hurtled through space at something
over 12,000 miles an hour. It circled the Earth in exactly four
hours, fourteen minutes, and twenty-two seconds. And it
would continue its circling forever, needing no fuel and never
descending. It was a second moon for the planet Earth.</p>

<p>But it could be destroyed.</p>

<p>Joe watched hungrily as it went on to meet the sun.
Smoothly, unhurriedly, serenely, the remote and twinkling
speck floated on out of sight. And then Joe went back to the
table and ate his breakfast quickly. He wolfed it. He had an
appointment to meet that minute speck some 4,000 miles out
in space. His appointment was for a very few hours hence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>He'd been training for just this morning's effort since before
the Platform's launching. There was a great box swinging in
twenty-foot gimbal rings over in the Shed. There were motors
and projectors and over two thousand vacuum tubes, relays
and electronic units. It was a space flight simulator&mdash;a descendant
of the Link trainer which once taught plane pilots how to
fly. But this offered the problems and the sensations of rocketship
control, and for many hours every day Joe and the three
members of his crew had labored in it. The simulator duplicated
every sight and sound and feeling&mdash;all but heavy acceleration&mdash;to
be experienced in the take-off of a rocketship
to space. The similitude of flight was utterly convincing.
Sometimes it was appallingly so when emergencies and catastrophes
and calamities were staged in horrifying detail for
them to learn to respond to. In six weeks they'd learned how
to handle a spaceship so far as anybody could learn on solid
ground&mdash;if the simulator was correctly built. Nobody could be
sure about that. But it was the best training that could be
devised.</p>

<p>In minutes Joe had finished the coffee and was out of Major
Holt's quarters and headed for the Shed's nearest entrance.
The Shed was a gigantic metal structure rising out of sheer
flat desert. There were hills to the westward, but only arid
plain to the east and south and north. There was but one town
in hundreds of miles and that was Bootstrap, built to house
the workmen who'd built the Platform and the still invisible,
ferociously howling pushpots and now the small supply ships,
the first of which was to make its first trip today.</p>

<p>The Shed seemed very near because of its monstrous size.
When he was actually at the base of its wall, it seemed to
fill half the firmament and more than half the horizon. He
went in, and felt self-conscious when the guard's eyes fell on
his uniform. There was a tiny vestibule. Then he was in the
Shed itself, and it was enormous.</p>

<p>There were acres of wood-block flooring. There was a vast,
steel-girdered arching roof which was fifty stories high in the
center. All this size had been needed when the Space Platform
was being built. Men on the far side were merely specks, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the rows of windows to admit light usually did no more than
make a gray twilight inside. But there was light enough today.
To the east the Shed's wall was split from top to bottom. A
colossal triangular gore had been loosened and thrust out and
rolled aside, and a doorway a hundred and fifty feet wide let
in the sunshine. Through it, Joe could see the fiery red ball
which was the sun just leaving the horizon.</p>

<p>But there was something more urgent for him to look at.
Pelican One had been moved into its launching cage. Only
Joe, perhaps, would really have recognized it. Actually it was
a streamlined hull of steel, eighty feet long by twenty in
diameter. There were stubby metal fins&mdash;useless in space, and
even on take-off, but essential for the planned method of
landing on its return. There were thick quartz ports in the
bow-section. But its form was completely concealed now by
the attached, exterior take-off rockets. It had been shifted into
the huge cradle of steel beams from which it was to be
launched. Men swarmed about it and over it, in and out of the
launching cage, checking and rechecking every possible thing
that could make for the success of its flight to space.</p>

<p>The other three crew-members were ready&mdash;Haney and
Chief Bender and Mike Scandia. They were especially entitled
to be the crew of this first supply ship. When the Platform
was being built, its pilot-gyros had been built by a
precision tool firm owned by Joe's father. He'd gone by plane
with the infinitely precise apparatus to Bootstrap, to deliver
and install it in the Platform. And the plane was sabotaged,
and the gyros were ruined. They'd consumed four months in
the building, and four months more for balancing with absolute
no-tolerance accuracy. The Platform couldn't wait so
long for duplicates. So Joe had improvised a method of repair.
And with Haney to devise special machine-tool setups and
the Chief to use fanatically fine workmanship, and Mike and
Joe aiding according to their gifts, they'd rebuilt the apparatus
in an impossibly short time. The original notion was Joe's, but
he couldn't have done the job without the others.</p>

<p>And there had been other, incidental triumphs by the team
of four. They were not the only ones who worked feverishly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
for the glory of having helped to build the Earth's first artificial
moon, but they had accomplished more than most. Joe
had even been appointed to be an alternate member of the
Platform's crew. But the man he was to have substituted for
recovered from an illness, and Joe was left behind at the
Platform's launching. But all of them had rated some reward,
and it was to serve in the small ships that would supply the
man-made satellite.</p>

<p>Now they were ready to begin. The Chief grinned exuberantly
as Joe ducked through the bars of the launching
cage and approached the ship. He was a Mohawk Indian&mdash;one
of that tribe which for two generations had supplied steel
workers to every bridge and dam and skyscraper job on the
continent. He was brown and bulky and explosive. Haney
looked tense and strained. He was tall and lean and spare,
and a good man in any sort of trouble. Mike blazed excitement.
Mike was forty-one inches high and he was full-grown. He had
worked on the Platform, bucking rivets and making welds
and inspections in places too small for a normal-sized man to
reach. He frantically resented any concessions to his size and
he was as good a man as any. He simply was the small, economy
size.</p>

<p>"Hiya, Joe," boomed the Chief. "All set? Had breakfast?"</p>

<p>Joe nodded. He began to ask anxious questions. About
steering-rocket fuel and the launching cage release and the
take-off rockets and the reduction valve from the air tanks&mdash;he'd
thought of that on the way over&mdash;and the short wave and
loran and radar. Haney nodded to some questions. Mike said
briskly, "I checked" to others.</p>

<p>The Chief grunted amiably, "Look, Joe! We checked everything
last night. We checked it again this morning. I even
caught Mike polishing the ejection seats, because there wasn't
anything else to make sure of!"</p>

<p>Joe managed a smile. The ejection seats were assuredly the
most unlikely of all devices to be useful today. They were
supposedly life-saving devices. If the ship came a cropper on
take-off, the four of them were supposed to use ejection-seats
like those supplied to jet pilots. They would be thrown clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the ship and ribbon-parachutes might open and might let
them land alive. But it wasn't likely. Joe had objected to
their presence. If a feather dropped to Earth from a height of
600 miles, it would be falling so fast when it hit the atmosphere
that it would heat up and burn to ashes from pure air-friction.
It wasn't likely that they could get out of the ship if
anything went wrong.</p>

<p>Somebody marched stiffly toward the four of them. Joe's
expression grew rueful. The Space Project was neither Army
nor Navy nor Air Corps, but something that so far was its own
individual self. But the man marching toward Joe was Lieutenant
Commander Brown, strictly Navy, assigned to the Shed
as an observer. And there were some times when he baffled
Joe. Like now.</p>

<p>He halted, and looked as if he expected Joe to salute. Joe
didn't.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Commander Brown said, formally: "I would
like to offer my best wishes for your trip, Mr. Kenmore."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Joe.</p>

<p>Brown smiled distantly. "You understand, of course, that I
consider navigation essentially a naval function, and it does
seem to me that any ship, including a spaceship, should be
manned by naval personnel. But I assuredly wish you good
fortune."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Joe again.</p>

<p>Brown shook hands, then stalked off.</p>

<p>Haney rumbled in his throat. "How come, Joe, he doesn't
wish all of us good luck?"</p>

<p>"He does," said Joe. "But his mind's in uniform too. He's
been trained that way. I'd like to make a bet that we have him
as a passenger out to the Platform some day."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" growled Haney.</p>

<p>There was an outrageous tumult outside the wide-open gap
in the Shed's wall. Something went shrieking by the doorway.
It looked like the magnified top half of a loaf of baker's bread,
painted gray and equipped with an air-scoop in front and a
plastic bubble for a pilot. It howled like a lost baby dragon,
its flat underside tilted up and up until it was almost vertical.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
It had no wings, but a blue-white flame spurted out of
its rear, wobbling from side to side for reasons best known to
itself. It was a pushpot, which could not possibly be called a
jet plane because it could not possibly fly. Only it did. It
settled down on its flame-spouting tail, and the sparse vegetation
burst into smoky flame and shriveled, and the thing&mdash;still
shrieking like a fog-horn in a tunnel&mdash;flopped flat forward
with a resounding <i>clank!</i> It was abruptly silent.</p>

<p>But the total noise was not lessened. Another pushpot
came soaring wildly into view, making hysterical outcries. It
touched and banged violently to earth. Others appeared in
the air beyond the construction Shed. One flopped so hard
on landing that its tail rose in the air and it attempted a
somersault. It made ten times more noise than before&mdash;the
flame from its tail making wild gyrations&mdash;and flopped back
again with a crash. Two others rolled over on their sides after
touching ground. One ended up on its back like a tumble-bug,
wriggling.</p>

<p>They seemed to land by hundreds, but their number was
actually in dozens. It was not until the last one was down
that Joe could make himself heard. The pushpots were jet
motors in frames and metal skin, with built-in jato rocket
tubes besides their engines. On the ground they were quite
helpless. In the air they were unbelievably clumsy. They were
actually balanced and steered by vanes in the blasts of their
jets, and they combined the absolute maximum of sheer thrust
with the irreducible minimum of flyability.</p>

<p>Crane-trucks went out to pick them up. Joe said anxiously,
"We'd better check our flight plan again. We have to know it
absolutely!"</p>

<p>He headed across the floor to the flight data board. He
passed the hull of another ship like his own, which was near
completion, and the bare skeletons of two others which needed
a lot of work yet. They'd been begun at distant plants and then
hauled here on monstrous trailers for completion. The wooden
mockup of the design for all the ships&mdash;in which every possible
arrangement of instruments and machinery had been
tested out&mdash;lay neglected by the Shed wall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The four stood before the flight data board. It listed the
readings every instrument should show during every instant
of the flight. The readings had been calculated with infinite
care, and Joe and the others needed to know them rather better
than they knew their multiplication tables. Once they
started out, they wouldn't have time to wonder if everything
was right for the time and place. They needed to know.</p>

<p>They stood there, soaking up the information the board
contained, forming mental pictures of it, making as sure as
possible that any one of them would spot anything wrong the
instant it showed up, and would instantly know what had to
be done about it.</p>

<p>A gigantic crane-truck came in through the wide doorway.
It dangled a pushpot. It rolled over to the launching cage in
which the spaceship lay and set the unwieldy metal object
against that cage. There was a <i>clank</i> as the pushpot caught
hold of the magnetic grapples. The crane went out again, passing
a second crane carrying a second pushpot. The second
beetle-like thing was presented to the cage. It stuck fast. The
crane went out for more.</p>

<p>Major Holt came across the floor of the Shed. It took him a
long time to walk the distance from the Security offices to the
launching cage. When he got there, he looked impatiently
around. His daughter Sally came out of nowhere and blew her
nose as if she'd been crying, and pointed to the data board.
The major shrugged his shoulders and looked uneasily at her.
She regarded him with some defiance. The major spoke to her
sternly. They waited.</p>

<p>The cranes brought in more pushpots and set them up
against the steel launching cage. The ship had been nearly
hidden before by the rocket tubes fastened outside its hull.
It went completely out of sight behind the metal monsters
banked about it.</p>

<p>The major looked at his watch and the group about the
data board. They moved away from it and back toward the
ship. Joe saw the major and swerved over to him.</p>

<p>"I have brought you," said the major in an official voice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
"the invoice of your cargo. You will deliver the invoice with
the cargo and bring back proper receipts."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Joe.</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> hope!" said Sally in a strained tone. "Good luck, Joe!"</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"There is not much to say to you," said the major without
visible emotion. "Of course the next crew will start its training
immediately, but it may be a month before another ship
can take off. It is extremely desirable that you reach the Platform
today."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Joe wrily. "I have even a personal motive to
get there. If I don't, I break my neck."</p>

<p>The major ignored the comment. He shook hands formally
and marched away. Sally smiled up at Joe, but her eyes were
suddenly full of tears.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;do hope everything goes all right, Joe," she said unsteadily.
"I&mdash;I'll be praying for you."</p>

<p>"I can use some of that, too," admitted Joe.</p>

<p>She looked at her hand. Joe's ring was on her finger&mdash;wrapped
with string on the inside of the band to make it fit.
Then she looked up again and was crying unashamedly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;will," she repeated. Then she said fiercely, "I don't care
if somebody's looking, Joe. It's time for you to go in the ship."</p>

<p>He kissed her, and turned and went quickly to the peculiar
mass of clustered pushpots, touching and almost overlapping
each other.</p>

<p>He ducked under and looked back. Sally waved. He waved
back. Then he climbed up the ladder into Pelican One's
cabin. Somebody pulled the ladder away and scuttled out of
the cage.</p>

<p>The others were in their places. Joe slowly closed the door
from the cabin to the outer world. There was suddenly a
cushioned silence about him. Out the quartz-glass ports he
could see ahead, out the end of the cage through the monstrous
doorway to the desert beyond. Overhead he could see
the dark, girder-lined roof of the Shed. On either side, though,
he could see only the scratched, dented, flat undersides of the
pushpots ready to lift the ship upward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can start on the pushpot motors, Haney," he said
curtly.</p>

<p>Joe moved to his own, the pilot's seat. Haney pushed a
button. Through the fabric of the ship came the muted uproar
of a pushpot engine starting. Haney pushed another
button. Another. Another. More jet engines bellowed. The
tumult in the Shed would be past endurance, now.</p>

<p>Joe strapped himself into his seat. He made sure that the
Chief at the steering-rocket manual controls was fastened
properly, and Mike at the radio panel was firmly belted past
the chance of injury.</p>

<p>Haney said with enormous calm, "All pushpot motors <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: The original reads 'runing'.">running</ins>,
Joe."</p>

<p>"Steering rockets ready," the Chief reported.</p>

<p>"Radio operating," came from Mike. "Communications
room all set."</p>

<p>Joe reached to the maneuver controls. He should have been
sweating. His hands, perhaps, should have quivered with tension.
But he was too much worried about too many things.
Nobody can strike an attitude or go into a blue funk while they
are worrying about things to be done. Joe heard the small
gyro motors as their speed went up. A hum and a whine and
then a shrill whistle which went up in pitch until it wasn't
anything at all. He frowned anxiously and said to Haney,
"I'm taking over the pushpots."</p>

<p>Haney nodded. Joe took the over-all control. The roar of
engines outside grew loud on the right-hand side, and died
down. It grew thunderous to the left, and dwindled. The ones
ahead pushed. Then the ones behind. Joe nodded and wet his
lips. He said: "Here we go."</p>

<p>There was no more ceremony than that. The noise of the
jet motors outside rose to a thunderous volume which came
even through the little ship's insulated hull. Then it grew
louder, and louder still, and Joe stirred the controls by ever so
tiny a movement.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ship did not feel solid. It stirred a little. Joe
held his breath and cracked the over-all control of the pushpots'
speed a tiny trace further. The ship wobbled a little. Out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the quartz-glass windows, the great door seemed to descend.
In reality the clustered pushpots and the launching cage rose
some thirty feet from the Shed floor and hovered there uncertainly.
Joe shifted the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: The original reads 'level'.">lever</ins> that governed the vanes in the
jet motor blasts. Ship and cage and pushpots, all together,
wavered toward the doorway. They passed out of it, rocking
a little and pitching a little and wallowing a little. As a flying
device, the combination was a howling tumult and a horror.
It was an aviation designer's nightmare. It was a bad dream
by any standard.</p>

<p>But it wasn't meant as a way to fly from one place to another
on Earth. It was the first booster stage of a three-stage rocket
aimed at outer space. It looked rather like&mdash;well&mdash;if a swarm
of bumblebees clung fiercely to a wire-gauze cage in which
lay a silver minnow wrapped in match-sticks; and if the bees
buzzed furiously and lifted it in a straining, clumsy, and altogether
unreasonable manner; and if the appearance and the
noise together were multiplied a good many thousands of
times&mdash;why&mdash;it would present a great similarity to the take-off
of the spaceship under Joe's command. Nothing like it could
be graceful or neatly controllable or even very speedy in the
thick atmosphere near the ground. But higher, it would be
another matter.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> another matter. Once clear of the Shed, and with
flat, sere desert ahead to the very horizon, Joe threw on full
power to the pushpot motors. The clumsy-seeming aggregation
of grotesque objects began to climb. Ungainly it was, and
clumsy it was, but it went upward at a rate a jet-fighter might
have trouble matching. It wobbled, and it swung around and
around, and it tipped crazily, the whole aggregation of jet
motors and cage and burden of spaceship as a unit. But it rose!</p>

<p>The ground dropped so swiftly that even the Shed seemed
to shrivel like a pricked balloon. The horizon retreated as if
a carpet were hastily unrolled by magic. The barometric pressure
needles turned.</p>

<p>"Communications says our rate-of-climb is 4,000 feet a
minute and going up fast," Mike announced. "It's five....
We're at 17,000 feet ... 18,000. We should get some eastward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
velocity at 32,000 feet. Our height is now 21,000
feet...."</p>

<p>There was no change in the feel of things inside the ship,
of course. Sealed against the vacuum of space, barometric
pressure outside made no difference. Height had no effect on
the air inside the ship.</p>

<p>At 25,000 feet the Chief said suddenly: "We're pointed
due east, Joe. Freeze it?"</p>

<p>"Right," said Joe. "Freeze it."</p>

<p>The Chief threw a lever. The gyros were running at full
operating speed. By engaging them, the Chief had all their
stored-up kinetic energy available to resist any change of direction
the pushpots might produce by minor variations in
their thrusts. Haney brooded over the reports from the individual
engines outside. He made minute adjustments to
keep them balanced. Mike uttered curt comments into the
communicator from time to time.</p>

<p>At 33,000 feet there was a momentary sensation as if the
ship were tilted sharply. It wasn't. The instruments denied
any change from level rise. The upward-soaring complex of
flying things had simply risen into a jet-stream, one of those
wildly rushing wind-floods of the upper atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Eastern velocity four hundred," said Mike from the communicator.
"Now four-twenty-five.... Four-forty."</p>

<p>There was a 300-mile-an-hour wind behind them. A tail-wind,
west to east. The pushpots struggled now to get the maximum
possible forward thrust before they rose out of that east-bound
hurricane. They added a fierce push to eastward to their
upward thrust. Mike's cracked voice reported 500 miles an
hour. Presently it was 600.</p>

<p>At 40,000 feet they were moving eastward at 680 miles
an hour. A jet-motor cannot be rated except indirectly, but
there was over 200,000 horsepower at work to raise the spacecraft
and build up the highest possible forward speed. It
couldn't be kept up, of course. The pushpots couldn't carry
enough fuel.</p>

<p>But they reached 55,000 feet, which is where space begins
for humankind. A man exposed to emptiness at that height will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
die just as quickly as anywhere between the stars. But it
wasn't quite empty space for the pushpots. There was still a
very, very little air. The pushpots could still thrust upward.
Feebly, now, but they still thrust.</p>

<p>Mike said: "Communications says get set to fire jatos, Joe."</p>

<p>"Right!" he replied. "Set yourselves."</p>

<p>Mike flung a switch, and a voice began to chatter behind
Joe's head. It was the voice from the communications-room
atop the Shed, now far below and far behind. Mike settled
himself in the tiny acceleration-chair built for him. The Chief
squirmed to comfort in his seat. Haney took his hands from the
equalizing adjustments he had to make so that Joe's use of
the controls would be exact, regardless of moment-to-moment
differences in the thrust of the various jets.</p>

<p>"We've got a yaw right," said the Chief sharply. "Hold it,
Joe!"</p>

<p>Joe waited for small quivering needles to return to their
proper registrations.</p>

<p>"Back and steady," said the Chief a moment later. "Okay!"</p>

<p>The tinny voice behind Joe now spoke precisely. Mike had
listened to it while the work of take-off could be divided, so
that Joe would not be distracted. Now Joe had to control
everything at once.</p>

<p>The roar of the pushpots outside the ship had long since
lost the volume and timbre of normal atmosphere. Not much
sound could be transmitted by the near-vacuum outside. But
the jet motors did roar, and the sound which was not sound at
such a height was transmitted by the metal cage as so much
pure vibration. The walls and hull of the spaceship picked up
a crawling, quivering pulsation and turned it into sound.
Standing waves set up and dissolved and moved erratically
in the air of the cabin. Joe's eardrums were strangely affected.
Now one ear seemed muted by a temporary difference of air
pressure where a standing wave lingered for a second or two.
Then the other eardrum itched. There were creeping sensations
as of things touching one and quickly moving away.</p>

<p>Joe swung a microphone into place before his mouth.</p>

<p>"All set," he said evenly. "Brief me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The tinny voice said:</p>

<p>"<i>You are at 65,000 feet. Your curve of rate-of-climb is
flattening out. You are now rising at near-maximum speed, and
not much more forward velocity can be anticipated. You have
an air-speed relative to surface of six-nine-two miles per hour.
The rotational speed of Earth at this latitude is seven-seven-eight.
You have, then, a total orbital speed of one-four-seven-oh
miles per hour, or nearly twelve per cent of your needed
final velocity. Since you will take off laterally and practically
without air resistance, a margin of safety remains. You are
authorized to blast.</i>"</p>

<p>Joe said:</p>

<p>"Ten seconds. Nine ... eight ... seven ... six ...
five ... four ... three ... two ... one...."</p>

<p>He stabbed the master jato switch. And a monstrous jato
rocket, built into each and every one of the pushpots outside,
flared chemical fumes in a simultaneous, gigantic thrust. A
small wire-wound jato for jet-assisted-take-off will weigh a
hundred and forty pounds and deliver a thousand pounds of
thrust for fourteen seconds. And that is for rockets using nonpoisonous
compounds. The jatos of the pushpots used the
beryllium-fluorine fuel that had lifted the Platform and that
filled the take-off rockets of Joe's ship. These jatos gave the
pushpots themselves an acceleration of ten gravities, but it
had to be shared with the cage and the ship. Still....</p>

<p>Joe felt himself slammed back into his seat with irresistible,
overwhelming force. The vibration from the jets had been bad.
Now he didn't notice it. He didn't notice much of anything but
the horrible sensations of six-gravity acceleration.</p>

<p>It was not exactly pain. It was a feeling as if a completely
intolerable and unbearable pressure pushed at him. Not only
on the outside, like a blow, but inside too, like nothing else
imaginable. Not only his chest pressed upon his lungs, but his
lungs strained toward his backbone. Not only the flesh of his
thighs tugged to flatten itself against his acceleration-chair,
but the blood in his legs tried to flow into and burst the blood-vessels
in the back of his legs.</p>

<p>The six-gravity acceleration seemed to endure for centuries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Actually, it lasted for fourteen seconds. In that time it increased
the speed of the little ship by rather more than half
a mile per second, something over 1,800 miles per hour. Before,
the ship had possessed an orbital speed of a shade over
1,470 miles an hour. After the jato thrust, it was traveling
nearly 3,400 miles per hour. It needed to travel something
over 12,000 miles per hour to reach the artificial satellite of
Earth.</p>

<p>The intolerable thrust ended abruptly. Joe gasped. But he
could allow himself only a shake of the head to clear his brain.
He jammed down the take-off rocket firing button. There was
a monstrous noise and a mighty surging, and Haney panted,
"Clear of cage...."</p>

<p>And then they were pressed fiercely against their acceleration
chairs again. The ship was no longer in its launching cage.
It was no longer upheld by pushpots. It was free, with its take-off
rockets flaming. It plunged on up and out. But the acceleration
was less. Nobody can stand six gravities for long.
Anybody can take three&mdash;for a while.</p>

<p>Joe's body resisted movement with a weight of four hundred
and fifty pounds, instead of a third as much for normal.
His heart had to pump against three times the normal resistance
of gravity. His chest felt as if it had a leaden weight
on it. His tongue tried to crowd the back of his mouth and
strangle him. The sensation was that of a nightmare of impossible
duration. It was possible to move and possible to see.
One could breathe, with difficulty, and with titanic effort one
could speak. But there was the same feeling of stifling resistance
to every movement that comes in nightmares.</p>

<p>But Joe managed to keep his eyes focused. The dials of the
instruments said that everything was right. The tinny voice
behind his head, its timbre changed by the weighting of its
diaphragm, said: "<i>All readings check within accuracy of instruments.
Good work!</i>"</p>

<p>Joe moved his eyes to a quartz window. The sky was black.
But there were stars. Bright stars against a black background.
At the same instant he saw the bright white disks of sunshine
that came in the cabin portholes. Stars and sunshine together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
And the sunshine was the sunshine of space. Even with the
polarizers cutting off some of the glare it was unbearably
bright and hot beyond conception. He smelled overheated
paint, where the sunlight smote on a metal bulkhead. Stars and
super-hot sunshine together....</p>

<p>It was necessary to pant for breath, and his heart pounded
horribly and his eyes tried to go out of focus, but Joe Kenmore
strained in his acceleration-chair and managed to laugh
a little.</p>

<p>"We did it!" he panted. "In case you didn't notice, we're
out of&mdash;the atmosphere and&mdash;out in space! We're&mdash;headed to
join the Space Platform!"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="c2" id="c2"></a><i>2</i></h2>


<p>The pressure of three gravities continued.
Joe's chest muscles ached with the exertion of breathing over
so long a period. Six gravities for fourteen seconds had been
a ghastly ordeal. Three gravities for minutes built up to
something nearly as bad. Joe's heart began to feel fatigue,
and a man's heart normally simply doesn't ever feel tired. It
became more and more difficult to see clearly.</p>

<p>But he had work to do. Important work. The take-off rockets
were solid-fuel jobs, like those which launched the Platform.
They were wire-wound steel tubes lined with a very special
refractory, with unstable beryllium and fluorine compounds in
them. The solid fuel burned at so many inches per second.
The refractory crumbled away and was hurled astern at a
corresponding rate&mdash;save for one small point. The refractory
was not all exactly alike. Some parts of it crumbled away faster,
leaving a pattern of baffles which acted like a maxim silencer
on a rifle, or like an automobile muffler. The baffles set
up eddies in the gas stream and produced exactly the effect of
a rocket motor's throat. But the baffles themselves crumbled
and were flung astern, so that the solid-fuel rockets had always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the efficiency of gas-throated rocket motors; and yet every bit
of refractory was reaction-mass to be hurled astern, and even
the steel tubes melted and were hurled away with a gain in
acceleration to the ship. Every fraction of every ounce of
rocket mass was used for drive. No tanks or pumps or burners
rode deadhead after they ceased to be useful.</p>

<p>But solid-fuel rockets simply can't be made to burn with
absolute evenness as a team. Minute differences in burning-rates
do tend to cancel out. But now and again they reinforce
each other and if uncorrected will throw a ship off course.
Gyros can't handle such effects. So Joe had to watch his instruments
and listen to the tinny voice behind him and steer
the ship against accidental wobblings as the Earth fell away
behind him.</p>

<p>He battled against the fatigue of continuing to live, and
struggled with gyros and steering jets to keep the ship on its
hair-line course. He panted heavily. The beating of his heart
became such a heavy pounding that it seemed that his whole
body shook with it. He had to do infinitely fine precision steering
with hands that weighed pounds and arms that weighed
scores of pounds and a body that had an effective weight of
almost a quarter of a ton.</p>

<p>And this went on and went on and on for what seemed
several centuries.</p>

<p>Then the voice in the speaker said thickly: "<i>Everything is
in the clear. In ten seconds you can release your rockets. Shall
I count?</i>"</p>

<p>Joe panted, "Count!"</p>

<p>The mechanical voice said, "<i>Seven ... six ... five ...
four ... three ... two ... one ... cut!</i>"</p>

<p>Joe pressed the release. The small, unburnt stubs of the
take-off rockets went hurtling off toward emptiness. They consumed
themselves as they went, and they attained an acceleration
of fifty gravities once they were relieved of all load
but their own substance. They had to be released lest one burn
longer than another. It was also the only way to stop acceleration
by solid-fuel rockets. They couldn't be extinguished. They
had to be released.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>From intolerably burdensome heaviness, there was abruptly
no weight at all in the ship. Joe's laboring heart beat twice
with the violence the weight had called for, though weight had
ended. It seemed to him that his skull would crack open during
those two heart-beats. Then he lay limply, resting.</p>

<p>There was a completely incredible stillness, for a time. The
four of them panted. Haney was better off than Joe, but the
Chief was harder hit. Mike's small body had taken the strain
best of all, and he would use the fact later in shrill argument
that midgets were designed by nature to be the explorers of
space for their bulkier and less spaceworthy kindred.</p>

<p>The ending of the steady, punishing drag was infinitely
good, but the new sensation was hardly pleasant. They had no
weight. It felt as if they and the ship about them were
falling together down an abyss which must have a bottom.
Actually, they were falling up. But they felt a physical, crawling
apprehension&mdash;a cringing from an imaginary imminent
impact.</p>

<p>They had expected the sensation, but it was not the better
for being understood. Joe flexed and unflexed his fingers
slowly. He stirred and swallowed hastily. But the feeling persisted.
He unstrapped himself from his seat. He stood up&mdash;and
floated to the ceiling of the cabin. But there was of course
no ceiling. Every way was up and every way was down. His
stomach cramped itself in a hard knot, in the instinctive tensity
of somebody in free fall.</p>

<p>He fended himself from the ceiling and caught at a hand-line
placed there for just this necessity to grip something. In
his absorption, he did not notice which way his heels went.
He suddenly noticed that his companions, with regard to him,
were upside down and staring at him with wooden, dazed expressions
on their faces.</p>

<p>He tried to laugh, and gulped instead. He pulled over to the
quartz-glass ports. He did not put his hand into the sunlight,
but shifted the glare shutters over those ports which admitted
direct sunshine. Some ports remained clear. Through one of
them he saw the Earth seemingly at arm's length somewhere
off. Not up, not down. Simply out from where he was. It filled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
all the space that the porthole showed. It was a gigantic mass
of white, fleecy specks and spots which would be clouds, and
between the whiteness there was a muddy dark greenish color
which would be the ocean. Yet it seemed to slide very, very
slowly past the window.</p>

<p>He saw a tanness between the clouds, and it moved inward
from the edge of his field of view. He suddenly realized what
it was.</p>

<p>"We've just about crossed the Atlantic," he said in a peculiar
astonishment. But it was true the ship had not been aloft
nearly as much as half an hour. "Africa's just coming into
sight below. We ought to be about 1,200 miles high and still
rising fast. That was the calculation."</p>

<p>He looked again, and then drew himself across to the opposite
porthole. He saw the blackness of space, which was not
blackness because it was a carpet of jewels. They were infinite
in number and variations in brightness, and somehow of vastly
more colorings than one noticed from Earth.</p>

<p>He heard the Chief grunt, and Haney gulp. He was suddenly
conscious that his legs were floating rather ridiculously
in mid-air with no particular relationship to anything. He saw
the Chief rise very cautiously, holding on to the arms of his
seat.</p>

<p>"Better not look at the sun," said Joe, "even though I've
put on the glare-shields."</p>

<p>The Chief nodded. The glare-shields would keep out most
of the heat and a very great deal of the ultraviolet the sun
gave off. But even so, to look at the sun directly might easily
result in a retinal sunburn which could result in blindness.</p>

<p>The loudspeaker behind Joe's chair clattered. It had seemed
muted by the weight of its diaphragm at three gravities. Now
it blasted unintelligibly, with no weight at all. Mike threw a
switch and took the message.</p>

<p>"Communications says radar says we're right on course,
Joe," he reported nonchalantly, "and our speed's okay. We'll
reach maximum altitude in an hour and thirty-six minutes. We
ought to be within calculated distance of the Platform then."</p>

<p>"Good," said Joe abstractedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>He strained his eyes at the Earth. They were moving at an
extraordinary speed and height. It had been reached by just
four human beings before them. The tannishness which was
the coast of Africa crept with astonishing slowness toward the
center of what he could see.</p>

<p>Joe headed back to his seat. He could not walk, of course.
He floated. He launched himself with a fine air of confidence.
He misjudged. He was floating past his chair when he reached
down&mdash;and that turned his body&mdash;and fumbled wildly. He
caught hold of the back as he went by, then held on and
found himself turning a grandly dignified somersault. He
wound up in a remarkably foolish position with the back of his
neck on the back of the chair, his arms in a highly strained
position to hold him there, and his feet touching the deck of
the cabin a good five feet away.</p>

<p>Haney looked greenish, but he said hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Joe, don't make me laugh&mdash;not when my stomach feels like
this!"</p>

<p>The feeling of weightlessness was unexpectedly daunting.
Joe turned himself about very slowly, with his legs floating indecorously
in entirely unintended kicks. He was breathing
hard when he pulled himself into the chair and strapped in
once more.</p>

<p>"I'll take Communications," he told Mike as he settled his
headphones.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Mike switched over.</p>

<p>"Kenmore reporting to Communications," he said briefly.
"We have ended our take-off acceleration. You have our course
and velocity. Our instruments read&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went over the bank of instruments before him, giving
the indication of each. In a sense, this first trip of a ship out
to the Platform had some of the aspects of defusing a bomb.
Calculations were useful, but observations were necessary. He
had to report every detail of the condition of his ship and
every instrument-reading because anything might go wrong,
and at any instant. Anything that went wrong could be fatal.
So every bit of data and every intended action needed to be on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
record. Then, if something happened, the next ship to attempt
this journey might avoid the same catastrophe.</p>

<p>Time passed. A lot of time. The feeling of unending fall
continued. They knew what it was, but they had to keep thinking
of its cause to endure it. Joe found that if his mind concentrated
fully on something else, it jerked back to panic and the
feel of falling. But the crew of the Space Platform&mdash;now out
in space for more weeks than Joe had been quarter-hours&mdash;reported
that one got partly used to it, in time. When awake, at
least. Asleep was another matter.</p>

<p>They were 1,600 miles high and still going out and up. The
Earth as seen through the ports was still an utterly monstrous,
bulging mass, specked with clouds above vast mottlings which
were its seas and land. They might have looked for cities, but
they would be mere patches in a telescope. Their task now was
to wait until their orbit curved into accordance with that of the
Platform and they kept their rendezvous. The artificial satellite
was swinging up behind them, and was only a quarter-circle
about Earth behind them. Their speed in miles per second
was, at the moment, greater than that of the Platform. But
they were climbing. They slowed as they climbed. When
their path intersected that of the Platform, the two velocities
should be exactly equal.</p>

<p>Major Holt's voice came on the Communicator.</p>

<p>"<i>Joe</i>," he said harshly, "<i>I have very bad news. A message
came from Central Intelligence within minutes of your take-off.
I&mdash;ah&mdash;with Sally I had been following your progress. I did not
decode the message until now. But Central Intelligence has
definite information that more than ten days ago the&mdash;ah&mdash;enemies
of our Space Exploration Project</i>&mdash;" even on a tight
beam to the small spaceship, Major Holt did not name the
nation everybody knew was most desperately resolved to
smash space exploration by anybody but itself&mdash;"<i>completed
at least one rocket capable of reaching the Platform's orbit
with a pay-load that could be an atomic bomb. It is believed
that more than one rocket was completed. All were shipped to
an unknown launching station.</i>"</p>

<p>"Not so good," said Joe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Mike had left his post when Joe took over. Now he made
a swooping dart through the air of the cabin. The midget
showed no signs of the fumbling uncertainty the others had
displayed&mdash;but he'd been a member of a midget acrobatic
team before he went to work at the Shed. He brought himself
to a stop precisely at a hand-hold, grinning triumphantly at
the nearly helpless Chief and Haney.</p>

<p>Major Holt said in the headphones: "<i>It's worse than that.
Radar may have told the country in question that you are on
the way up. In that case, if it's even faintly possible to blast
the Platform before your arrival with weapons for its defense,
they'll blast.</i>"</p>

<p>"I don't like that idea," said Joe dourly. "Anything we can
do?"</p>

<p>Major Holt laughed bitterly. "<i>Hardly!</i>" he said. "<i>And do you
realize that if you can't unload your cargo you can't get back to
Earth?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Joe. "Naturally!"</p>

<p>It was true. The purpose of the pushpots and the jatos and
the ship's own take-off rockets had been to give it a speed at
which it would inevitably rise to a height of 4,000 miles&mdash;the
orbit of the Space Platform&mdash;and stay there. It would need no
power to remain 4,000 miles out from Earth. But it would
take power to come down. The take-off rockets had been
built to drive the ship with all its contents until it attained
that needed orbital velocity. There were landing rockets fastened
to the hull now to slow it so that it could land. But just
as the take-off rockets had been designed to lift a loaded
ship, the landing-rockets had been designed to land an empty
one.</p>

<p>The more weight the ship carried, the more power it needed
to get out to the Platform. And the more power it needed to
come down again.</p>

<p>If Joe and his companions couldn't get rid of their cargo&mdash;and
they could only unload in the ship-lock of the Platform&mdash;they'd
stay out in emptiness.</p>

<p>The Major said bitterly: "<i>This is all most irregular, but&mdash;here's
Sally.</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Sally's voice sounded in the headphones Joe wore.
He was relieved that Mike wasn't acting as communications
officer at the moment to overhear. But Mike was zestfully
spinning like a pin-wheel in the middle of the air of the
control cabin. He was showing the others that even in the
intramural pastimes a spaceship crew will indulge in, a midget
was better than a full-sized man. Joe said:</p>

<p>"Yes, Sally?"</p>

<p>She said unsteadily. "<i>I'm not going to waste your time
talking to you, Joe. I think you've got to figure out something.
I haven't the faintest idea what it is, but I think you can do it.
Try, will you?</i>"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we're going to have to trust to luck," admitted
Joe ruefully. "We weren't equipped for anything like this."</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" said Sally fiercely. "<i>If I were with you, you wouldn't
think of trusting to luck!</i>"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to," admitted Joe. "I'd feel responsible.
But just the same&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>You're responsible now!</i>" said Sally, as fiercely as before.
"<i>If the Platform's smashed, the rockets that can reach it will
be duplicated to smash our cities in war! But if you can reach
the Platform and arm it for defense, there won't be any war!
Half the world would be praying for you, Joe, if it knew! I
can't do anything else, so I'm going to start on that right now.
But you try, Joe! You hear me?</i>"</p>

<p>"I'll try," said Joe humbly. "Thanks, Sally."</p>

<p>He heard a sound like a sob, and the headphones were
silent. Joe himself swallowed very carefully. It can be alarming
to be the object of an intended murder, but it can also
be very thrilling. One can play up splendidly to a dramatic
picture of doom. It is possible to be one's own audience and
admire one's own fine disregard of danger. But when other
lives depend on one, one has the irritating obligation not
to strike poses but to do something practical.</p>

<p>Joe said somberly: "Mike, how long before we ought to
contact the Platform?"</p>

<p>Mike reached out a small hand, caught a hand-hold, and
flicked his eyes to the master chronometer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forty minutes, fifty seconds. Why?"</p>

<p>Joe said wrily, "There are some rockets in enemy hands
which can reach the Platform. They were shipped to launchers
ten days ago. You figure what comes next."</p>

<p>Mike's wizened face became tense and angry. Haney
growled, "They smash the Platform before we get to it."</p>

<p>"Uh-uh!" said Mike instantly. "They smash the Platform
<i>when</i> we get to it! They smash us both up together. Where'll
we be at contact-time, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Over the Indian Ocean, south of the Bay of Bengal, to be
exact," said Joe. "But we'll be moving fast. The worst of it is
that it's going to take time to get in the airlock and unload
our guided missiles and get them in the Platform's launching-tubes.
I'd guess an hour. One bomb should get both of us
above the Bay of Bengal, but we won't be set to launch a
guided missile in defense until we're nearly over America
again."</p>

<p>The Chief said sourly, "Yeah. Sitting ducks all the way
across the Pacific!"</p>

<p>"We'll check with the Platform," said Joe. "See if you can
get them direct, Mike, will you?"</p>

<p>Then something occurred to him. Mike scrambled back to
his communication board. He began feverishly to work the
computer which in turn would swing the tight-beam transmitter
to the target the computer worked out, He threw a
switch and said sharply, "Calling Space Platform! Pelican
One calling Space Platform! Come in, Space Platform!..."
He paused. "Calling Space Platform...."</p>

<p>Joe had a slide-rule going on another problem. He looked
up, his expression peculiar.</p>

<p>"A solid-fuel rocket can start off at ten gravities acceleration,"
he said quietly, "and as its rockets burn away it can
go up a lot higher than that. But 4,000 miles is a long way
to go straight up. If it isn't launched yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mike snapped into a microphone: "Right!" To Joe he said,
"Space Platform on the wire."</p>

<p>Joe heard an acknowledgment in his headphones. "I've
just had word from the Shed," he explained carefully, "that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
there may be some guided missiles coming up from Earth
to smash us as we meet. You're still higher than we are,
and they ought to be starting. Can you pick up anything with
your radar?"</p>

<p>The voice from the Platform said: "<i>We have picked something
up. There are four rockets headed out from near the
sunset-line in the Pacific. Assuming solid-fuel rockets like we
used and you used, they are on a collision course.</i>"</p>

<p>"Are you doing anything about them?" asked Joe absurdly.</p>

<p>The voice said caustically: "<i>Unfortunately, we've nothing to
do anything with.</i>" It paused. "<i>You, of course, can use the
landing-rockets you still possess. If you fire them immediately,
you will pass our scheduled meeting-place some hundreds of
miles ahead of us. You will go on out to space. You may set
up an orbit forty-five hundred or even five thousand miles
out, and wait there for rescue.</i>"</p>

<p>Joe said briefly: "We've air for only four days. That's no
good. It'll be a month before the next ship can be finished
and take off. There are four rockets coming up, you say?"</p>

<p>"<i>Yes.</i>" The voice changed. It spoke away from the microphone.
"<i>What's that?</i>" Then it returned to Joe. "<i>The four
rockets were sent up at the same instant from four separate
launching sites. Probably as many submarines at the corners
of a hundred-mile square, so an accident to one wouldn't set
off the others. They'll undoubtedly converge as they get
nearer to us.</i>"</p>

<p>"I think," said Joe, "that we need some luck."</p>

<p>"<i>I think</i>," said the caustic voice, "<i>that we've run out of it.</i>"</p>

<p>There was a click. Joe swallowed again. The three members
of his crew were looking at him.</p>

<p>"Somebody's fired rockets out from Earth," said Joe carefully.
"They'll curve together where we meet the Platform,
and get there just when we do."</p>

<p>The Chief rumbled. Haney clamped his jaws together.
Mike's expression became one of blazing hatred.</p>

<p>Joe's mind went rather absurdly to the major's curious,
almost despairing talk in his quarters that morning, when
he'd spoken of a conspiracy to destroy all the hopes of men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
The firing of rockets at the Platform was, of course, the work
of men acting deliberately. But they were&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;trying
to destroy their own best hopes. For freedom, certainly,
whether or not they could imagine being free. But
the Platform and the space exploration project in general
meant benefits past computing for everybody, in time. To
send ships into space for necessary but dangerous experiments
with atomic energy was a purpose every man should
want to help forward. To bring peace on Earth was surely
an objective no man could willingly or sanely combat. And
the ultimate goal of space travel was millions of other planets,
circling other suns, thrown open to colonization by humanity.
That prospect should surely fire every human being with
enthusiasm. But something&mdash;and the more one thought about
it the more specific and deliberate it seemed to be&mdash;made
it necessary to fight desperately against men in order to benefit
them.</p>

<p>Joe swallowed again. It would have been comforting to be
dramatic in this war against stupidity and malice and blindness.
Especially since this particular battle seemed to be
lost. One could send back an eloquent, defiant message to
Earth saying that the four of them did not regret their journey
into space, though they were doomed to be killed by the
enemies of their country. It could have been a very pretty
gesture. But Joe happened to have a job to do. Pretty gestures
were not a part of it. He had no idea how to do it. So he said
rather sickishly:</p>

<p>"The Platform told me we could fire our landing-rockets
as additional take-off rockets and get out of the way. Of
course we've got missiles of our own on board, but we can't
launch or control them. Absolutely the only thing we can
choose to do or not do is fire those rockets. I'm open to suggestions
if anybody can think of a way to make them useful."</p>

<p>There was silence. Joe's reasoning was good enough. When
one can't do what he wants, one tries to make what he can
do produce the results he wants. But it didn't look too
promising here. They could fire the rockets now, or later,
or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>An idea came out of the blue. It wasn't a good idea, but
it was the only one possible under the circumstances. There
was just one distinctly remote possibility. He told the others
what it was. Mike's eyes flamed. The Chief nodded profoundly.
Haney said with some skepticism, "It's all we've got.
We've got to use it."</p>

<p>"I need some calculations. Spread. Best time of firing.
That sort of thing. But I'm worried about calling back in
the clear. A beam to the Platform will bounce and might be
picked up by the enemy."</p>

<p>The Chief grinned suddenly. "I've got a trick for that, Joe.
There's a tribesman of mine in the Shed. Get Charley Red
Fox to the phone, guy, and we'll talk privately!"</p>

<p>The small spaceship floated on upward. It pointed steadfastly
in the direction of its motion. The glaring sunshine
which at its take-off had shone squarely in its bow-ports,
now poured down slantingly from behind. The steel plates
of the ship gleamed brightly. Below it lay the sunlit Earth.
Above and about it on every hand were a multitude of stars.
Even the moon was visible as the thinnest of crescents against
the night of space.</p>

<p>The ship climbed steeply. It was meeting the Platform after
only half a circuit of Earth, while the Platform had climbed
upward for three full revolutions. Earth was now 3,000 miles
below and appeared as the most gigantic of possible solid
objects. It curved away and away to mistiness at its horizons,
and it moved visibly as the spaceship floated on.</p>

<p>Invisible microwaves flung arrowlike through emptiness.
They traveled for thousands of miles, spreading as they traveled,
and then struck the strange shape of the Platform. They
splashed from it. Some of them rebounded to Earth, where
spies and agents of foreign powers tried desperately to make
sense of the incredible syllables. They failed.</p>

<p>There was a relay system in operation now, from spaceship
to Platform to Earth and back again. In the ship Chief
Bender, Mohawk and steelman extraordinary, talked to the
Shed and to one Charley Red Fox. They talked in Mohawk,
which is an Algonquin Indian language, agglutinative, complicated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and not to be learned in ten easy lessons. It was not
a language which eavesdroppers were likely to know as a matter
of course. But it was a language by which computations
could be asked for, so that a very forlorn hope might be
attempted with the best possible chances of success.</p>

<p>Naturally, none of this appeared in the look of things. The
small ship floated on and on. It reached an altitude of 3,500
miles. The Earth was visibly farther away. Behind the ship
the Atlantic with its stately cloud-formations was sunlit to
the very edge of its being. Ahead, the edge of night appeared
beyond India. And above, the Platform appeared as
a speck of molten light, quarter-illuminated by the sun
above it.</p>

<p>Spaceship and Platform moved on toward a meeting place.
The ship moved a trifle faster, because it was climbing. The
speeds would match exactly when they met. The small torpedo-shaped
shining ship and the bulging glowing metal
satellite floated with a seeming vast deliberation in emptiness,
while the most gigantic of possible round objects filled all
the firmament beneath them. They were 200 miles apart. It
seemed that the huge Platform overtook the shining ship. It
did. They were only 50 miles apart and still closing in.</p>

<p>By that time the twilight band of Earth's surface was
nearly at the center of the planet, and night filled more than
a quarter of its disk.</p>

<p>By that time, too, even to the naked eye through the ports
of the supply-ship the enemy rockets had become visible.
They were a thin skein of threads of white vapor which
seemed to unravel in nothingness. The vapor curled and
expanded preposterously. It could just be seen to be jetting
into existence from four separate points, two a little ahead
of the others. They came out from Earth at a rate which
seemed remarkably deliberate until one saw with what fury
the rocket-fumes spat out to form the whitish threads. Then
one could guess at a three-or even four-stage launching series,
so that what appeared to be mere pinpoints would really be
rockets carrying half-ton atomic warheads with an attained
velocity of 10,000 miles per hour and more straight up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The threads unraveled in a straight line aimed at the two
metal things floating in emptiness. One was small and streamlined,
with inadequate landing-rockets clamped to its body
and with stubby fins that had no possible utility out of air.
The other was large and clumsy to look at, but very, very
stately indeed in its progress through the heavens. They
floated smoothly toward a rendezvous. The rockets from
Earth came ravening to destroy them at the instant of their
intersection.</p>

<p>The little spaceship turned slowly. Its rounded bow had
pointed longingly at the stars. Now it tilted downward. Its
direction of movement did not change, of course. In the
absence of air, it could tumble indefinitely without any ill
effect. It was in a trajectory instead of on a course, though
presently the trajectory would become an orbit. But it pointed
nose-down toward the Earth even as it continued to hurtle
onward.</p>

<p>The great steel hull and the small spaceship were 20 miles
apart. An infinitesimal radar-bowl moved on the little ship.
Tight-beam waves flickered invisibly between the two craft.
The rockets raged toward them.</p>

<p>The ship and the Platform were 10 miles apart. The rockets
were now glinting missiles leaping ahead of the fumes that
propelled them.</p>

<p>The ship and the Platform were two miles apart. The
rockets rushed upward.... There were minute corrections
in their courses. They converged....</p>

<p>Flames leaped from the tiny ship. Its landing-rockets
spouted white-hot flame and fumes more thick and coiling
than even the smoke of the bombs. The little ship surged
momentarily toward the racing monsters. And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The rockets which were supposed to let the ship down to
Earth flew free&mdash;flung themselves unburdened at the rockets
which came with deadly intent to the meeting of the two
Earth spacecraft.</p>

<p>The landing-rockets plunged down at forty gravities or
better. They were a dwindling group of infinitely bright sparks
which seemed to group themselves more closely as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
dwindled. They charged upon the attacking robot things.
They were unguided, of necessity, but the robot bombs had
to be equipped with proximity fuses. No remote control
could be so accurate as to determine the best moment for
detonation at 4,000 miles' distance. So the war rockets had
to be devised to explode when near anything which reflected
their probing radar waves. They had to be designed to be
triggered by anything in space.</p>

<p>And the loosed landing-rockets plunged among them.</p>

<p>They did not detonate all at once. That was mathematically
impossible. But no human eye could detect the delay. Four
close-packed flares of pure atomic fire sprang into being between
the Platform and Earth. Each was brighter than the
sun. For the fraction of an instant there was no night where
night had fallen on the Earth. For thousands of miles the
Earth glowed brightly.</p>

<p>Then there was a twisting, coiling tumult of incandescent
gases, which were snatched away by nothingness and ceased
to be.</p>

<p>Then there were just two things remaining in the void. One
was the great, clumsy, shining Platform, gigantic in size to
anything close by. The other was the small spaceship which
had climbed to it and fought for it and defended it against
the bombs from Earth.</p>

<p>The little ship now had a slight motion away from the
Platform, due to the instant's tugging by its rockets before
they were released.</p>

<p>It turned about in emptiness. Its steering-rockets spouted
smoke. It began to cancel out its velocity away from the Platform,
and to swim slowly and very carefully toward it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="c3" id="c3"></a><i>3</i></h2>


<p>Making actual contact with the platform was
not a matter for instruments and calculations. It had to be
done directly&mdash;by hand, as it were. Joe watched out the ports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and played the controls of the steering jets with a nerve-racked
precision. His task was not easy.</p>

<p>Before he could return to the point of rendezvous, the blinding
sunlight on the Platform took on a tinge of red. It was the
twilight-zone of the satellite's orbit, when for a time the
sunlight that reached it was light which had passed through
Earth's atmosphere and been bent by it and colored crimson
by the dust in Earth's air. It glowed a fiery red, and the color
deepened, and then there was darkness.</p>

<p>They were in Earth's shadow. There were stars to be seen,
but no sun. The Moon was hidden, too. And the Earth was a
monstrous, incredible, abysmal blackness which at this first
experience of its appearance produced an almost superstitious
terror. Formerly it had seemed a distant but sunlit world,
flecked with white clouds and with sprawling differentiations
of color beneath them.</p>

<p>Now it did not look like a solid thing at all. It looked like
a hole in creation. One could see ten thousand million stars
of every imaginable tint and shade. But where the Earth
should be there seemed a vast nothingness. It looked like an
opening to annihilation. It looked like the veritable Pit of
Darkness which is the greatest horror men have ever imagined,
and since those in the ship were without weight it
seemed that they were falling into it.</p>

<p>Joe knew better, of course. So did the others. But that was
the look of things, and that was the feeling. One did not feel
in danger of death, but of extinction&mdash;which, in cold fact, is
very much worse.</p>

<p>Lights glowed on the outside of the Platform to guide the
supply ship to it. There were red and green and blue and
harsh blue-white electric bulbs. They were bright and distinct,
but the feeling of loneliness above that awful appearance
of the Pit was appalling. No small child alone at
night had ever so desolate a sensation of isolation as the
four in the small ship.</p>

<p>But Joe painstakingly played the buttons of the steering-rocket
control board. The ship surged, and turned, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
surged forward again. Mike, at the communicator, said, "They
say slow up, Joe."</p>

<p>Joe obeyed, but he was tense. Haney and the Chief were
at other portholes, looking out. The Chief said heavily,
"Fellas, I'm going to admit I never felt so lonesome in my
life!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad I've got you fellows with me!" Haney admitted
guiltily.</p>

<p>"The job's almost over," said Joe.</p>

<p>The ship's own hull, outside the ports, glowed suddenly
in a light-beam from the Platform. The small, brief surges
of acceleration which sent the ship on produced tremendous
emotional effects. When the Platform was only one mile
away, Haney switched on the ship's searchlights. They
stabbed through emptiness with absolutely no sign of their
existence until they touched the steel hull of the satellite.</p>

<p>Mike said sharply: "Slow up some more, Joe."</p>

<p>He obeyed again. It would not be a good idea to ram the
Platform after they had come so far to reach it.</p>

<p>They drifted slowly, slowly, slowly toward it. The monstrous
Pit of Darkness which was the night side of Earth
seemed almost about to engulf the Platform. They were a few
hundred feet higher than the great metal globe, and the
blackness was behind it. They were a quarter of a mile away.
The distance diminished.</p>

<p>A thin straight line seemed to grow out toward them. There
was a small, bulb-like object at its end. It reached out farther
than was at all plausible. Nothing so slender should
conceivably reach so far without bending of its own weight.
But of course it had no weight here. It was a plastic flexible
hose with air pressure in it. It groped for the spaceship.</p>

<p>The four in the ship held their breaths.</p>

<p>There was a loud, metallic <i>clank!</i></p>

<p>Then it was possible to feel the ship being pulled toward
the Platform by the magnetic grapple. It was a landing-line.
It was the means by which the ship would be docked in the
giant lock which had been built to receive it.</p>

<p>As they drew near, they saw the joints of the plating of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the Platform. They saw rivets. There was the huge, 30-foot
doorway with its valves swung wide. Their searchlight beam
glared into it. They saw the metal floor, and the bulging
plastic sidewalls, restrained by nets. They saw the inner lock-door.
It seemed that men should be visible to welcome them.
There were none.</p>

<p>The airlock swallowed them. They touched against something
solid. There were more clankings. They seemed to
crunch against the metal floor&mdash;magnetic flooring-grapples.
Then, in solid contact with the substance of the Platform,
they heard the sounds of the great outer doors swinging
shut. They were within the artificial satellite of Earth. It
was bright in the lock, and Joe stared out the cabin ports
at the quilted sides. There was a hissing of air, and he saw
a swirling mist, and then the bulges of the sidewall sagged.
The air pressure gauge was spinning up toward normal sea-level
air pressure.</p>

<p>Joe threw the ready lever of the steering rockets to <i>Off</i>.
"We're landed."</p>

<p>There was silence. Joe looked about him. The other three
looked queer. It would have seemed natural for them to rejoice
on arriving at their destination. But somehow they
didn't feel that they had.</p>

<p>Joe said wrily, "It seems that we ought to weigh something,
now we've got here. So we feel queer that we don't. Shoes,
Mike?"</p>

<p>Mike peeled off the magnetic-soled slippers from their
place on the cabin wall. He handed them out and opened
the door. A biting chill came in it. Joe slipped on the shoe-soles
with their elastic bands to hold them. He stepped out
the door.</p>

<p>He didn't land. He floated until he reached the sidewall.
Then he pulled himself down by the netting. Once he
touched the floor, his shoes seemed to be sticky. The net
and the plastic sidewalls were, of course, the method by which
a really large airlock was made practical. When this ship was
about to take off again, pumps would not labor for hours to
pump the air out. The sidewalls would inflate and closely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
enclose the ship's hull, and so force the air in the lock back
into the ship. Then the pumps would work on the air behind
the inflated walls&mdash;with nets to help them draw the wall-stuff
back to let the ship go free. The lock could be used with
only fifteen minutes for pumping instead of four hours.</p>

<p>The door in the back of the lock clanked open. Joe tried
to walk toward it. He discovered his astounding clumsiness.
To walk in magnetic-soled shoes in weightlessness requires
a knack. When Joe lifted one foot and tried to swing the
other forward, his body tried to pivot. When he lifted his
right foot, he had to turn his left slightly inward. His arms
tried to float absurdly upward. When he was in motion and
essayed to pause, his whole body tended to continue forward
with a sedate toppling motion that brought him down flat
on his face. He had to put one foot forward to check himself.
He seemed to have no sense of balance. When he stood
still&mdash;his stomach queasy because of weightlessness&mdash;he found
himself tilting undignifiedly forward or back&mdash;or, with equal
unpredictability, sidewise. He would have to learn an entirely
new method of walking.</p>

<p>A man came in the lock, and Joe knew who it was. Sanford,
the senior scientist of the Platform's crew. Joe had seen him
often enough on the television screen in the Communications
Room at the Shed. Now Sanford looked nerve-racked,
but his eyes were bright and his expression sardonic.</p>

<p>"My compliments," he said, his voice tight with irony, "for
a splendidly futile job well done! You've got your cargo
invoice?"</p>

<p>Joe nodded. Sanford held out his hand. Joe fumbled in his
pocket and brought out the yellow sheet.</p>

<p>"I'd like to introduce my crew," said Joe. "This is Haney,
and Chief Bender, and Mike Scandia." He waved his hand,
and his whole body wobbled unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"We'll know each other!" said Sanford sardonically. "Our
first job is more futility&mdash;to get the guided missiles you've
brought us into the launching tubes. A lot of good they'll do!"</p>

<p>A huge plate in the roof of the lock&mdash;but it was not up
or down or in any particular direction&mdash;withdrew itself. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
man floated through the opening and landed on the ship's
hull; another man followed him.</p>

<p>"Chief," said Joe, "and Haney. Will you open the cargo
doors?"</p>

<p>The two swaying figures moved to obey, though with erratic
clumsiness. Sanford called sharply: "Don't touch the hull without
gloves! If it isn't nearly red-hot from the sunlight, it'll be
below zero from shadow!"</p>

<p>Joe realized, then, the temperature effects the skin on his
face noticed. A part of the spaceship's hull gave off heat like
that of a panel heating installation. Another part imparted
a chill.</p>

<p>Sanford said unpleasantly, "You want to report your
heroism, eh? Come along!"</p>

<p>He clanked to the doorway by which he had entered. Joe
followed, and Mike after him.</p>

<p>They went out of the lock. Sanford suddenly peeled off
his metal-soled slippers, put them in his pocket, and dived
casually into a four-foot metal tube. He drifted smoothly
away along the lighted bore, not touching the sidewalls. He
moved in the manner of a dream, when one floats with infinite
ease and precision in any direction one chooses.</p>

<p>Joe and Mike did not share his talent. Joe launched himself
after Sanford, and for perhaps 20 or 30 feet the lighted
aluminum sidewall of the tube sped past him. Then his
shoulder rubbed, and he found himself skidding to an undignified
stop, choking the bore. Mike thudded into him.</p>

<p>"I haven't got the hang of this yet," said Joe apologetically.</p>

<p>He untangled himself and went on. Mike followed him,
his expression that of pure bliss. He was a tiny man, was Mike,
but he had the longings and the ambitions of half a dozen
ordinary-sized men in his small body. And he had known
frustration. He could prove by mathematics that space exploration
could be carried on by midgets at a fraction of the
cost and risk of the same job done by normal-sized men.
He was, of course, quite right. The cabins and air and food
supplies for a spaceship's crew of midgets would cost and
weigh a fraction of similar equipment for six-footers. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
people simply weren't interested in sending midgets out
into space.</p>

<p>But Mike had gotten here. He was in the Space Platform.
There were full-sized men who would joyfully have changed
places with him, forty-one inch height and all. So Mike was
blissful.</p>

<p>The tube ended and Joe bounced off the wall that faced
its end. Sanford was waiting. He grinned with more than a
hint of spite.</p>

<p>"Here's our communications room," he said. "Now you
can talk down to Earth. It'll be relayed, now, but in half an
hour you can reach the Shed direct."</p>

<p>He floated inside. Joe followed cautiously. There was
another crew member on duty there. He sat before a group
of radar screens, with thigh grips across his legs to hold
him in his chair. He turned his head and nodded cheerfully
enough.</p>

<p>"Here!" snapped Sanford.</p>

<p>Joe clambered awkwardly to the seat the senior crew member
pointed out. He made his way to it by handholds on the
walls. He fumbled into the chair and threw over the curved
thigh grips that would hold him in place.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was oriented. He had seen this room before&mdash;before
the Platform was launched. True, the man at the
radar screens was upside-down with reference to himself,
and Sanford had hooked a knee negligently around the arm
of a firmly anchored chair with his body at right angles to
Joe's own, but at least Joe knew where he was and what
he was to do.</p>

<p>"Go ahead and report," said Sanford sardonically. "You
might tell them that you heroically destroyed the rockets
that attacked us, and that your crew behaved splendidly, and
that you have landed in the Space Platform and the situation
is well in hand. It isn't, but it will make nice headlines."</p>

<p>Joe said evenly, "Our arrival's been reported?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sanford, grinning. "Obviously the radar down
on Earth&mdash;shipboard ones on this hemisphere, of course&mdash;have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
reported that the Platform still exists. But we haven't
communicated since the bombs went off. They probably
think we had so many punctures that we lost all our air
and are all wiped out. They'll be glad to hear from you that
we aren't."</p>

<p>Joe threw a switch, frowning. This wasn't right. Sanford
was the senior scientist on board and hence in command,
because he was best-qualified to direct the scientific observations
the Platform was making. But there was something
specifically wrong.</p>

<p>The communicator hummed. A faint voice sounded. It
swelled to loudness. "Calling Space Platform! <i>Calling Space
Platform!</i> <span class="smcap">CALLING SPACE PLATFORM</span>!" Joe turned down the
volume. He said into the microphone:</p>

<p>"Space Platform calling Earth. Joe Kenmore reporting. We
have made contact with the Platform and completed our
landing. Our cargo is now being unloaded. Our landing rockets
had to be expended against presumably hostile bombs, and
we are now unable to return to Earth. The ship and the
Platform, however, are unharmed. I am now waiting for
orders. Report ends."</p>

<p>He turned away from the microphone. Sanford said sharply,
"Go on! Tell them what a hero you are!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to help unload my ship," Joe said shortly. "You
report what you please."</p>

<p>"Get back at that transmitter!" shouted Sanford furiously.
"Tell 'em you're a hero! Tell 'em you're wonderful! I'll tell
'em how useless it is!"</p>

<p>Joe saw the other man in the room, the man at the radar
screens, shake his head. He got up and fumbled his way along
the wall to the door. Sanford shouted after him angrily.</p>

<p>Joe went out, found the four-foot tunnel, and floated not
down but along it back to the unloading lock. Wordlessly,
he set to work to get the cargo out of the cargo hold of the
spaceship.</p>

<p>Handling objects in weightlessness which on Earth would
be heavy was an art in itself. Two men could move tons.
It needed only one man to start a massive crate in motion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
However, one had either to lift or push an object in the exact
line it was to follow. To thrust hard for a short time produced
exactly the same effect as to push gently for a longer period.
Anything floated tranquilly in the line along which it was
moved. The man who had to stop it, though, needed to use
exactly as much energy as the man who sent it floating. He
needed to check the floating thing in exactly the same line.
If one tried to stop a massive shipment from one side, he
would topple into it and he and the crate together would go
floundering helplessly over each other.</p>

<p>The Chief had gone off to help maneuver two-ton guided
missiles into launching tubes. One crew member remained
with Haney, unloading things that would have had to be
handled with cranes on Earth. Joe found himself needed most
in the storage chamber. A crate floated from the ship to the
crewman. Standing head downward, he stopped its original
movement, braced himself, and sent it floating to Joe. He
braced himself, stopped its flight, and very slowly&mdash;to move
fast with anything heavy in his hands would pull his feet
from the floor&mdash;set it on a stack of similar objects which
would presently be fastened in place.</p>

<p>Everything had to be done in slow motion, or one would
lose his footing. Joe worked painstakingly. He gradually
began to understand the process. But the muscles of his
stomach ached because of their continuous, instinctive cramp
due to the sensation of unending fall.</p>

<p>Mike floated through the hatchway from the lock. He
twisted about as he floated, and his magnetized soles clanked
to a deft contact with the wall. He said calmly: "That guy
Sanford has cracked up. He's potty. If this were jail he'd be
stir-crazy. He's yelling into the communicator now that we'll
all be dead in a matter of days, and the rocket missiles we
brought up won't help. He's nasty about it, too!"</p>

<p>Haney called from the cargo space of the ship in the lock:
"All empty here! We're unloaded."</p>

<p>There were sounds as he closed the cargo doors. Haney,
followed by the Chief, came into view, floating as Mike had
done. But he didn't land as skillfully. He touched the wall on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
his hands and knees and bounced away and tried helplessly
to swim to a hand-hold. It would have been funny except that
Joe was in no mood for humor.</p>

<p>Mike whipped off his belt and flipped the end of it to
Haney. He caught it and was drawn gently to the wall.
Haney's shoes clicked to a hold. The Chief landed more
expertly.</p>

<p>"We need wings here," he said ruefully. "You reported,
Joe?"</p>

<p>Joe nodded. He turned to Brent, the crew member who'd
been unloading. He knew him too, from their two-way video
conversations.</p>

<p>"Sanford does act oddly," he said uncomfortably. "When
he met me in the lock he said our coming was useless. He
talked about the futility of everything while I reported. He
sounds like he sneers at every possible action as useless."</p>

<p>"Most likely it is," Brent said mildly. "Here, anyhow. It
does look as if we're going to be knocked off. But Sanford's
taking it badly. The rest of us have let him act as he pleased
because it didn't seem to matter. It probably doesn't, except
that he's annoying."</p>

<p>Mike said truculently, "We won't be knocked off! We've
got rockets of our own up here now! We can fight back if
there's another attack!"</p>

<p>Brent shrugged. His face was young enough, but deeply
lined. He said as mildly as before: "Your landing rockets set
off four bombs on the way from Earth. You brought us six
more rocket missiles. How many bombs can we knock down
with them?"</p>

<p>Joe blinked. It was a shock to realize the facts of life in an
artificial satellite. If it could be reached by bombs from
Earth, the bombs could be reached by guided missiles from
the satellite. But it would take one guided missile to knock
down one bomb&mdash;with luck.</p>

<p>"I see," said Joe slowly. "We can handle just six more
bombs from Earth."</p>

<p>"Six in the next month," agreed Brent wrily. "It'll be that
long before we get more. Somebody sent up four bombs today.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Suppose they send eight next time? Or simply one a day
for a week?"</p>

<p>Mike made an angry noise. "The seventh bomb shot at us
knocks us out! We're sitting ducks here too!"</p>

<p>Brent nodded. He said mildly:</p>

<p>"Yes. The Platform can't be defended against an indefinite
number of bombs from Earth. Of course the United States
could go to war because we've been shot at. But would that do
us any good? We'd be shot down in the war."</p>

<p>Joe said distastefully, "And Sanford's cracked up because
he knows he's going to be killed?"</p>

<p>Brent said earnestly. "Oh, no! He's a good scientist! But he's
always had a brilliant mind. Poor devil, he's never failed at
anything in all his life until now! Now he <i>has</i> failed. He's
going to be killed, and he can't think of any way to stop it.
His brains are the only things he's ever believed in, and now
they're no good. He can't accept the idea that he's stupid, so
he has to believe that everything else is. It's a necessity for
him. Haven't you known people who had to think everybody
else was stupid to keep from knowing that they were themselves?"</p>

<p>Joe nodded. He waited.</p>

<p>"Sanford," said Brent earnestly, "simply can't adjust to the
discovery that he's no better than anybody else. That's all.
He was a nice guy, but he's not used to frustration and he can't
take it. Therefore he scorns everything that frustrates him&mdash;and
everything else, by necessity. He'll be scornful about getting
killed when it happens. But waiting for it is becoming
intolerable to him."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. He said apologetically, "I'm the
crew psychologist. That's why I speak so firmly. In five minutes
we're due to come out of the Earth's shadow into sunshine
again. I'd suggest that you come to watch. It's good to look
at."</p>

<p>He did not wait for an answer. He led the way. And the
others followed in a strange procession. Somehow, automatically,
they fell into single file, and they moved on their
magnetic-soled slippers toward a passage tube in one wall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Their slipper soles clanked and clicked in an erratic rhythm.
Brent walked with the mincing steps necessary for movement
in weightlessness. The others imitated him. Their hands no
longer hung naturally by their sides, but tended to make extravagant
gestures with the slightest muscular impulse. They
swayed extraordinarily as they walked. Brent was a slender
figure, and Joe was more thick-set, and Haney was taller, and
lean. The burly Chief and the forty-one inch figure of Mike
the midget followed after them. They made a queer procession
indeed.</p>

<p>Minutes later they were in a blister on the skin of the
Platform. There were quartz glass ports in the sidewall. Outside
the glass were metal shutters. Brent served out dense
goggles, almost black, and touched the buttons that opened
the steel port coverings.</p>

<p>They looked into space. The dimmer stars were extinguished
by the goggles they wore. The brighter ones seemed faint and
widely spaced. Beneath their feet as they held to handrails
lay the featureless darkness of Earth. But before them and
very far away there was a vast, dim arch of deepest red.</p>

<p>It was sunlight filtered through the thickest layers of Earth's
air. It barely outlined the curve of that gigantic globe. As they
stared, it grew brighter. The artificial satellite required little
more than four hours for one revolution about its primary, the
Earth. To those aboard it, the Earth would go through all its
phases in no longer a time. They saw now the thinnest possible
crescent of the new Earth. But in minutes&mdash;almost in
seconds&mdash;the deep red sunshine brightened to gold. The hair-thin
line of light widened to a narrow ribbon which described
an eight-thousand-mile half-circle. It brightened markedly at
the middle. It remained red at its ends, but in the very center
it glowed with splendid flame. Then a golden ball appeared,
and swam up and detached itself from the Earth, and the on-lookers
saw the breath-taking spectacle of all of Earth's surface
seemingly being born of the night.</p>

<p>As if new-created before their eyes, seas and lands unfolded
in the sunlight. They watched flecks of cloud and the long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
shadows of mountains, and the strangely different colorings
of its fields and forests.</p>

<p>As Brent had told them, it was good to watch.</p>

<p>It was half an hour later when they gathered in the kitchen
of the Platform. The man who had been loading launching
tubes now briskly worked to prepare a meal on the extremely
unusual cooking-devices of a human outpost in interplanetary
space.</p>

<p>The food smelled good. But Joe noticed that he could smell
growing things. Green stuff. It was absurd&mdash;until he remembered
that there was a hydroponic garden here. Plants grew
in it under sunlamps which were turned on for a certain number
of hours every day. The plants purified the Platform's air,
and of course provided some fresh and nourishing food for
the crew.</p>

<p>They ate. The food was served in plastic bowls, with elastic
thread covers through which they could see and choose the
particular morsels they fancied next. The threads stretched
to let through the forks they ate with. But Brent used a rather
more practical pair of tongs in a businesslike manner.</p>

<p>They drank coffee from cups which looked very much like
ordinary cups on Earth. Joe remembered suddenly that Sally
Holt had had much to do with the design of domestic science
arrangements here. He regarded his cup with interest. It
stayed in its saucer because of magnets in both plastic articles.
The saucer stayed on the table because the table was magnetic,
too. And the coffee did not float out to mid-air in a hot,
round brownish ball, because there was a transparent cover
over the cup. When one put his lips to the proper edge, a
part of the cover yielded as the cup was squeezed. The far
side of the cup was flexible. One pressed, and the coffee came
into one's lips without the spilling of a drop.</p>

<p>At that moment Joe really thought of Sally for the first time
in a good two hours. She'd been anxious that living in the
Platform should be as normal and Earth-like as possible. The
total absence of weight would be bad enough. She believed
it needed to be countered, as a psychological factor in staying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
sane, by the effect of normal-seeming chairs and normal-tasting
food, and not too exotic systems for eating.</p>

<p>Joe asked Brent about it.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Brent mildly. "It's likely we'd all have gone
off the deep end if there weren't some familiar things about.
To have to drink from a cup that one squeezes is tolerable.
But we'd have felt hysterical at times if we had to drink everything
from the equivalent of baby bottles."</p>

<p>"Sally Holt," said Joe, "is a friend of mine. She helped design
this stuff."</p>

<p>"That girl has every ounce of brains that any woman can be
trusted with!" Brent said warmly. "She thought of things that
would never have occurred to me! As a psychologist, I could
see how good her ideas were when she brought them up, but
as a male I'd never have dreamed of them." Then he grinned.
"She fell down on just one point. So did everybody else. Nobody
happened to think of a garbage-disposal system for the
Platform."</p>

<p>It came into Joe's mind that garbage-disposal was hardly a
subject one would expect to be discussing in interplanetary
space. But the Platform wasn't the same thing as a spaceship.
A ship could jettison refuse and leave it behind, or store it
during a voyage and dump it at either end. But the Space
Platform would never land. It could roll on forever. And if
it heaved out its refuse from airlocks&mdash;why&mdash;the stuff would
still have the Platform's orbital speed and would follow it
tirelessly around the Earth until the end of time.</p>

<p>"We dry and store it now," said Brent. "If we were going
to live, we'd figure out some way to turn it to fertilizer for
the hydroponic gardens. It's hardly worth while as things are.
Even then, though, the problem of tin cans could be hopeless."</p>

<p>The Chief wiped his mouth deliberately. He had helped
load four guided-missile launching tubes, and he had been
brought up to date on the state of things in the Platform. He
growled in a preliminary fashion and said, "Joe."</p>

<p>Joe looked at him.</p>

<p>"We brought up six two-ton guided missiles," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Chief dourly. "We'll have warning of other bombs coming up.
We can send these missiles out to intercept 'em. Six of 'em.
They can get close enough to set off their proximity fuses,
anyhow. But what are we going to do, Joe, if somebody flings
seven bombs at us? We can manage six&mdash;maybe. But what'll
we do with the one that's left over?"</p>

<p>"Have you any ideas?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>The Chief shook his head. Brent said mildly. "We've worked
on that here in the Platform, I assure you. And as Sanford
puts it quite soundly, about the only thing we can really do
is throw our empty tin cans at them."</p>

<p>Joe nodded. Then he tensed. Brent had meant it as a rather
mirthless joke. But Joe was astonished at what his own brain
made of it. He thought it over. Then he said, "Why not? It
ought to be a very good trick."</p>

<p>Brent stared at him incredulously. Haney looked solemnly at
him. The Chief regarded Joe thoughtfully out of the corner
of his eye. Then Mike shouted gleefully. The Chief blinked,
and a moment later grunted wrathful unintelligible syllables
of Mohawk, and then tried to pound Joe on the back and
because of his want of weight went head over heels into the
air between the six walls of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Haney said disgustedly, "Joe, there are times when a guy
wants to murder you! Why didn't I think of that?"</p>

<p>But Brent was looking at the four of them with a lively,
helpless curiosity. "Will you guys let me in on this?"</p>

<p>They told him. Joe began to explain it carefully, but the
Chief broke in with a barked and impatient description, and
then Mike interrupted to snap a correction. But by that time
Brent's expression had changed with astonishing suddenness.</p>

<p>"I see! I see!" he said excitedly. "All right! Have you got
space suits in your ship? We have them. So we'll go out and
pelt the stars with garbage. I think we'd better get at it right
now, too. In under two hours we'll be a fine target for more
bombs, and it would be good to start ahead of time."</p>

<p>Mike made a gesture and went floating out of the kitchen,
air-swimming to go get space suits from the ship. The grin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
on his small face threatened to cut his throat. Joe asked,
"Sanford's in command. How'll he like this idea?"</p>

<p>Brent hesitated. "I'm afraid," he said regretfully, "he won't
like it. If you solve a problem he gave up, it will tear his
present adjustment to bits. He's gone psychotic. I think,
though, that he'll allow it to be tried while he swears at us
for fools. He's most likely to react that way if you suggest it."</p>

<p>"Then," agreed Joe, "I suggest it. Chief&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chief raised a large brown hand.</p>

<p>"I got the program, Joe," he said. "We'll all get set."</p>

<p>And Joe went floating unhappily through passage-tubes
to the control room. He heard Sanford's voice, sardonic and
mocking, as he reached the communications room door.</p>

<p>"What do you expect?" Sanford was saying derisively.
"We're clay pigeons. We're a perfect target. We've just so
much ammunition now. You say you may send us more in
three weeks instead of a month. I admire your persistence,
but it's really no use! This is all a very stupid business...."</p>

<p>He felt Joe's presence. He turned, and then sharply struck
the communicator switch with the heel of his hand. The
image on the television screen died. The voice cut off. He said
blandly: "Well?"</p>

<p>"I want," said Joe, "to take a garbage-disposal party out on
the outside of the Platform. I came to ask for authority."</p>

<p>Sanford looked at him in mocking surprise.</p>

<p>"To be sure it seems as intelligent as anything else the
human race has ever done," he observed. "But why does it
appeal to you as something you want to do?"</p>

<p>"I think," Joe told him, "that we can make a defense against
bombs from Earth with our empty tin cans."</p>

<p>Sanford raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"If you happen to have a four-leaf clover with you," he said
in fine irony, "I'm told they're good, too."</p>

<p>His eyes were bright and scornful. His manner was feverishly
derisive. Joe would have done well to let it go at that.
But he was nettled.</p>

<p>"We set off the last bombs," he said doggedly, "by shooting
our landing rockets at them. They didn't collide with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
bombs. They simply touched off the bombs' proximity fuses.
If we surround the Platform with a cluster of tin cans and
such things, they may do as well. Things we throw away won't
drop to Earth. Ultimately, they'll actually circle us, like satellites
themselves. But if we can get enough of them between
us and Earth, any bombs that come up will have their proximity
fuses detonated by the floating trash we throw out."</p>

<p>Sanford laughed.</p>

<p>"We might ask for aluminum-foil ribbon to come up in the
next supply ship," said Joe. "We could have masses of that,
or maybe metallic dust floating around us."</p>

<p>"I much prefer used tin cans," said Sanford humorously.
"I'll take the watch here and let everybody go out with you.
By all means we must defend ourselves. Forward with the
garbage! Go ahead!"</p>

<p>His eyes were almost hysterically scornful as he waited for
Joe to leave. Joe did not like it at all, but there was nothing
to do but get out.</p>

<p>He found the Chief with a net bag filled with emptied tin
cans. Haney had another. There were two more, carried by
members of the Platform's four-man crew. They were donning
their space suits when Joe came upon them. Mike was
grotesque in the cut-down outfit built for him. Actually, the
only difference was in the size of the fabric suit and the length
of the arms and legs. He could carry a talkie outfit with its
batteries, and the oxygen tank for breathing as well as anybody,
since out here weight did not count at all. There were
plastic ropes, resistant to extremes of temperature.</p>

<p>Joe got into his own space suit. It was no such self-contained
space craft in itself as the fantastic story tellers dreamed of.
It was not much more than an altitude suit, aluminized to
withstand the blazing heat of sunshine in emptiness, and
with extravagantly insulated soles to the magnetic boots. In
theory, there simply is no temperature in space. In practice, a
metal hull heats up in sunshine to very much more than any
record-hot-day temperature on Earth. In shadow, too, a metal
hull will drop very close to minus 250 degrees Centigrade,
which is something like 400 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
But mainly the space boots were insulated against the almost
dull-red-heat temperatures of long-continued sunshine.</p>

<p>A crewman named Corey moved into an airlock with one
of the bags of empty tin cans. Brent watched in a routine
fashion through a glass in the lock-door. The pumps began to
exhaust the air from the airlock. Corey's space suit inflated
visibly. Presently the pump stopped. Corey opened the outer
door. He went out, paying plastic rope behind him. An instant
later he reappeared and removed the rope. He'd made
his line fast outside. He closed the outer lock-door. Air surged
into the lock and Haney crowded in. Again the pumping.
Then Haney went out, and was anchored to the Platform not
only by his magnetic boots but by a rope fastened to a hand-hold.
Brent went out. Mike. Joe came next.</p>

<p>They stood on the hull of the Space Platform, waiting in
the incredible harsh sunshine of emptiness. The bright steel
plates of the hull swelled and curved away on every hand.
There were myriads of stars and the vast round bulk of Earth
seemed farther away to a man in a space suit than to a man
looking out a port. Where shadows cut across the Platform's
irregular surface, there was utter blackness. Also there was
horrible frigidity. Elsewhere it was blindingly bright. The
men were specks of humanity standing on a shining metal
hull, and all about them there was the desolation of nothingness.</p>

<p>But Joe felt strangely proud. The seventh man came out of
the lock-door. They tied their plastic ropes together and
spread out in a long line which went almost around the
Platform. The man next to the lock was anchored to a steel
hand-hold. The third man of the line also anchored himself.
The fifth. The seventh. They were a straggling line of figures
with impossibly elongated shadows, held together by ropes.
They were peculiarly like a party of weirdly costumed mountaineers
on a glacier of gleaming silver.</p>

<p>But no mountain climbers ever had a background of ten
thousand million stars, peering up from below them as well as
from overhead. Nor did any ever have a mottled greenish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
planet rolling by 4,000 miles beneath them, nor a blazing sun
glaring down at them from a sky such as this.</p>

<p>In particular, perhaps, no other explorers ever set out upon
an expedition whose purpose was to throw tin cans and dried
refuse at all the shining cosmos.</p>

<p>They set to work. The space suits were inevitably clumsy.
It was not easy to throw hard with only magnetism to hold
one to his feet. It was actually more practical to throw straight
up with an underhand gesture. But even that would send the
tin cans an enormous distance, in time. There was no air to
slow them.</p>

<p>The tin cans twinkled as they left the Platform's steel expanse.
They moved away at a speed of possibly 20 to 30
miles an hour. They floated off in all possible directions. They
would never reach Earth, of course. They shared the Platform's
orbital speed, and they would circle the Earth with
it forever. But when they were thrown away, their orbits were
displaced a little. Each can thrown downward just now, for
example, would always be between the Platform and the
Earth on this side of its orbit. But on the other side of Earth
it would be above the Platform. The Platform, in fact, became
the center of a swarm, a cluster, a cloud of infinitesimal objects
which would always accompany it and always be in motion
with regard to it. Together, they should make up a
screen no proximity fuse bomb could pierce without exploding.</p>

<p>Joe heard clankings, transmitted to his body through his
feet.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he demanded sharply. "It sounds like the
airlock!"</p>

<p>Voices mingled in his ears. The other walkie-talkies allowed
everybody to speak at once. Most of them did. Then Joe heard
someone laugh. It was Sanford's voice.</p>

<p>Sandford's aluminized, space-suited figure came clanking
around the curve of the small metal world. The antenna of
his walkie-talkie glittered above his head. He seemed to
swagger against the background of many-colored stars.</p>

<p>Brent spoke quickly, before anyone else could question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Sanford. His tone was mild and matter of fact, but Joe somehow
knew the tension behind it.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sanford. You came out? Was it wise? Shouldn't
there be someone inside the Platform?"</p>

<p>Sanford laughed again. "It was very wise. We're going to
be killed, as you fellows know perfectly well. It's futile to try
to avoid it. So very sensibly I've decided to spare myself the
nuisance of waiting to be killed. I came out."</p>

<p>There was silence in the ear-phones of Joe's space suit
radio. He heard his own heart beating loudly and steadily in
the absolute stillness.</p>

<p>"Incidentally," said Sanford with almost hysterical amusement,
"I fixed it so that none of us can get back in. It would
be useless, anyhow. Everything's futility. So I've put an end to
our troubles for good. I've locked us all out."</p>

<p>He laughed yet again. And Joe knew that in Sanford's
madness it was perfectly possible for him to have done exactly
what he said.</p>

<p>There were eight human beings on the Platform. All were
now outside it, on its outer skin. They wore space suits with
from half an hour to an hour's oxygen supply. They had no
tools with which to break back into the satellite. And no help
could possibly reach them in less than three weeks.</p>

<p>If they couldn't get back inside the Platform, Sanford,
laughing proudly, had killed them all.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="c4" id="c4"></a><i>4</i></h2>


<p>There was a babbling of angry, strained, tense
voices in Joe's headphones. Then the Chief roared for silence.
It fell, save for Sanford's quiet, hysterical chuckling. Joe
found himself rather absurdly thinking that Sanford was not
actually insane, except as any man may be who believes only
in his own cleverness. Sooner or later it is bound to fail him.
On Earth, Sanford's pride in his own intellect had been useful.
He had been brilliant because he accepted every problem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and every difficulty as a challenge. But with the Platform's
situation seemingly hopeless, he'd been starkly unable to face
the fact that he wasn't clever or brilliant or intelligent enough.
If Joe's solution to the proximity fuse bombs had been offered
before his emotional collapse, he could have accepted it
grandly, and in so doing have made it his own. But it was too
late for that now. He'd given up and worked up a frantic
scorn for the universe he could not cope with. For Joe's
trick to work would have made him inferior even to Joe in
his own view. And he couldn't have that! Even to die, with
the prospect that others would survive him, was an intolerable
prospect. He had to be smarter than anybody else.</p>

<p>So he chuckled. The Chief roared wrathfully into his transmitter:
"Quiet! This crazy fool's tried to commit suicide for
all of us! How about it? Why can't we get back in? How
many locks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Joe found himself thinking hard. He could be angry later.
Now there wasn't time. Thirty or forty minutes of breathing.
No tools. A steel hull. The airlocks were naturally arranged
for the greatest possible safety under normal conditions. In
every airlock it had naturally been arranged so that the door
to space and the door to the interior could not be open at the
same time. That was to save lives. To save air, it would naturally
be arranged that the door to space couldn't be opened
until the lock was pumped empty.</p>

<p>That in itself could be an answer. Joe said sharply, "Hold it,
Chief! Somebody watch Sanford! All we've got to do is find
which lock he came out of. He couldn't get out until he
pumped it empty&mdash;and that unlocks the outer door!"</p>

<p>But Sanford laughed once more. He sounded like someone
in the highest of high good humor.</p>

<p>"Heroic again, eh? But I took a compressed air bottle in the
lock with me. When the outer door was open, I opened the
stopcock and shut the door. The air bottle filled the lock behind
me. Naturally I'd fasten the door after I came out! One
must be intelligent!"</p>

<p>Joe heard Brent muttering, "Yes, he'd do that!"</p>

<p>"Somebody check it!" snapped Joe. "Make sure! It might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
amuse him to watch us die while he knew we could get back
in if we were as smart as he is."</p>

<p>There were clankings on the hull. Men moved, unfastening
the lines which held them to the hull to get freedom of movement,
but not breaking the links which bound them to each
other. Joe saw Haney go grimly back to the task of throwing
away the stuff that they had brought out for the purpose.
Then Mike's voice, brittle and cagey: "Haney! Quit it!"</p>

<p>Sanford's voice again, horribly amused. "By all means!
Don't throw away our garbage! We may need it!"</p>

<p>A voice snapped, "This lock's fastened." Another voice:
"And this...." Other voices, with increasing desperation,
verified that every airlock was implacably sealed fast by the
presence of air pressure inside the lock itself.</p>

<p>Time was passing. Joe had never noticed, before, the minute
noises of the air pressure apparatus strapped to his back. His
exhaled breath went to a tiny pump that forced it through a
hygroscopic filter which at once extracted excess moisture and
removed carbon dioxide. The same pump carefully measured
a volume of oxygen equal to the removed CO<sub>2</sub> and added it
to the air it released. The pump made very small sounds indeed,
and the valves were almost noiseless, but Joe could hear
their clickings.</p>

<p>Something burned him. He had been standing perfectly
still while trying to concentrate on a way out. Sunshine had
shone uninterruptedly on one side of his space suit for as long
as five minutes. Despite the insulation inside, that was too
long. He turned quickly to expose another part of himself
to the sunlight. He knew abstractedly that the metal underfoot
would sear bare flesh that touched it. A few yards away, in
the shadow, the metal of the hull would be cold enough to
freeze hydrogen. But here it was fiercely hot. It would melt
solder. It might&mdash;</p>

<p>Mike was fumbling tin cans out of the net bag from which
Haney had been throwing them away. He was a singular
small figure, standing on shining steel, looking at one tin can
after another and impatiently putting them aside.</p>

<p>He found one that seemed to suit him. It was a large can.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
He knelt with it, pressing a part of it to the hot metal of the
satellite's hull. A moment later he was ripping it apart. The
solder had softened. He unrolled a sort of cylinder, then bent
again, using the curved inner surface to concentrate the intolerable
sunshine.</p>

<p>Joe caught his breath at the implication. Concentrated
sunshine can be incredibly hot. Starting with unshielded,
empty-space sunshine, practically any imaginable temperature
is possible with a large enough mirror. Mike didn't have
a concave mirror. He had only a cylindrical one. He couldn't
reflect light to a point, but only to a line. Mike couldn't hope
to do more than double or triple the temperature of a given
spot. But considering what he wore on his back&mdash;!</p>

<p>Joe made his way clumsily to the spot where Mike now
gesticulated to Haney, trying to convey his meaning by
gestures since Sanford would overhear any spoken word.</p>

<p>"I get it, Mike," said Joe. "I'll help." He added: "Chief!
You watch Sanford. The rest of you try to flatten out some tin
cans or find some with flat round ends!"</p>

<p>He reached the spot where Mike bent over the plating.
His hand moved to cast a shadow where the light had played.</p>

<p>"I need more reflectors," Mike said brusquely, "but we can
do it!"</p>

<p>Joe beckoned. There were more, hurried clankings. Space-suited
figures gathered about.</p>

<p>The Platform rolled on through space. Where it was bright
it was very, very bright, and where it was dark it was blackness.
Off in emptiness the many-colored mass of Earth shone
hugely, rolling past. Innumerable incurious stars looked on.
The sun flamed malevolently. The moon floated abstractedly
far away.</p>

<p>Mike was bent above a small round airlock door. He had
a distorted half-cylinder of sheet tin between his space-gloved
hands. It reflected a line of intensified sunlight to the edge
of the airlock seal. Haney ripped fiercely at other tin cans.
Joe held another strip of polished metal. It focused crudely&mdash;very
crudely&mdash;on top of Mike's line of reflected sunshine.
Someone else held the end of a tin can to reflect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
more sunshine. Someone else had a larger disk of tin.</p>

<p>They stood carefully still. It looked completely foolish.
There were six men in frozen attitudes, trying to reflect sunshine
down to a single blindingly-bright spot on an airlock
door. They seemed breathlessly tense. They ignored the
glories of the firmament. They were utterly absorbed in trying
to make a spot of unbearable brightness glow more brightly
still.</p>

<p>Mike moved his hand to cast a shadow. The steel was a
little more than red-hot for the space of an inch. It would not
melt, of course. It could not. And they had no tools to bend
or pierce the presumably softened metal. But Mike said
fiercely:</p>

<p>"Keep it hot!"</p>

<p>He squirmed. His space suit was fabric, like the rest, but it
had been cut down to permit him to use it. It was bulkier on
him than the suits of the others. He shifted his shoulder pack.
The brass valve-nipple by which the oxygen tank was
filled....</p>

<p>He jammed a ragged fragment of tin in place. He pressed
down fiercely. A blazing jet of fierce, scintillating, streaking
sparks leaped up from the spot where the metal glowed
brightly. A hollow in the metal plate appeared. The metal
disintegrated in gushing flecks of light....</p>

<p>White-hot iron in pure oxygen happens to be inflammable.
Iron is not incombustible at all. Powdered steel, ground fine
enough, will burn if simply exposed to air. Really fine steel
wool will make an excellent blaze if a match is touched to it.
White-hot iron, with a jet of oxygen played upon it, explodes
to steaming sparks. Technically, Mike had used the perfectly
well-known trick of an oxygen lance to pierce the airlock door,
let the air out of the lock, and so allow the outer door to be
opened.</p>

<p>There was a rush of vapor. The door was drilled through.
Haney picked Mike up bodily, Joe heaved the door open, and
Haney climbed into it, practically carrying Mike by the
scruff of the neck. Joe panted, "Plug the hole from the inside.
Sit on it if you have to!" and slammed the door shut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>They waited. Sanford's voice came in the ear-phones. It
was higher in pitch than it had been.</p>

<p>"You fools!" he raged. "It's useless! It's stupid to do useless
things! It's stupid to do anything at all&mdash;"</p>

<p>There were sudden scuffling clankings. Joe swung about.
The Chief and Sanford were struggling. Sanford flailed his
arms about, trying to break the Chief's faceplate while he
screamed furious things about futility.</p>

<p>The Chief got exactly the hold he wanted. He lifted Sanford
from the metal deck. He could have thrown him away to
emptiness, then, but he did not.</p>

<p>He set Sanford in mid-space as if upon a shelf. The raging
man hung in the void an exact man-height above the Platform's
surface. The Chief drew back and left him there, Sanford
could writhe there for a century before the Platform's infinitesimal
gravity brought him down.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the Chief wrathfully. "How's Haney and Mike
making out?"</p>

<p>Almost on the instant, twenty yards away, a tiny airlock
door thrust out from the surface of glittering metal, and
helmet and antenna appeared.</p>

<p>"You guys can come in now," said Haney's voice in Joe's
headphones. "It's all okay. Mike's pumping out the other
locks too, so you can come in at any of 'em."</p>

<p>The space-suited figures clumped loudly to airlock doors.
There were a dozen or more small airlocks in various parts of
the hull, besides the great door to admit supply ships. The
Chief growled and moved toward Sanford now raging like
the madman his helplessness made him.</p>

<p>"No," said Joe shortly. "He'd fight again. Go inside. That's
an order, Chief."</p>

<p>The Chief grunted and obeyed. Joe went to the nearest
airlock and entered the great steel hull.</p>

<p>Sanford floated in emptiness, two yards from the Space
Platform he would have turned into a derelict. He did not
move farther away. He did not fall toward it. There was nobody
to listen to him. He cried out in blood-curdling fury because
other men were smarter than he was. Other men had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
solved problems he could not solve. Other men were his
superiors. He screamed his rage.</p>

<p>Presently the Platform revolved slowly beneath him. It
was turned, of course, by the monster gyros which in turn
were controlled by the pilot gyros Joe and Haney and the
Chief and Mike had repaired when saboteurs smashed them.</p>

<p>The Platform rotated sedately. A great gap appeared in it.
The door of the supply ship lock moved until Sanford, floating
helplessly, was opposite its mouth.</p>

<p>A rod with a rounded object at its end appeared past the
docked supply ship. It reached out and touched Sanford's helmet.
It was the magnetic grapple which drew space ships into
their dock.</p>

<p>It drew Sanford, squirming and streaming, into the great
lock. The outer doors closed. Before air was admitted to the
inside, Sanford went suddenly still.</p>

<p>When they took him out of his suit he was apparently unconscious.
He could not be roused. Freed, he drew his knees
up to his chin in the position in which primitive peoples bury
their dead. He seemed to sleep. Brent examined him carefully.</p>

<p>"Catatonia," he said distastefully. "He spent his life thinking
he was smarter than anybody else&mdash;smarter, probably,
than all the universe. He believed it. He couldn't face the
fact that he was wrong. He couldn't stay conscious and not
know it. So he's blacked out. He refuses to be anything unless
he can be smartest. We'll have to do artificial feeding and all
that until we can get him down to Earth to a hospital." He
shrugged.</p>

<p>"We'd better report this down to Earth," Joe said. "By the
way, better not describe our screen of tin cans on radio waves.
Not even microwaves. It might leak. And we want to see if it
works."</p>

<p>Just forty-two hours later they found out that it did work.
A single rocket came climbing furiously out from Earth. It
came from the night-side, and they could not see where it was
launched, though they could make excellent guesses. They got
a single guided missile ready to crash it if necessary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>It wasn't necessary. The bomb from Earth detonated 300
miles below the artificial satellite. Its proximity fuse, sending
out small radar-type waves, had them reflected back by an
empty sardine can thrown away from the Platform by Mike
Scandia forty-some hours ago. The sardine can had been
traveling in its own private orbit ever since. The effect of
Mike's muscles had not been to send it back to Earth, but to
change the center of the circular orbit in which it floated.
Sometimes it floated above the Platform&mdash;that was on one side
of Earth&mdash;and sometimes below it. It was about 300 miles
under the Platform when it reflected urgent, squealing radar
frequency waves to a complex proximity fuse in the climbing
rocket. The rocket couldn't tell the difference between a sardine
can and a Space Platform.</p>

<p>It exploded with a blast of pure brightness like that of the
sun.</p>

<p>The Platform went on its monotonous round about the
planet from which it had risen only weeks before. Sanford
was strapped in a bunk and fed through a tube, and on occasion
massaged and variously tended to keep him alive. The
men on the Platform worked. They made telephoto maps of
Earth. They took highly magnified, long-exposure photographs
of Mars, pictures that could not possibly be made with such
distinctness from the bottom of Earth's turbulent ocean of air.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of official business to be done.
Weather observations of the form and distribution of cloud
masses were an important matter. The Platform could make
much more precise measurements of the solar constant than
could be obtained below. The flickering radar was gathering
information for studies of the frequency and size of meteoric
particles outside the atmosphere. There was the extremely important
project for securing and sealing in really good vacua
in various electronic devices brought up by Joe and his crew in
the supply ship.</p>

<p>But sometimes Joe managed to talk to Sally.</p>

<p>It was very satisfying to see her on the television screen
in personal conversation. Their talk couldn't be exactly private,
because it could be picked up elsewhere. It probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was. But she told Joe how she felt, and she wanted to read
him the newspaper stories based on the reports Brent had sent
down. Brent was in command of the Platform now that Sanford
lay in a resolute coma in his bunk. But Joe discouraged
such waste of time.</p>

<p>"How's the food?" asked Sally. "Are you people getting
any fresh vegetables from the hydroponic garden?"</p>

<p>They were, and Joe told her so. The huge chamber in
which sun-lamps glowed for a measured number of hours
in each twenty-four produced incredibly luxuriant vegetation.
It kept the air of the ship breathable. It even changed the
smell of it from time to time, so that there was no feeling of
staleness.</p>

<p>"And the cooking system's really good?" she wanted to
know. Sally was partly responsible for that, too. "And how
about the bunks?"</p>

<p>"I sleep now," Joe admitted.</p>

<p>That had been difficult. It was possible to get used to
weightlessness while awake. One would slip, sometimes, and
find himself suddenly tense and panicky because he'd abruptly
noticed all over again that he was falling. But&mdash;and yet again
Sally was partly responsible&mdash;the bunks were designed to help
in that difficulty. Each bunk had an inflatable top blanket.
One crawled in and settled down, and turned the petcock
that inflated the cover. Then it held one quite gently but reassuringly
in place. It was possible to stir and to turn over,
but the feeling of being held fast was very comforting. With
a little care about what one thought of before going to sleep,
one could get a refreshing eight hours' rest. The bunks were
luxury.</p>

<p>Sally said: "The date and time's a secret, of course, because
it might be overheard, but there'll be another ship up before
too long. It's bringing landing rockets for you to come back
with."</p>

<p>"That's good!" said Joe. It would feel good to set foot on
solid ground again. He looked at Sally and said eagerly,
"We've got a date the evening I get back?"</p>

<p>"We've got a date," she said, nodding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>But it couldn't very well be a definite date. There were
people with ideas that ran counter to plans for Joe to get back
to Earth and a date with Sally Holt. The Space Platform was
not admired uniformly by all the nations of Earth. The United
States had built it because the United Nations couldn't, and
one of the attractions of the idea had been that once it got out
to space and was armed, peace must reign upon Earth because
it could smack down anybody who made war.</p>

<p>The trouble was that it wasn't armed well enough. Six
guided missiles couldn't defend it indefinitely. It looked as
helpless as isolated Berlin did before the first airlift proved
what men and planes could do in the way of transport. And
the Platform's enemies didn't intend for it to be saved by
a rocketlift. They would try to smash it before such a lift
could get started.</p>

<p>A week after Joe got to it with the guided missiles, three
rockets attacked. They went up from somewhere in the middle
of the Pacific. One blew up 250 miles below the Platform.
Another detonated 190 miles away. For safety's sake the
third was crashed&mdash;at the cost of one guided missile&mdash;when it
had come within 50 miles.</p>

<p>The screen of tin cans worked, but it wasn't thick enough.
The occupants of the Platform went about hunting for sheet
metal that could be spared. They pulled out minor partitions
here and there, and went out on the surface and threw away
thousands of small glittering scraps of metal in all directions.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, there was another attack. It could be
calculated that Joe couldn't have carried up more than six
guided missiles. There might be as few as two of them left.
So eight rockets came up together&mdash;and the first of them
went off 400 miles from the Platform. Only one got as close as
200 miles. No guided missiles were expended in defense.</p>

<p>The Platform's enemies tried once more. This time the
rockets arched up above the Platform's orbit and dived on
the satellite from above. There were two of them. They went
off at 180 and 270 miles from the Platform. Joe's trash screen
would not work on Earth, but in space it was an adequate
defense against anything equipped with proximity fuses. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
could be assumed that in a full-scale space-war nuts, bolts,
rusty nails and beer bottle caps would become essential military
equipment.</p>

<p>Three days after this last attack, a second supply ship took
off from Earth. Lieutenant Commander Brown was a passenger.
Its start was just like the one Joe's ship had made.
Pushpots lifted it, jatos hurled it on, and then the furious,
flaming take-off rockets drove it valiantly out toward the
stars.</p>

<p>Joe's ship had been moved out of the landing lock and was
moored against the Platform's hull. The second ship made
contact in two hours and seventeen minutes from take-off.
It arrived with its own landing rockets intact, and it brought
a set of forty-foot metal tubes for Joe's ship to get back to
Earth with. But those landing rockets and Lieutenant Commander
Brown constituted all its payload. It couldn't bring up
anything else.</p>

<p>And Lieutenant Commander Brown called a very formal
meeting in the huge living space at the Platform's center. He
stood up grandly in full uniform&mdash;and had to hook his feet
around a chair leg to keep from floating absurdly in mid-air.
This detracted slightly from the dignity of his stance, but not
from the official voice with which he read two documents
aloud.</p>

<p>The first paper detached Lieutenant Commander Brown
from his regular naval duties and assigned him pro tem to
service with the Space Exploration Project. The second was
an order directing him to take command and assume direction
of the Space Platform.</p>

<p>Having read his orders, he cleared his throat and said
cordially, "I am honored to serve here with you. Frankly, I
expect to learn much from you and to have very few orders
to give. I expect merely to exercise such authority as experience
at sea has taught me is necessary for a tight and
happy ship. I trust this will be one."</p>

<p>He beamed. Nobody was impressed. It was perfectly obvious
that he'd simply been sent up to acquire experience in
space for later naval use, and that he'd been placed in command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
because it was unthinkable that he serve under anyone
without official rank and authority. And he quite honestly believed
that his coming, with experience in command, was a
blessing to the Platform. In fact, there was no danger that this
commander of the Platform would crack up under stress as
Sanford had.</p>

<p>But it was too bad that he hadn't brought some long-range
guided missiles with him.</p>

<p>Joe's ship had brought up twenty tons of cargo and twenty
tons of landing rockets. The second ship brought up twenty
tons of landing rockets for Joe, and twenty tons of landing
rockets for itself. That was all. The second trip out to the
Space Platform was a rescue mission and nothing else. Arithmetic
wouldn't let it be anything else. And there couldn't be
any idea of noble self-sacrifice and staying out at the Platform,
either, because only four ships like Joe's had been begun, and
only two were even near completion. Joe's had taken off the
instant it was finished. The second had done the same. The
second pair of spaceships wouldn't be ready for two months
or more. The ships that could be used had to be used.</p>

<p>So, only thirty-six hours after the arrival of the second
rocketship at the Platform, the two of them took off together
to return to Earth. Joe's ship left the airlock first. Sanford
was loaded in the cabin of the other ship as cargo. Lieutenant
Commander Brown stayed out at the Platform to replace him.</p>

<p>Obviously, in order to get back to Earth they headed away
from it in fleet formation. They pointed their rounded noses
toward the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The upward course was an application of the principle
that made the screen of tin cans and oddments remain about
the Platform. Each of those small objects had had the Platform's
own velocity and orbit. Thrown away from it, the centers
of their orbits changed. In theory, the center of the Platform's
orbit was the center of Earth. But the centers of the
orbits of the thrown-away objects were pushed a few miles&mdash;twenty&mdash;fifty&mdash;a
hundred&mdash;away from the center of Earth.</p>

<p>The returning space ships also had the orbit and speed
of the Platform. They wanted to shift the centers of their orbits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
by very nearly 4,000 miles, so that at one point they would
just barely graze Earth's atmosphere, lose some speed to it,
and then bounce out to empty space again before they melted.
Cooled off, they'd make another grazing bounce. After eight
such bounces they'd stay in the air, and the stubby fins would
give them a sort of gliding angle and controllability, while the
landing rockets would let them down to solid ground. Or so
it was hoped.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they headed out instead of in toward Earth.
They went out on their steering-rockets only, using the liquid
fuel that had not been needed for course correction on the
way out. At 4,000 miles up, the force of gravity is just one-fourth
of that at the Earth's surface. It still exists; it is merely
canceled out in an orbit. The ships could move outward at
less cost in fuel than they could move in.</p>

<p>So they went out and out on parallel courses, and the Platform
dwindled behind them. Night flowed below until the hull
of the artificial satellite shone brightly against a background of
seeming sheer nothingness.</p>

<p>The twilight zone of Earth's shadow reached the Platform.
It glowed redly, glowed crimson, glowed the deepest possible
color that could be seen, and winked out. The ships climbed
on, using their tiny steering rockets.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. The ships drew away from each other
for safety. They were 50, then 60 miles apart. One glowed red
and vanished in the shadow of the Earth. The other was extinguished
in the same way. Then they went hurtling through
the blackness of the night side of Earth. Microwaves from the
ground played upon them&mdash;radar used by friend and foe
alike&mdash;and the friendly radar guided tight-beam communicator
waves to them with comforting assurance that their joint
course and height and speed were exactly the calculated optimum.
But they could not be seen at all.</p>

<p>When they appeared again they were still farther out from
Earth than the Platform's orbit, but no farther from each other.
And they were descending. The centers of their orbits had
been displaced very, very far indeed.</p>

<p>Going out, naturally, the ships had lost angular speed as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
they gained in height. Descending, they gained in angular
velocity as they lost height. They were not quite 30 miles apart
as they sped with increasing, headlong speed and rushed toward
the edge of the world's disk. When they were only
2,000 miles high, the Earth's surface under them moved much
faster than it had on the way up. When they were only
1,000 miles high, the seas and continents seemed to flow past
like a rushing river. At 500 miles, mountains and plains were
just distinguishable as they raced past underneath. At 200
miles there was merely a churning, hurtling surface on which
one could not focus one's eyes because of the speed of its
movement.</p>

<p>They missed the solid surface of Earth by barely 40 miles.
They were moving at a completely impossible speed. The
energy of their position 4,000 miles high had been transformed
into kinetic energy of motion. And at 40 miles there
is something very close to a vacuum, compared to sea-level.
But compared to true emptiness, and at the speed of meteors,
the thin air had a violent effect.</p>

<p>A thin humming sound began. It grew louder. The substance
of the ship was responding to the impact of the thin
air upon it. The sound rose to a roar, to a bellow, to a thunderous
tumult. The ship quivered and trembled. It shook. A
violent vibration set up and grew more and more savage. The
whole ship shook with a dreadful persistence, each vibration
more monstrous, more straining, more ominous than before.</p>

<p>The four in the space ship cabin knew torture. Weight returned
to them, weight more violent than the six gravities
they had known for a bare fourteen seconds at take-off. But
that, at least, had been smoothly applied. This was deceleration
at a higher figure yet, and accompanied by the shaking
of bodies which weighed seven times as much as ever before&mdash;and
bodies, too, which for weeks past had been subject to no
weight at all.</p>

<p>They endured. Nothing at all could be done. At so many
miles per second no possible human action could be determined
upon and attempted in time to have any effect upon
the course of the ship. Joe could see out a quartzite port. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
ground 40 miles below was merely a blur. There was a black
sky overhead, which did not seem to stir. But cloud-masses
rushed at express-train speed below him, and his body
weighed more than half a ton, and the ship made the sound
of innumerable thunders and shook, and shook and
shook....</p>

<p>And then, when it seemed that it must fly utterly to pieces,
the thunder diminished gradually to a bellow, and the bellow
to a roar, and the roaring.... And the unthinkable weight
oppressing him grew less.</p>

<p>The Earth was farther away and moving farther still. They
were 100 miles high. They were 200 miles high....</p>

<p>There was no longer any sound at all, except their gaspings
for breath. Their muscles had refused to lift their chests at
all during the most brutal of the deceleration period.</p>

<p>Presently Joe croaked a question. He looked at the hull-temperature
indicators. They were very, very high. He found
that he was bruised where he had strapped himself in. The
places where each strap had held his heavy body against the
ship's vibrations were deeply black-and-blue.</p>

<p>The Chief said thickly: "Joe, somehow I don't think this
is going to work. When do we hit again?"</p>

<p>"Three hours plus or minus something," said Joe, dry-throated.
"We'll hear from the ground."</p>

<p>Mike said in a cracked voice: "Radar reports we went a
little bit too low. They think we weren't tilted up far enough.
We didn't bounce as soon as we should."</p>

<p>Joe unstrapped himself.</p>

<p>"How about the other ship?"</p>

<p>"It did better than we did," said Mike. "It's a good 200
miles ahead. Down at the Shed, they're recalculating for us.
We'll have to land with six grazes instead of eight. We lost
too much speed."</p>

<p>Joe went staggering, again weightless, to look out a port
for the other ship. He should have known better. One does
not spot an eighty-foot space ship with the naked eye when
it is 200 miles away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>But he saw something, though for seconds he didn't know
what it was.</p>

<p>Now the little ship was 300 miles high and still rising. Joe
was dazed and battered by the vibration of the ship in the
graze just past. The sister space ship hadn't lost speed so
fast. It would be traveling faster. It would be leaving him
farther behind every second. It was rising more sharply. It
would rise higher.</p>

<p>Joe stared numbly out of a port, thinking confusedly that
his hull would be dull red on its outer surface, though the
heating had been so fast that the inner surfaces of the plating
might still be cold. He saw the vast area which was the curve
of the edge of the world. He saw the sunlight upon clouds
below and glimpses of the surface of the Earth itself.</p>

<p>And he saw something rising out of the mists at the far
horizon. It was a thread of white vapor. The other rocketship
was a speck, a mote, invisible because of its size and distance.
This thread of vapor was already 100 miles long, and it expanded
to a column of whiteness half a mile across before it
seemed to dissipate. It rose and rose, as if following something
which sped upward. It was a rocket trail. The violence of its
writhings proved the fury with which the rocket climbed.</p>

<p>It was on its way to meet the other space ship.</p>

<p>It did. Joe saw the thread of vapor extend and grow until
it was higher than he was. He never saw the other ship, which
was too small. But he saw the burst of flame, bright as the
sun itself, which was the explosion of a proximity fuse bomb.
He knew, then, that nothing but incandescent, radioactive
gas remained of the other ship and its crew.</p>

<p>Then he saw the trail of the second rocket. It was rising to
meet him.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="c5" id="c5"></a><i>5</i></h2>


<p>The four of them watched through the ports
as the thread of vapor sped upward. They hated the rocket
and the people who had built it. Joe said between his teeth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
"We could spend our landing-rockets and make it chase us,
but it'll have fuel for that!"</p>

<p>The Chief muttered in Mohawk. The words sounded as if
they ought to have blue fire at their edges and smell of
sulphur. Mike the midget said crackling things in his small
voice. Haney stared, his eyes burning.</p>

<p>Their ship was a little over 400 miles up, now. The rocket
was 100 or better. The rendezvous would be probably 200
miles ahead and correspondingly higher. The rocket was accelerating
furiously. It had farther to travel, but its rate
of climb was already enormous and it increased every
second.</p>

<p>The ship could swing to right or left on steering rockets,
but the war rocket could swerve also. It was controlled from
the ground. It did not need to crash the small ship from
space. Within a limited number of miles the blast of its
atomic warhead would vaporize any substance that could
exist. And of course the ship could not turn back. Even the
expenditure of all its landing-rockets could not bring twenty
tons of ship to a halt. They could speed it up, so it would
pass the calculated meeting place ahead of the war rocket.
But the bomb would simply follow in a stern chase. In any
case, the ship could not stop.</p>

<p>But neither could the rocket.</p>

<p>Joe never knew how he saw the significance of that fact.
On land or sea, of course, an automobile or a ship moves in
the direction in which it is pointed. Even an airplane needs
to make only minor corrections for air currents which affect
it. But an object in space moves on a course which is the
sum of all its previous speeds and courses. Joe's ship was
moving eastward above the Earth at so many miles per
second. If he drove north&mdash;at a right angle to his present
course&mdash;the ship would not cease to move to the east. It would
simply move northward in addition to moving east. If the
rocket from Earth turned north or east it would continue to
move up and merely add the other motion to its vertical rise.</p>

<p>Joe stared at the uncoiling thread of vapor which was the
murder rocket's trail. He hated it so fiercely that he wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
to escape it even at the cost of destruction, merely to foil its
makers. At one moment, he was hardly aware of anything
but his own fury and the frantic desire to frustrate the rocket
at any cost. The next instant, somehow, he was not angry at
all. Because somehow his brain had dredged up the fact
that the war rocket could no more turn back than he could&mdash;and
he saw its meaning.</p>

<p>"Mike!" he snapped sharply. "Get set! Report what we do!
Everybody set for acceleration! Steering rockets ready, Chief!
Get set to help, Haney! I don't know whether we'll get out of
this alive, but we'd better get into our space suits."</p>

<p>Then he literally dived back to his acceleration chair and
strapped in in feverish haste. The ship was then a quarter
of the way to the meeting place and the rocket had very much
farther to go. But it was rising faster.</p>

<p>The ship's gyros whined and squealed as Joe jammed on
their controls. The little ship spun in emptiness. Its bow
turned and pointed down. The steering rockets made their
roarings.</p>

<p>Joe found himself panting. "The&mdash;rocket's rising faster&mdash;than
we are. It's been gaining&mdash;altitude maybe&mdash;two minutes.
It's lighter than when&mdash;it started but&mdash;it can't stop&mdash;less than
a minute, anyhow so we duck under it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not make computations. There was no time. The
war rocket might have started at four or five gravities acceleration,
but it would speed up as its fuel burned. It might be
accelerating at fifteen gravities now, and have an attained
velocity of four miles a second and still increasing. If the
little ship ducked under it, it could not kill that rate-of-climb
in time to follow in a stern chase.</p>

<p>"Haney!" panted Joe. "Watch out the port! Are we going
to make it?"</p>

<p>Haney crawled forward. Joe had forgotten the radar because
he'd seen the rocket with his own eyes. It seemed to
need eyes to watch it. Mike spoke curtly into the microphone
broadcasting to ground. He was reporting each action and
order as it took place and was given. There was no time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
explain anything. But Mike thought of the radar. He watched
it.</p>

<p>It showed the vast curve of Earth's surface, 400 miles down.
It showed a moving pip, much too much nearer, which was
the war rocket. Mike made a dot on the screen with a grease
pencil where the pip showed. It moved. He made another
dot. The pip continued to move. He made other dots.</p>

<p>They formed a curving line&mdash;curved because the rocket
was accelerating&mdash;which moved inexorably toward the center
of the radar screen. The curve would cut the screen's exact
center. That meant collision.</p>

<p>"Too close, Joe!" said Mike shrilly. "We may miss it, but
not enough!"</p>

<p>"Then hold fast," yelled Joe. "Landing rockets firing, three&mdash;two&mdash;one!"</p>

<p>The bellowing of the landing-rockets smote their ears.
Weight seized upon them, three gravities of acceleration
toward the rushing flood of clouds and solidity which was the
Earth. The ship plunged downward with all its power. It was
intolerable&mdash;and ten times worse because they had been
weightless so long and were still shaken and sore and bruised
from the air-graze only minutes back.</p>

<p>Mike took acceleration better than the others, but his voice
was thin when he gasped, "Looks&mdash;like this does it, Joe!"
Seconds later he gasped again, "Right! The rocket's above us
and still going away!"</p>

<p>The gyros squealed again. The ship plunged into vapor
which was the trail of the enemy rocket. For an instant the
flowing confusion which was Earth was blotted out. Then it
was visible again. The ship was plunging downward, but its
sidewise speed was undiminished and much greater than
its rate of fall.</p>

<p>"Mike," panted Joe. "Get the news out. What we did&mdash;and
why. I'm&mdash;going to turn the ship's head back on our&mdash;course.
We can't slow enough but&mdash;I'd rather crash on Earth
than let them blast us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ship turned again. It pointed back in the direction
from which it had come. With the brutal sternward pressure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
produced by the landing-rockets, it felt as if it were speeding
madly back where it had come from. It was the sensation
they'd felt when the ship took off from Earth, so long before.
But then the cloud masses and the earth beneath had flowed
toward the ship and under it. Now they flowed away. The
appearance was that of an unthinkably swift wake left behind
by a ship at sea. The Earth's surface fled away and fled
away from them.</p>

<p>"Crazy, this!" Joe muttered thickly. "If the ship were
lighter&mdash;or we had more power&mdash;we could land! I'm sorry,
but I'd rather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Haney turned his head from where he clung near the bow-ports.
His features changed slowly as he talked because of
acceleration-driven blood engorging his lips and bloating his
cheeks. After one instant he closed his eyes fiercely. They
felt as if they would pop out of his head. He gasped, "Yes!
Get down to air-resistance. A chance&mdash;not good but a chance&mdash;ejection
seats&mdash;with space suits&mdash;might make it...."</p>

<p>He began to let himself back toward his acceleration chair.
He could not possibly have climbed forward. It was a horrible
task to let himself down, with triple his normal weight
pulling at him and after the beating taken a little while ago.</p>

<p>Sweat stood out on his skin as he lowered himself sternward.
Once his grip on a hand-line slipped and he had to
sustain the drag of nearly six hundred pounds by a single hand
and arm. It would not be a good idea to fall at three gravities.</p>

<p>The landing rockets roared and roared, and Joe tilted the
bow down a little farther, so that the streaming flood of
clouds drew nearer.</p>

<p>Haney got to his acceleration chair. He let himself into it
and his eyes closed.</p>

<p>Mike's sharp voice barked: "What's the chance, Haney?"</p>

<p>Haney's mouth opened, and closed, and opened again.
"Rocket flames," he gasped, "pushed back&mdash;wind&mdash;splash on
hull&mdash;may melt&mdash;lighten weight&mdash;hundred to one against&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The odds were worse than that. The ship couldn't land
because its momentum was too great for the landing rockets
to cancel out. If it had weighed five tons instead of twenty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
landing might have been possible. Haney was saying that
if the ship were to be lowered into air while rushing irresistibly
sternward despite its rockets, that the rocket flames
might be splashed out by the wind. Instead of streaking
astern in a lance-like shape, they might be pushed out like a
rocket blast when it hits the earth in a guided missile take-off.
Such a blast spreads out flat in all directions. Here the
rocket flames might be spread by wind until they played upon
the hull of the ship. If they did, they might melt it as they
melted their own steel cases in firing. And three-fourths or
more of the hull might be torn loose from the cabin bow
section. So much was unlikely, but it was possible.</p>

<p>The impossible odds were that the four could survive even
if the cabin were detached. They were decelerating at three
gravities now. If part of the ship burned or melted or was
torn away, the rocket thrust might speed the cabin up to
almost any figure. And there is a limit to the number of
gravities a man can take, even in an acceleration chair.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that was what Haney proposed. They were
due to be killed anyhow. Joe tried it.</p>

<p>He dived into atmosphere. At 60 miles altitude a thin
wailing seemed to develop without reason. At 40 miles, the
ship had lost more than two miles per second of its speed since
the landing-rockets were ignited, and there was a shuddering
in all its fabric&mdash;though because of the loss of speed it was
not as bad as the atmosphere-graze. At 30 it began to shake
and tremble. At 25 miles high there was as horrible a vibration
and as deadly a deceleration as at the air-graze. At 12
miles above the surface of the Earth the hull temperature indicators
showed the hind part of the hull at red heat. The
ship happened to be traveling backward at several times the
speed of sound, and air could not move away from before it.
It was compressed to white heat at the entering surface, and
the metal plating went to bright red heat at that point. But
the hull just aft of the rocket mouths was hotter still. There
the splashing rocket flames bathed it in intolerable incandescence.
Hull plates, braces and beams glared white&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The tip of the tail caved in. The ship's empty cargo space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
was instantly filled with air at intolerable pressure and heat.</p>

<p>The hull exploded outward where the rocket flames played.
There was a monstrous, incredible jerking of the cabin that
remained. That fraction of the ship received the full force
of the rocket thrust. They could decelerate it at a rate of
fifteen gravities or more.</p>

<p>They did.</p>

<p>Joe lost consciousness as instantly and as peacefully as if
he had been hit on the jaw.</p>

<p>An unknown but brief time later, he found himself listening
with a peculiar astonishment. The rockets had burned
out. They had lasted only seconds after the separation of the
ship into two fragments. Radars on the ground are authority
for this. Those few seconds were extremely important. The
cabin lost an additional half-mile per second of velocity,
which was enough to make the difference between the cabin
heating up too, and the cabin being not quite destroyed.</p>

<p>The cabin remnant was heavy, of course, but it was an
irregular object, some twenty feet across. It was below orbital
velocity, and wind-resistance slowed it. Even so, it traveled
47 miles to the east in falling the last 10 miles to Earth. It
hit a hillside and dug itself a 70-foot crater in the ground.</p>

<p>But there was nobody in it, then. A little over a month
before, it had seemed to Joe that ejection seats were the most
useless of all possible pieces of equipment to have in a space
ship. He'd been as much mistaken as anybody could be.
With an ejection seat, a jet pilot can be shot out of a plane
traveling over Mach one, and live to tell about it. This
crumpling cabin fell fast, but Joe stuffed Mike in an ejection
seat and shot him out. He and the Chief dragged Haney to a
seat, and then the Chief shoved Joe off&mdash;and the four of them,
one by one, were flung out into a screaming stream of air.
But the ribbon-parachutes did not burst. They nearly broke
the necks of their passengers, but they let them down almost
gently.</p>

<p>And it was quite preposterous, but all four landed intact.
Mike, being lightest and first to be ejected, came down by
himself in a fury because he'd been treated with special favor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The Chief and Joe landed almost together. After a long
time, Joe staggered out of his space suit and harness and tried
to help the Chief, and they held each other up as they stumbled
off together in search of Haney.</p>

<p>When they found him he was sleeping heavily, exhausted,
in a canebrake. He hadn't even bothered to disengage his
parachute harness or take off his suit.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="c6" id="c6"></a><i>6</i></h2>


<p>A good deal of that landing remained confused
in Joe's mind. While it was going on he was much too busy to
be absorbing impressions. When he landed, he was as completely
exhausted as anybody wants to be. It was only during
the next day that he even tried to sort out his recollections.</p>

<p>Then he woke up suddenly, with a muffled roaring going
on all about him. He blinked his eyes open and listened.
Presently he realized what the noise was, and wondered that
he hadn't realized before. It was the roaring of the motors of
a multi-engined plane. He knew, without remembering the
details at the moment, that he and the other three were on a
plane bound across the Pacific for America. He was in a
bunk&mdash;and he felt extraordinarily heavy. He tried to move,
and it was an enormous effort to move his arm. He struggled
to turn over, and found straps holding his body down.</p>

<p>He fumbled at them. They had readily releasable clasps,
and he loosened them easily. After a bit he struggled to sit upright.
He was horribly heavy or horribly weak. He couldn't
tell which. And each separate muscle in his whole body ached.
Twinges of pain accompanied every movement. He sat up,
swaying a little with the slow movements of the plane, and
gradually, things came back.</p>

<p>The landing in the ribbon-chute. They'd come down somewhere
on the west coast of India, not too far from the sea. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
remembered crashing into the edge of a thin jungle and
finding the Chief, and the two of them searching out Haney
and stumbling to open ground. After laying out a signal for
air searchers, they went off into worn-out slumber while they
waited.</p>

<p>He remembered that there'd been a patrol of American
destroyers in the Arabian Sea, as everywhere under the orbit
of the Platform. Their radar had reported the destruction of
one space ship and the frantic diving of the other, its division
into two parts, and then the tiny objects, which flew out from
the smaller cabin section, which had descended as only ejection-seat
parachutes could possibly have done. Two destroyers
steamed onward underneath those drifting specks, to pick
them up when they should come down. But the other nearby
destroyers had other business in hand.</p>

<p>The two trailing destroyers reached Goa harbor within
hours of the landing of the four from space. A helicopter found
the first three of them within hours after that. They were
twenty miles inland and thirty south from Goa. Mike wasn't
located until the next day. He'd been shot out of the ship's
cabin earlier and higher; he was lighter, and he'd floated
farther.</p>

<p>But things&mdash;satisfying things&mdash;had happened in the interval.
Sitting almost dizzily on the bunk in the swiftly roaring plane
while blood began sluggishly to flow through his body, Joe
remembered the gleeful, unofficial news passed around on the
destroyers. They waited for Mike to be brought in. But they
rejoiced vengefully.</p>

<p>The report was quite true, but it never reached the newspapers.
Nobody would ever admit it, but the rockets aimed
at the returning space ships had been spotted by Navy radar
as they went up from the Arabian Sea. And the ships of the
radar patrol couldn't do anything about the rockets, but they
could and did converge savagely upon the places from which
they had been launched. Planes sped out to spot and bomb.
Destroyers arrived.</p>

<p>Somewhere there was a navy department that could write
off two modern submarines with rocket-launching equipment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
last heard from west of India. American naval men would profess
bland ignorance of any such event, but there were acres
of dead fish floating on the ocean where depth-bombs had
hunted down and killed two shapes much too big to be fish,
which didn't float when they were killed and which would
never report back how they'd destroyed two space ships.
There'd be seagulls feasting over that area, and there'd be
vague tales about the happening in the bazaars of Hadhramaut.
But nobody would ever admit knowing anything for
certain.</p>

<p>But Joe knew. He got to his feet, wobbling a little bit in
the soaring plane. He ached everywhere. His muscles protested
the strain of holding him erect. He held fast, summoning
strength. Before his little ship broke up he'd been shaken intolerably,
and his body had weighed half a ton. Where his
safety-belt had held him, his body was one wide bruise.
There'd been that killing acceleration when the ship split in
two. The others&mdash;except Mike&mdash;were in as bad a case or
worse. Haney and the Chief were like men who'd been rolled
down Mount Everest in a barrel. All of them had slept for
fourteen hours straight before they even woke up for food.
Even now, Joe didn't remember boarding this plane or getting
into the bunk. He'd probably been carried in.</p>

<p>Joe stood up, doggedly, until enough strength came to him
to justify his sitting down again. He began to dress. It was
astonishing how many places about his body were sore to
the touch. It was startling how heavy his arms and legs felt,
and how much of an effort even sitting erect was. But he began
to remember Mike's adventure, and managed to grin feebly.
It was the only thing worth a smile in all the things that had
happened.</p>

<p>Because Mike's landing had been quite unlike the others.
Joe and the Chief landed near the edge of a jungle. Haney
landed in a canebrake. But Mike came floating down from
the sky, swaying splendidly, into the estate of a minor godling.</p>

<p>He was relatively unharmed by the shaking-up he'd had.
The strength of muscles depends on their cross-section, but
their weight depends on their volume. The strength of a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
depends on the square of his size, but his weight on the cube.
So Mike had taken the deceleration and the murderous vibration
almost in his stride. He floated longer and landed
more gently than the rest.</p>

<p>Joe grinned painfully at the memory of Mike's tale. He'd
come on board the rescue destroyer in a towering, explosive
rage. When his ribbon-parachute let him down out of the
sky, it deposited him gently on ploughed fields not far from
a small and primitive Hindu village. He'd been seen to descend
from the heavens. He was a midget&mdash;not as other men&mdash;and
he was dressed in a space suit with glittering metal
harness.</p>

<p>The pagan villagers greeted him with rapture.</p>

<p>When the searching-party found Mike, they were just in
time to prevent a massacre&mdash;by Mike. <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: The original reads 'Adorning'.">Adoring</ins> natives had
seized upon him, conveyed him in high state to a red mud
temple, seemingly tried to suffocate him with evidences of
their pride and joy at his arrival, and dark-skinned maidens
were trying hopefully to win his approval of their dancing.
But the rescue-party found him with a club in his hand and
blood in his eye, setting out furiously to change the tone of his
reception.</p>

<p>Joe still didn't know all the details, but he tried to concentrate
on what he did know as he put his uniform on again.
He didn't want to think how little it meant, now. The silver
space ship badge didn't mean a thing, any more. There
weren't any more space ships. The Platform wasn't a ship,
but a satellite. There'd never been but two ships. Both had
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Joe walked painfully forward in the huge, roaring plane.
The motors made a constant, humming thunder in his ears.
It was not easy to walk. He held on to handholds as he
moved. But he progressed past the bunk space. And there
was Mike, sitting at a table and stuffing himself with good
honest food. There was a glass port beside him, and Joe
caught a glimpse of illimitable distances filled with cloud and
sky and sea.</p>

<p>Mike nodded. He didn't offer to help Joe walk. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
wouldn't have been practical. He waited until Joe sank into
a seat opposite.</p>

<p>"Good sleep?" asked Mike.</p>

<p>"I guess so," said Joe. He added ruefully, "It hurts to nod,
and I think it would hurt worse to shake my head. What's
the matter with me, Mike? I didn't get banged up in the
landing!"</p>

<p>"You got banged up before you landed," said Mike. "Worse
than that, you spent better than six weeks out of gravity,
where in an average day you took less actual exercise than a
guy in bed with two broken legs!"</p>

<p>Joe eased himself back into his chair. He felt about 600
years old. Somebody poked a head into view and withdrew it.
Joe lifted his arm and regarded it.</p>

<p>"Weighty! I guess you're right, Mike."</p>

<p>"I know I'm right!" said Mike. "If you spent six weeks in
bed you'd expect to feel wobbly when you tried to walk. Up
on the Platform you didn't even use energy to stand up! We
didn't realize it, but we were living like invalids! We'll get our
strength back, but next time we'll take measures. Huh! Take a
trip to Mars in free fall, and by the time a guy got there his
muscles'd be so flabby he couldn't stand up in half-gravity!
Something's got to be done about that, Joe!"</p>

<p>Joe said sombrely, "Something's got to be done about space
ships before that comes up again!"</p>

<p>Somebody appeared with a tray. There was food on it.
Smoking hot food. Joe looked at it and knew that his appetite,
anyhow, was back to Earth normal.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" he mumbled appreciatively, and attacked the
food.</p>

<p>Mike drank his coffee. Then he said, "Joe, do you know
anything about powder metallurgy?"</p>

<p>Joe shrugged. It hurt. "Powder metallurgy? Yes, I've seen
it used, at my father's plant. They've made small precision
parts with it. Why?"</p>

<p>"D'you know if anybody ever made a weld with it?" asked
Mike.</p>

<p>Joe chewed. Then he said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think so. Yes. At the plant they did. They had trouble
getting the surfaces properly cleaned for welding. But they
managed it. Why?"</p>

<p>"One more question," said Mike tensely. "How much Portland
cement is used to make a cubic yard of concrete?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know," admitted Joe. "Why? What's all this
about?"</p>

<p>"Haney and the Chief. Those two big apes have been
kidding me&mdash;as long as they could stay awake&mdash;for what happened
to me when I landed. Those infernal savages&mdash;" Mike
seethed. "They got my clothes off and they had me smeared all
over with butter and forty-'leven necklaces around my neck
and flowers in my hair! They thought I was some kind of
heathen god! Hanuman, somebody told me. The Hindu
monkey-god!" He raged. "And those two big apes think it's
funny! Joe, I never knew I <i>knew</i> all the words for the cussings
I gave those heathen before our fellas found me! And Haney
and the Chief will drive me crazy if I can't slap 'em down!
Powder metallurgy does the trick, from what you told me.
That's okay, then."</p>

<p>He stood up and stalked toward the front of the plane. Joe
roused himself with an effort. He turned to look about him.
Haney lay slumped in a reclining chair, on the other side of
the plane cabin. His eyes were closed. The Chief lay limply in
another chair. He smiled faintly at Joe, but he didn't try to
talk. He was too tired. The return to normal gravity bothered
him, as it did Joe.</p>

<p>Joe looked out the window. In neat, geometric spacing on
either side of the transport there were fighter jets. There
was another flight above and farther away. Joe saw, suddenly,
a peeling-off of planes from the farther formation. They
dived down through the clouds. He never knew what they
went to look for or what they found. He went groggily back
to his bunk in a strange and embarrassing weakness.</p>

<p>He woke when the plane landed. He didn't know where it
might be. It was, he knew, an island. He could see the wide,
sun-baked white of the runways. He could see sea-birds in
clouds over at the edge. The plane trundled and lurched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
slowly to a stop. A service-truck came growling up, and
somebody led cables from it up into the engines. Somebody
watched dials, and waved a hand.</p>

<p>There was silence. There was stillness. Joe heard voices
and footsteps. Presently he heard the dull booming of surf.</p>

<p>The plane seemed to wait for a very long time. Then there
was a faint, faint distant whine of jets, and a plane came from
the east. It was first a dot and then a vague shape, and then
an infinitely graceful dark object which swooped down and
landed at the other end of the strip. It came taxiing up alongside
the transport ship and stopped.</p>

<p>An officer in uniform climbed out, waved his hand, and
walked over to the transport. He climbed up the ladder and
the pilot and co-pilot followed him. They took their places.
The door closed. One by one, the jets chugged, then roared to
life.</p>

<p>The officer talked to the pilot and co-pilot for a moment.
He came down the aisle toward Joe. Mike the midget regarded
him suspiciously.</p>

<p>The plane stirred. The newly arrived officer said pleasantly,
"The Navy Department's sent me out here, Kenmore, to be
briefed on what you know and to do a little briefing in turn."</p>

<p>The transport plane turned clumsily and began to taxi down
the runway. It jolted and bumped over the tarmac, then lifted,
and Joe saw that the island was nearly all airfield. There were
a few small buildings and distance-dwarfed hangars. Beyond
the field proper there was a ring of white surf. That was all.
The rest was ocean.</p>

<p>"I haven't much briefing to do," admitted Joe.</p>

<p>Then he looked at the briefcase the other man opened. It
had sheets and sheets of paper in it&mdash;hundreds, it seemed.
They were filled with questions. He'd be called on to find
answers for most of them, and to admit he didn't know the
answers to the rest. When he was through with this questioning,
every possible useful fact he knew would be on file for
future use. And now he wrily recognized that this was part
payment for the efficiency and speed with which the Navy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
had trailed them on their landing, and for the use of a transport
plane to take them back to the United States.</p>

<p>"I'll try to answer what I can," he said cautiously. "But
what're you to brief me about?"</p>

<p>"That you're not back on Earth yet," said the officer curtly,
pulling out the first sheaf of questions. "Officially you haven't
even started back. Ostensibly you're still on the Platform."</p>

<p>Joe blinked at him.</p>

<p>"If your return were known," continued the lieutenant,
"the public would want to make heroes of you. First space
travelers, and so on. They'd want you on television&mdash;all of
you&mdash;telling about your adventures and your return. Inevitably,
what happened to your ship would leak out. And if the public
knew you'd been waylaid and shot down there'd be demands
that the government take violent action to avenge the attack.
It'd be something like the tumult over the sinking of the
<i>Maine</i>, or the <i>Lusitania</i>&mdash;or even Pearl Harbor. It's much
better for your return to be a secret for now."</p>

<p>Joe said wrily: "I don't think any of us want to be ridden
around to have ticker-tape dumped on us. That part's all
right. I'm sure the others will agree."</p>

<p>"Good! One more difficulty. We had two space ships. Now
we have none. Our most likely enemies haven't only been
building rockets, they've got a space fleet coming along. Intelligence
just found out they're nearly ready for trial trips.
They've been yelling to high heaven that we were building a
space fleet to conquer the world. We weren't. They were.
And it looks very much as if they may have beaten us."</p>

<p>The lieutenant got out the dreary mass of papers, intended
to call for every conscious or unconscious observation Joe
might have made in space. It was the equivalent of the interviews
extracted from fliers after a bombing raid, and it was
necessary, but Joe was very tired.</p>

<p>Wearily, he said, "Start your questions. I'll try to answer
them."</p>

<p>They arrived in Bootstrap some forty-six hours after the
crashing of their ship. Joe, at least, had slept nearly thirty of
those hours. So while he was still wobbly on his feet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
would be for days to come, his disposition was vastly improved.</p>

<p>There was nobody waiting on the airfield by the town of
Bootstrap, but as they landed a black car came smoothly out
and stopped close by the transport. Joe got down and climbed
into it. Sally Holt was inside. She took both his hands and
cried, and he was horribly embarrassed when the Chief came
blundering into the car after him. But the Chief growled, "If
he didn't kiss you, Sally, I'm going to kick his pants for him."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he did," said Sally, gulping. "And I'm glad you're
back, Chief. And Haney. And Mike."</p>

<p>Mike grinned as he climbed in the back too. Haney
crowded in after him. They filled the rear of the car entirely.
It started off swiftly across the field, swerving to the roadway
that led to the highway out of Bootstrap to the Shed. It sped
out that long white concrete ribbon, and the desert was
abruptly all around them. Far ahead, the great round half-dome
of the Shed looked like a cherry-pit on the horizon.</p>

<p>"It's good to be back!" said the Chief warmly. "I feel like
I weigh a ton, but it's good to be back! Mike's the only one
who was happier out yonder. He figures he belongs there. I
got a story to tell you, Sally&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chief!" said Mike fiercely. "Shut up!"</p>

<p>"Won't," said the Chief amiably. "Sally, this guy Mike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mike went pale. "You're too big to kill," he said bitterly,
"but I'll try it!"</p>

<p>The Chief grunted at him. "Quit being modest. Sally&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mike flung himself at the Chief, literally snarling. His small
fist hit the Chief's face&mdash;and Mike was small but he was not
puny. The "crack" of the impact was loud in the car. Haney
grabbed. There was a moment's frenzied struggling. Then
Mike was helplessly wrapped in Haney's arms, incoherent with
fury and shame.</p>

<p>"Crazy fool!" grunted the Chief, feeling his jaw. "What's
the matter with you? Don't you feel good?"</p>

<p>He was angry, but he was more concerned. Mike was white
and raging.</p>

<p>"You tell that," he panted shrilly, "and so help me&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's got into you?" demanded Haney anxiously. "I'd be
bragging, I would, if I'd got a brainstorm like you did! That
guy Sanford woulda wiped us all out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chief said angrily, between unease and puzzlement:</p>

<p>"I never knew you to go off your nut like this before! What's
got into you, anyway?"</p>

<p>Mike gulped suddenly. Haney still held him firmly, but
both Haney and the Chief were looking at him with worried
eyes. And Mike said desperately: "You were going to tell
Sally&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chief snorted.</p>

<p>"Huh! You fool little runt! No! I was going to tell her
about you opening up that airlock when Sanford locked us
out! Sure I kidded you about what you're talking about! Sure!
I'm going to do it again! But that's amongst us! I don't tell that
outside!"</p>

<p>Haney made an inarticulate exclamation. He understood,
and he was relieved. But he looked disgusted. He released
Mike abruptly, rumbling to himself. He stared out the window.
And Mike stood upright, an absurd small figure. His
face worked a little.</p>

<p>"Okay," said Mike, with a little difficulty. "I was dumb.
Only, Chief, you owe me a sock on the jaw when you feel like
it. I'll take it."</p>

<p>He swallowed. Sally was watching wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Sally," said Mike bitterly, "I'm a bigger fool than I look.
I thought the Chief was going to tell you what happened
when I landed. I&mdash;I floated down in a village over there in India,
and those crazy savages'd never seen a parachute, and
they began to yell and make gestures, and first thing I knew
they had a sort of litter and were piling me in it, and throwing
flowers all over me, and there was a procession&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sally listened blankly. Mike told the tale of his shame with
the very quintessence of bitter resentment. When he got to his
installation in a red-painted mud temple, and the reverent
and forcible removal of his clothes so he could be greased with
butter, Sally's lips began to twitch. At the picture of Mike
in a red loincloth, squirming furiously while brown-skinned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
admirers zestfully sang his praises, howling his rage while
they celebrated some sort of pious festival in honor of his
arrival, Sally broke down and laughed helplessly.</p>

<p>Mike stared at her, aghast. He felt that he'd hated the
Chief when he thought the Chief was going to tell the tale
on him as a joke. He'd told it on himself as a penance, in the
place of the blow he'd given the Chief and which the Chief
wouldn't return. To Mike it was still tragedy. It was still an
outrage to his dignity. But Sally was laughing. She rocked
back and forth next to Joe, helpless with mirth.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mike!" she gasped. "It's beautiful! They must have
been saying such lovely, respectful things, while you were calling
them names and wanting to kill them! They'd have been
bragging to each other about how you were&mdash;visiting them because
they'd been such good people, and&mdash;this was the reward
of well-spent lives, and you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She leaned against Joe and shook. The car went on. The
Chief chuckled. Haney grinned. Joe watched Mike as this new
aspect of his disgrace got into his consciousness. It hadn't occurred
to Mike, before, that anybody but himself had been
ridiculous. It hadn't occurred to him, until he lost his temper,
that Haney and the Chief would ride him mercilessly among
themselves, but would not dream of letting anybody outside
the gang do so.</p>

<p>Presently Mike managed to grin a little. It was a twisty
grin, and not altogether mirthful.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he said wrily. "I see it. They were crazy too. I
should've had more sense than to get mad." Then his grin
grew a trifle twistier. "I didn't tell you that the thing that
made me maddest was when they wanted to put earrings on
me. I grabbed a club then and&mdash;uh&mdash;persuaded them I
didn't like the idea."</p>

<p>Sally chortled. The picture of the small, truculent Mike in
frenzied revolt with a club against the idea of being decked
with jewelry.... Mike turned to the two big men and
shoved at them imperiously.</p>

<p>"Move over!" he growled. "If you two big lummoxes had
dropped in on those crazy goofs instead of me, they'd've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
thought you were elephants and set you to work hauling logs!"</p>

<p>He squirmed to a seat between them. He still looked
ashamed, but it was shame of a different sort. Now he looked
as if he wished he hadn't mistrusted his friends for even a moment.
And he included Sally.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he said suddenly in a different tone, "maybe it
did do some good for me to get all worked up! I got kind
of frantic. I figured somebody'd made a fool of me, and I
was going to put something over on you."</p>

<p>"Mike!" said Sally reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Not like you think, Sally," said Mike, grinning a little. "I
made up my mind to beat these lummoxes at their own game.
I asked Joe about my <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: Hyphen removed to conform to majority usage.">brainstorm</ins> in the plane. He didn't know
what I was driving at, but he said what I hoped was so. So
I'm telling you&mdash;and," he added fiercely, "if it's any good
everybody gets credit for it, because all of us four&mdash;even two
big apes who try kidding&mdash;are responsible for it!"</p>

<p>He glared at them. Joe asked. "What is it, Mike?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Mike, "I think I've got a trick to make space
ships quicker than anybody ever dreamed of. Joe says you can
make a weld with powder metallurgy. And I think we can
use that trick to make one-piece ships&mdash;lighter and stronger
and tighter&mdash;and fast enough to make your head swim! And
you guys are in on it!"</p>

<p>The black car braked by the entrance to the Security offices
outside the Shed. It looked completely deserted. There was
only a skeleton force here since the Platform had been
launched three months before. There was almost nobody to be
seen, but Mike pressed his lips pugnaciously together as they
got out of the car and went inside.</p>

<p>The four of them, with Sally, went along the empty corridors
to the major's office. He was waiting for them. He shook
hands all around. But it was not possible for Major Holt to give
an impression of cordiality.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see all of you back," he said curtly. "It
didn't look like you'd make it. Joe, you will be able to reach
your father by long-distance telephone as soon as you finish
here. I&mdash;ah&mdash;thought it would not be indiscreet to tell him you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
had landed safely, though I did ask him to keep the fact to
himself."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Joe.</p>

<p>"You answered most of the questions you needed to answer
on the plane," added the major, grimly, "and now you may
want to ask some. You know there is no ship for you. You
know that the enemies of the Platform copied our rocket fuel.
You know they've made rockets with it. You've met them!
And Intelligence says they're building a fleet of space ships&mdash;not
for space exploration, but simply to smash the Platform and
get set for an ultimatum to the United States to backwater or
be bombarded from space."</p>

<p>Mike said crisply: "How long before they can do it?"</p>

<p>Major Holt turned uncordial eyes upon him. "It's anybody's
guess. Why?"</p>

<p>"We've been working something out," said Mike, firmly
but in part untruthfully. He stood sturdily before the major's
desk, which he barely topped. "The four of us have been
working it out. Joe says they've done powder metallurgy
welds, back at his father's plant. Joe and Haney and the
Chief and me, we've been working out an idea."</p>

<p>Major Holt waited. His hands moved nervously on his desk.
Joe looked at Mike. Haney and the Chief regarded him warily.
The Chief cocked his head on one side.</p>

<p>"It'll take a minute to get it across," said Mike. "You have
to think of concrete first. When you want to make a cubic
yard of concrete, you take a cubic yard of gravel. Then you
add some sand&mdash;just enough to fill in the cracks between the
gravel. Then you put in some cement. It goes in the cracks
between the grains of sand. A little bit of cement makes a lot
of concrete. See?"</p>

<p>Major Holt frowned. But he knew these four. "I see, but
I don't understand."</p>

<p>"You can weld metals together with powder-metallurgy
powder at less than red heat. You can take steel filings for
sand and steel turnings for gravel and powdered steel for
cement&mdash;"</p>

<p>Joe jolted erect. He looked startledly at Haney and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Chief. And Haney's mouth was dropping open. A great,
dreamy light seemed to be bursting upon him. The Chief regarded
Mike with very bright eyes. And Mike sturdily,
forcefully, coldly, made a sort of speech in his small and
brittle voice.</p>

<p>Things could be made of solid steel, he said sharply, without
rolling or milling or die-casting the metal, and without
riveting or arc-welding the parts together. The trick was powder
metallurgy. Very finely powdered metal, packed tightly
and heated to a relatively low temperature&mdash;"sintered" is the
word&mdash;becomes a solid mass. Even alloys can be made by
mixing powdered metals. The process had been used only for
small objects, but&mdash;there was the analogy to concrete. A very
little powder could weld much metal, in the form of turnings
and smaller bits. And the result would be solid steel!</p>

<p>Then Mike grew impassioned. There was a wooden mockup
of a space ship in the Shed, he said. It was an absolutely
accurate replica, in wood, of the ships that had been destroyed.
But one could take castings of it, and use them for
molds, and fill them with powder and filings and turnings,
and heat them not even red-hot and there would be steel
hulls in one piece. Solid steel hulls! Needing no riveting nor
anything else&mdash;and one could do it fast! While the first hull
was fitting out a second could be molded&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Chief roared: "You fool little runt!" he bellowed.
"Tryin' to give us credit for that! You got more sense than any
of us! You worked that out in your own head&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Haney rubbed his hands together. He said softly, "I like
that! I do like that!"</p>

<p>Major Holt turned his eyes to Joe. "What's your opinion?"</p>

<p>"I think it's the sort of thing, sir, that a professional engineer
would say was a good idea but not practical. He'd mean
it would be a lot of trouble to get working. But I'd like to ask
my father. They have done powder welding at the plant
back home, sir."</p>

<p>Major Holt nodded. "Call your father. If it looks promising,
I'll pull what wires I can."</p>

<p>Joe went out, with the others. Mike was sweating. All unconsciously,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
he twisted his hands one within the other. He had
had many humiliations because he was small, but lately he
had humiliated himself by not believing in his friends. Now
he needed desperately to do something that would reflect
credit on them as well as himself.</p>

<p>Joe made the phone call. As he closed the door of the
booth, he heard the Chief kidding Mike blandly.</p>

<p>"Hey, Einstein," said the Chief. "How about putting that
brain of yours to work on a faster-than-light drive?"</p>

<p>But then he began to struggle with the long distance operator.
It took minutes to get the plant, and then it took
time to get to the point, because his father insisted on asking
anxiously how he was and if he was hurt in any way. Personal
stuff. But Joe finally managed to explain that this call
dealt with the desperate need to do something about a space
fleet.</p>

<p>His father said grimly, "Yes. The situation doesn't look too
good right now, Joe."</p>

<p>"Try this on for size, sir," said Joe. He outlined Mike's
scheme. His father interrupted only to ask crisp questions
about the mockup of the tender, already in existence though
made of wood. Then he said, "Go on, son!"</p>

<p>Joe finished. He heard his father speaking to someone
away from the phone. Questions and answers, and then
orders. His father spoke to him direct.</p>

<p>"It looks promising, Joe," said his father. "Right here at
the plant we've got the gang that can do it if anybody can.
I'm getting a plane and coming out there, fast! Get Major Holt
to clear things for me. This is no time for red tape! If he has
trouble, I'll pull some wires myself!"</p>

<p>"Then I can tell Mike it's good stuff?"</p>

<p>"It's not good stuff," said his father. "There are about forty-seven
things wrong with it at first glance, but I know how to
take care of one or two, and we'll lick the rest. You tell your
friend Mike I want to shake him by the hand. I hope to do it
tonight!"</p>

<p>He hung up, and Joe went out of the phone booth. Mike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
looked at him with yearning eyes. Joe lied a little, because
Mike rated it.</p>

<p>"My father's on the way here to help make it work," he
told Mike. Then he added untruthfully: "He said he thought
he knew all the big men in his line, and where've you been
that he hasn't heard of you?"</p>

<p>He turned away as the Chief whooped with glee. He
hurried back to Major Holt as the Chief and Haney began
zestfully to manhandle Mike in celebration of his genius.</p>

<p>The major held up his hand as Joe entered. He was using
the desk phone. Joe waited. When he hung up, Joe reported.
The major seemed unsurprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had Washington on the wire," he said detachedly.
"I talked to a personal friend who's a three-star general. There
will be action started at the Pentagon. When you came in I
was arranging with the largest producers of powder-metallurgy
products in the country to send their best men here by
plane. They will start at once. Now I have to get in touch
with some other people."</p>

<p>Joe gaped at him. The major moved impatiently, waiting
for Joe to leave. Joe gulped. "Excuse me, sir, but&mdash;my father
didn't say it was certain. He just thinks it can be made to
work. He's not sure."</p>

<p>"I didn't even wait for that, something has to turn up to
take care of this situation!" said the Major with asperity. "It
has to! This particular scheme may not work, but if it doesn't,
something will come out of the work on it! You should look at a
twenty-five cent piece occasionally, Joe!"</p>

<p>He moved impatiently, and Joe went out. Sally was smiling
in the outer office. There were whoopings in the corridor
beyond. The Chief and Haney were celebrating Mike's
brainstorm with salutary indignity, because if they didn't
make a joke of it he might cry with joy.</p>

<p>"Things look better?"</p>

<p>"They do," said Joe. "If it only works...."</p>

<p>Then he hunted in his pocket. He found a quarter and
examined it curiously. On one side he found nothing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
major could have referred to. On the other side, though,
just by George Washington's chin&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He put the quarter away and took Sally's arm.</p>

<p>"It'll be all right," he said slowly.</p>

<p>But there were times when it seemed in doubt. Joe's father
arrived by plane at sunset of that same day, and he and
three men from the Kenmore Precision Tool Company instantly
closeted themselves with Mike in Major Holt's quarters.
The powder metallurgy men turned up an hour later,
and a three-star general from Washington. They joined the
highly technical discussion.</p>

<p>Joe waited around outside, feeling left out of things. He
sat on the porch with Sally while the moon rose over the
desert and stars shone down. Inside, matters of high importance
were being battled over with the informality and heat
with which practical men get things settled. But Joe wasn't
in on it. He said annoyedly, "You'd think my father'd have
something to say to me, in all this mess! After all, I have been&mdash;well,
I have been places! But all he said was, 'How are you,
Son? Where's this Mike you talked about?'"</p>

<p>Sally said calmly, "I know just how you feel. You've made
me feel that way." She looked up at the moon. "I thought
about you all the time you were gone, and I&mdash;prayed for you,
Joe. And now you're back and not even busy! But you
don't&mdash;&mdash; It would be nice for you to think about me for a
while!"</p>

<p>"I am thinking about you!" said Joe indignantly.</p>

<p>"Now what," said Sally interestedly, "in the world could
you be thinking about me?"</p>

<p>He wanted to scowl at her. But he grinned instead.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="c7" id="c7"></a><i>7</i></h2>


<p>Time passed. Hours, then days. Things began to
happen. Trucks appeared, loaded down with sacks of white
powder. The powder was very messily mixed with water and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
smeared lavishly over the now waterproofed wooden mockup
of a space ship. It came off again in sections of white plaster,
which were numbered and set to dry in warm chambers that
were constructed with almost magical speed. More trucks arrived,
bearing such diverse objects as loads of steel turnings,
a regenerative helium-cooling plant from a gaswell&mdash;it could
cool metal down to the point where it crumbled to impalpable
powder at a blow&mdash;and assorted fuel tanks, dynamos, and electronic
machinery.</p>

<p>Ten days after Mike's first proposal of concreted steel as a
material for space ship construction, the parts of the first
casting of the mockup were assembled. They were a mold
for the hull of a space ship. There were more plaster sections
for a second mold ready to be dried out now, but meanwhile
vehicles like concrete mixers mixed turnings and filings and
powder in vast quantities and poured the dry mass here and
there in the first completed mold. Then men began to wrap
the gigantic object with iron wire. Presently that iron wire
glowed slightly, and the whole huge mold grew hotter and
hotter and hotter. And after a time it was allowed to cool.</p>

<p>But that did not mean a ceasing of activity. The plaster
casts had been made while the concreting process was worked
out. The concreting process&mdash;including the heating&mdash;was in
action while fittings were being flown to the Shed. But other
hulls were being formed by metal-concrete formation even
before the first mold was taken down.</p>

<p>When the plaster sections came off, there was a long,
gleaming, frosty-sheened metal hull waiting for the fittings. It
was a replacement of one of the two shot-down space craft,
ready for fitting out some six weeks ahead of schedule. Next
day there was a second metal hull, still too hot to touch. The
day after that there was another.</p>

<p>Then they began to be turned out at the rate of two a
day, and all the vast expanse of the Shed resounded with the
work on them. Drills drilled and torches burned and hammers
hammered. Small diesels rumbled. Disk saws cut metal
like butter by the seemingly impractical method of spinning
at 20,000 revolutions per minute. Convoys of motor busses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
rolled out from Bootstrap at change-shift time, and there
were again Security men at every doorway, moving continually
about.</p>

<p>But it still didn't look too good. There is apparently no
way to beat arithmetic, and a definitely grim problem still remained.
Ten days after the beginning of the new construction
program, Joe and Sally looked down from a gallery high up
in the outward-curving wall of the Shed. Acres of dark flooring
lay beneath them. There was a spiral ramp that wound
round and round between the twin skins of the fifty-story-high
dome. It led finally to the Communications Room at the very
top of the Shed itself.</p>

<p>Where Joe and Sally looked down, the floor was 300 feet
below. Welding arcs glittered. Rivet guns chattered. Trucks
came in the doorways with materials, and there was already a
gleaming row of eighty-foot hulls. There were eleven of them
already uncovered, and small trucks ran up to their sides to
feed the fitting-out crews such items as air tanks and gyro
assemblies and steering rocket piping and motors, and short
wave communicators and control boards. Exit doors were
being fitted. The last two hulls to be uncovered were being
inspected with portable x-ray outfits, in search of flaws. And
there were still other ungainly white molds, which were
other hulls in process of formation&mdash;the metal still pouring into
the molds in powder form, or being tamped down, or being
sintered to solidity.</p>

<p>Joe leaned on the gallery-railing and said unhappily, "I
can't help worrying, even though the Platform hasn't been
shot at since we landed."</p>

<p>That wasn't an expression of what he was thinking. He
was thinking about matters the enemies of the Platform would
have liked to know about. Sally knew these matters too. But
top secret information isn't talked about by the people who
know it, unless they are actively at work on it. At all other
times one pretends even to himself that he doesn't know it.
That is the only possible way to avoid leaks.</p>

<p>The top secret information was simply that it was still impossible
to supply the Platform. Ships could be made faster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
than had ever been dreamed of before, but so long as any
ship that went up could be destroyed on the way down, the
supply of the Platform was impractical. But the ships were
being built regardless, against the time when a way to get
them down again was thought of. As of the moment it hadn't
been thought of yet.</p>

<p>But building the ships anyhow was unconscious genius,
because nobody but Americans could imagine anything so
foolish. The enemies of the Platform and of the United States
knew that full-scale production of ships by some fantastic
new method was in progress. The fact couldn't be hidden.
But nobody in a country where material shortages were
chronic could imagine building ships before a way to use
them was known. So the Platform's enemies were convinced
that the United States had something wholly new and very
remarkable, and threatened their spies with unspeakable fates
if they didn't find out what it was.</p>

<p>They didn't find out. The rulers of the enemy nations
knew, of course, that if a new&mdash;say&mdash;space-drive had been invented,
they would very soon have to change their tune. So
there were no more attacks on the Platform. It floated serenely
overhead, sending down astronomical observations and solar-constant
measurements and weather maps, while about it
floated a screen of garbage and discarded tin cans.</p>

<p>But Joe and Sally looked down where the ships were being
built while the problem of how to use them was debated.</p>

<p>"It's a tough nut to crack," said Joe dourly.</p>

<p>It haunted him. Ships going up had to have crews. Crews
had to come down again because they had to leave supplies
at the Platform, not consume them there. Getting a ship up to
orbit was easier than getting it down again.</p>

<p>"The Navy's been working on light guided missiles," said
Sally.</p>

<p>"No good," snapped Joe.</p>

<p>It wasn't. He'd been asked for advice. Could a space ship
crew control guided missiles and fight its way back to ground
with them? The answer was that it could. But guided missiles
used to fight one's way down would have to be carried up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
first. And they would weigh as much as all the cargo a ship
could carry. A ship that carried fighting rockets couldn't carry
cargo. Cargo at the Platform was the thing desired.</p>

<p>"All that's needed," said Sally, watching Joe's face, "is a
slight touch of genius. There's been genius before now. Burning
your cabin free with landing-rocket flames&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haney's idea," growled Joe dispiritedly.</p>

<p>"And making more ships in a hurry with metal-concrete&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mike did that," said Joe ruefully.</p>

<p>"But you made the garbage-screen for the Platform," insisted
Sally.</p>

<p>"Sanford had made a wisecrack," said Joe. "And it just
happened that it made sense that he hadn't noticed." He
grimaced. "You say something like that, now...."</p>

<p>Sally looked at him with soft eyes. It wasn't really his job,
this worrying. The top-level brains of the armed forces were
struggling with it. They were trying everything from redesigned
rocket motors to really radical notions. But there wasn't
anything promising yet.</p>

<p>"What's really needed," said Sally regretfully, "is a way
for ships to go up to the Platform and not have to come back."</p>

<p>"Sure!" said Joe ironically. Then he said, "Let's go down!"</p>

<p>They started down the long, winding ramp which led between
the two skins of the Shed's wall. It was quite empty, this
long, curving, descending corridor. It was remarkably private.
In a place like the Shed, with frantic activity going on all
around, and even at Major Holt's quarters where Sally lived
and Joe was a guest, there wasn't often a chance for them to
talk in any sort of actual privacy.</p>

<p>But Joe went on, scowling. Sally went with him. If she
seemed to hang back a little at first, he didn't notice. Presently
she shrugged her shoulders and ceased to try to make him notice
that nobody else happened to be around. They made a
complete circuit of the Shed within its wall, Joe staring ahead
without words.</p>

<p>Then he stopped abruptly. His expression was unbelieving.
Sally almost bumped into him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"You had it, Sally!" he said amazedly. "You did it! You said
it!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The touch of genius!" He almost babbled. "Ships that can
go up to the Platform and not have to come back! Sally, you
did it! You did it!"</p>

<p>She regarded him helplessly. He took her by the shoulders
as if to shake her into comprehension. But he kissed her exuberantly
instead.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he said urgently. "I've got to tell the gang!"</p>

<p>He grabbed her hand and set off at a run for the bottom of
the ramp. And Sally, with remarkably mingled emotions
showing on her face, was dragged in his wake.</p>

<p>He was still pulling her after him when he found the Chief
and Haney and Mike in the room at Security where they were
practically self-confined, lest their return to Earth become
too publicly known. Mike was stalking up and down with
his hands clasped behind his back, glum as a miniature Napoleon
and talking bitterly. The Chief was sprawled in a
chair. Haney sat upright regarding his knuckles with a
thoughtful air.</p>

<p>Joe stepped inside the door. Mike continued without a
pause: "I tell you, if they'll only use little guys like me, the
cabin and supplies and crew can be cut down by tons! Even
the instruments can be smaller and weigh less! Four of us in a
smaller cabin, less grub and air and water&mdash;we'll save tons
in cabin-weight alone! Why can't you big lummoxes see it?"</p>

<p>"We see it, Mike," Haney said mildly. "You're right. But
people won't do it. It's not fair, but they won't."</p>

<p>Joe said, beaming, "Besides, Mike, it'd bust up our gang!
And Sally's just gotten the real answer! The answer is for
ships to go up to the Platform and not come back!"</p>

<p>He grinned at them. The Chief raised his eyebrows. Haney
turned his head to stare. Joe said exuberantly: "They've been
talking about arming ships with guided missiles to fight with.
Too heavy, of course. But&mdash;if we could handle guided missiles,
why couldn't we handle drones?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The three of them gaped at him. Sally said, startled, "But&mdash;but,
Joe, I didn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've got plenty of hulls!" said Joe. Somehow he still
looked astonished at what he'd made of Sally's perfectly obvious
comment. "Mike's arranged for that! Make&mdash;say&mdash;six of
'em into drones&mdash;space barges. Remote-controlled ships. Control
them from one manned ship&mdash;the tug! We'll ride that! Take
'em up to the Platform exactly like a tug tows barges. The
tow-line will be radio beams. We'll have a space-tow up, and
not bother to bring the barges back! There won't be any landing
rockets! They'll carry double cargo! That's the answer! A
space tug hauling a tow to the Platform!"</p>

<p>"But, Joe," insisted Sally, "I didn't think of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chief heaved himself up. Haney's voice cut through
what the Chief was about to say. Haney said drily: "Sally, if
Joe hadn't kissed you for thinking that up, I would. Makes
me feel mighty dumb."</p>

<p>Mike swallowed. Then he said loyally, "Yeah. Me too. I'd've
made a two-ton cargo possible&mdash;maybe. But this adds up.
What does the major say?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;haven't talked to him. I'd better, right away." Joe
grinned. "I wanted to tell you first."</p>

<p>The Chief grunted. "Good idea. But hold everything!" He
fumbled in his pocket. "The arithmetic is easy enough, Joe.
Cut out the crew and air and you save something." He felt
in another pocket. "Leave off the landing rockets, and you
save plenty more. Count in the cargo you could take anyhow"&mdash;&mdash; he
searched another pocket still&mdash;&mdash;"and you get forty-two
tons of cargo per space barge, delivered at the Platform.
Six drones&mdash;that's 252 tons in one tow! Here!" He'd found
what he wanted. It was a handkerchief. He thrust it upon
Joe. "Wipe that lipstick off, Joe, before you go talk to the
major. He's Sally's father and he might not like it."</p>

<p>Joe wiped at his face. Sally, her eyes shining, took the
handkerchief from him and finished the job. She displayed
that remarkable insensitivity of females in situations productive
of both pride and embarrassment. When a girl or a woman is
proud, she is never embarrassed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>She and Joe went away, and Sally rushed right into her
father's office. In fifteen minutes technical men began to arrive
for conferences, summoned by telephone. Within forty-five
minutes, messengers carried orders out to the Shed floor
and stopped the installation of certain types of fittings in all
but one of the hulls. In an hour and a half, top technical designers
were doing the work of foremen and getting things
done without benefit of blueprints. The proposal was beautifully
simple to put into practice. Guided-missile control systems
were already in mass production. They could simply be
adjusted to take care of drones.</p>

<p>Within twelve hours there were truck-loads of new sorts
of supplies arriving at the Shed. Some were Air Force supplies
and some were Ordnance, and some were strictly Quartermaster.
These were not component parts of space ships. They
were freight for the Platform.</p>

<p>And, just forty-eight hours after Joe and Sally looked dispiritedly
down upon the floor of the Shed, there were seven
gleaming hulls in launching cages and the unholy din of
landing pushpots outside the Shed. They came with hysterical
cries from their airfield to the south, and they flopped flat
with extravagant crashings on the desert outside the eastern
door.</p>

<p>By the time the pushpots had been hauled in, one by one,
and had attached themselves to the launching cages, Joe and
Haney and the Chief and Mike had climbed into the cabin
of the one ship which was not a drone. There were now seven
cages in all to be hoisted toward the sky. A great double triangular
gore had been jacked out and rolled aside to make an
exit in the side of the Shed. Nearly as many pushpots, it
seemed, were involved in this launching as in the take-off of
the Platform itself.</p>

<p>The routine test before take-off set the pushpot motors to
roaring inside the Shed. The noise was the most sustained and
ghastly tumult that had been heard on Earth since the departure
of the Platform.</p>

<p>But this launching was not so impressive. It was definitely
untidy, imprecise, and unmilitary. There were seven eighty-foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
hulls in cages surrounded by clustering, bellowing, preposterous
groups of howling objects that looked like over-sized
black beetles. One of the seven hulls had eyes. The
others were blind&mdash;but they were equipped with radio antennae.
The ship with eyes had several small basket-type
radar bowls projecting from its cabin plating.</p>

<p>The seven objects rose one by one and went bellowing and
blundering out to the open air. At 40 and 50 feet above the
ground, they jockeyed into some sort of formation, with much
wallowing and pitching and clumsy maneuvering.</p>

<p>Then, without preliminary, they started up. They rose
swiftly. The noise of their going diminished from a bellow
to a howl, and from a howl to a moaning noise, and then to
a faint, faint, ever-dwindling hum.</p>

<p>Presently that faded out, too.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="c8" id="c8"></a><i>8</i></h2>


<p>All the sensations were familiar, the small
fleet of improbable objects rose and rose. Of all flying objects
ever imagined by man, the launching cages supported by
pushpots were most irrational.</p>

<p>The squadron, though, went bumbling upward. In the
manned ship, Joe was more tense than on his other take-off&mdash;if
such a thing was possible. His work was harder this trip.
Before, he'd had Mike at communications and the Chief at the
steering rockets while Haney kept the pushpots balanced for
thrust. Now Joe flew the manned ship alone. Headphones and
a mike gave him communications with the Shed direct, and the
pushpots were balanced in groups, which cost efficiency but
helped on control. He would have, moreover, to handle his
own steering rockets during acceleration and when he could&mdash;and
dared&mdash;he should supervise the others. Because each of the
other three had two drone-ships to guide. True, they had only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to keep their drones in formation, but Joe had to navigate for
all. The four of them had been assigned this flight because
of its importance. They happened to be the only crew alive
who had ever flown a space ship designed for maneuvering,
and their experience consisted of a single trip.</p>

<p>The jet stream was higher this time than on that other
journey now two months past. They blundered into it at
36,000 feet. Joe's headphones buzzed tinnily. Radar from the
ground told him his rate-of-rise, his ground speed, his orbital
speed, and added comments on the handling of the drones.</p>

<p>The last was not a precision job. On the way up Joe protested,
"Somebody's ship&mdash;Number Four&mdash;is lagging! Snap it
up!"</p>

<p>Mike said crisply, "Got it, Joe. Coming up!"</p>

<p>"The Shed says three separate ships are getting out of formation.
And we need due east pointing. Check it."</p>

<p>The Chief muttered, "Something whacky here ... come
round, you! Okay, Joe."</p>

<p>Joe had no time for reflection. He was in charge of the
clumsiest operation ever designed for an exact result. The
squadron went wallowing toward the sky. The noise was horrible.
A tinny voice in his headphones:</p>

<p>"<i>You are at 65,000 feet. Your rate-of-climb curve is flattening.
You should fire your jatos when practical. You have some
leeway in rocket power.</i>"</p>

<p>Joe spoke into the extraordinary maze of noise waves and
pressure systems in the air of the cabin.</p>

<p>"We should blast. I'm throwing in the series circuit for
jatos. Try to line up. We want the drones above us and with
a spread, remember! Go to it!"</p>

<p>He watched his direction indicator and the small graphic
indicators telling of the drones. The sky outside the ports was
dark purple. The launching cage responded sluggishly. Its
open end came around toward the east. It wobbled and wavered.
It touched the due-east point. Joe stabbed the firing-button.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. He hadn't expected it. The seven ships
had to keep in formation. They had to start off on one course&mdash;with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
a slight spread as a safety measure&mdash;and at one time. So
the firing-circuits were keyed to relays in series. Only when
all seven firing-keys were down at the same time would any of
the jatos fire. Then all would blast together.</p>

<p>The pilots in the cockpit-bubbles of the pushpots had an
extraordinary view of the scene. At something over twelve
miles height, seven aggregations of clumsy black things clung
to frameworks of steel, pushing valorously. Far below there
were clouds and there was Earth. There was a horizon, which
wavered and tilted. The pushpots struggled with seeming lack
of purpose. One of the seven seemed to drop below the others.
They pointed vaguely this way and that&mdash;all of them. But
gradually they seemed to arrive at an uncertain unanimity.</p>

<p>Joe pushed the firing-button again as his own ship touched
the due-east mark. Again nothing happened. Out of the corner
of his eye he saw Haney pressing down both buttons. The
Chief's finger lifted. Mike pushed down one button and held
off the other.</p>

<p>Roarings and howlings of pushpots. Wobblings and heart-breaking
clumsinesses of the drone-ships. They hung in the
sky while the pushpots used up their fuel.</p>

<p>"We've got to make it soon," said Joe grimly. "We've got
forty seconds. Or we'll have to go down and try again."</p>

<p>There was a clock dial with a red sweep-hand which moved
steadily and ominously toward a deadline time for firing.
Up to that deadline, the pushpots could let the ships back
down to Earth without crashing them. After it, they'd run out
of fuel before a landing could be made.</p>

<p>The deadline came closer and closer. Joe snapped:</p>

<p>"Take a degree leeway. We've got ten seconds."</p>

<p>He had the manned ship nearly steady. He held down the
firing-button, holding aim by infinitesimal movements of the
controls. Haney pushed both hands down, raised one, pushed
again. The Chief had one finger down. Mike had both firing
buttons depressed.... The Chief pushed down his second
button, quietly.</p>

<p>There was a monstrous impact. Every jato in every pushpot
about every launching cage fired at once. Joe felt himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
flung back into his acceleration chair. Six gravities. He began
the horrible fight to stay alive, while the blood tried to drain
from the conscious forepart of his brain, and while every
button of his garments pressed noticeably against him, and
objects in his pockets pushed. The sides of his mouth dragged
back, and his cheeks sagged, and his tongue strove to sink back
into his throat and strangle him.</p>

<p>It was very bad. It seemed to last for centuries.</p>

<p>Then the jatos burned out. There was that ghastly feeling
of lunging forward to weightlessness. One instant, Joe's body
weighed half a ton. The next instant, it weighed less than a
dust grain. His head throbbed twice as if his skull were about
to split open and let his brains run out. But these things he had
experienced before.</p>

<p>There were pantings in the cabin about him. The ship fell.
It happened to be going up, but the sensation and the fact was
free fall. Joe had been through this before, too. He gasped
for breath and croaked, "Drones?"</p>

<p>"Right," said Haney.</p>

<p>Mike panted anxiously, "Four's off course. I'll fix it."</p>

<p>The Chief grunted guttural Mohawk. His hands stirred on
the panel for remote control of the drones he had to handle.</p>

<p>"Crazy!" he growled. "Got it now, Joe. Fire when ready."</p>

<p>"Okay, Mike?"</p>

<p>A half-second pause.</p>

<p>"Okay!"</p>

<p>Joe pressed the firing-button for the take-off rockets. And
he was slammed back into his acceleration chair again. But
this was three gravities only. Pressed heavily against the acceleration
cushions, he could perform the navigation for the
fleet. He did. The mother-ship had to steer a true course, regardless
of the vagaries of its rockets. The drones had simply
to be kept in formation with it. The second task was simpler.
But Joe was relieved, this time, of the need to report back instrument-readings.
A telemetering device took care of that.</p>

<p>The take-off rockets blasted and blasted and blasted. The
mere matter of staying alive grew very tedious. The ordeal
seemed to last for centuries. Actually it could be measured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
only in minutes. But it seemed millennia before the headphones
said, staccato fashion: "<i>You are on course and will
reach speed in fourteen seconds. I will count for you.</i>"</p>

<p>"Relays for rocket release," panted Joe. "Throw 'em over!"</p>

<p>Three hands moved to obey. Joe could release the drive
rockets on all seven ships at will.</p>

<p>The voice counted:</p>

<p>"<i>Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five
... four ... three ... two ... one ... cut!</i>"</p>

<p>Joe pressed the master-key. The remnants of the solid-fuel
take-off rockets let go. They flashed off into nothingness at
unbelievable speed, consuming themselves as they went.</p>

<p>There was again no weight.</p>

<p>This time there was no resting. No eager gazing out the
cabin ports. Now they weren't curious. They'd had over a
month in space, and something like sixteen days back on
Earth, and now they were back in space again.</p>

<p>Mike and Haney and the Chief worked doggedly at their
control boards. The radar bowls outside the cabin shifted
and moved and quivered. The six drone ships showed on the
screens. But they also had telemetering apparatus. They faithfully
reported their condition and the direction in which their
bows pointed. The radars plotted their position with relation
to each other and the mother-ship.</p>

<p>Presently Joe cast a glance out of a port and saw that the
dark line of sunset was almost below. The take-off had been
timed to get the ships into Earth's shadow above the area from
which war rockets were most likely to rise. It wouldn't prevent
bombing, of course. But there was a gadget....</p>

<p>Joe spoke into the microphone: "Reporting everything all
right so far. But you know it."</p>

<p>The voice from solid ground said, "<i>Report acknowledged.</i>"</p>

<p>The ships went on and on and on. The Chief muttered to
himself and made very minute adjustments of the movement
of one of his drones. Mike fussed with his. Haney regarded
the controls of his drones with a profound calm.</p>

<p>Nothing happened, except that they seemed to be falling
into a bottomless pit and their stomach-muscles knotted and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
cramped in purely reflex response to the sensation. Even that
grew tedious.</p>

<p>The headphones said, "<i>You will enter Earth's shadow in
three minutes. Prepare for combat.</i>"</p>

<p>Joe said drily, "We're to prepare for combat."</p>

<p>The Chief growled. "I'd like to do just that!"</p>

<p>The phrasing, of course, was intentional&mdash;in case enemy
ears were listening. Actually, the small fleet was to use a
variant on the tin can shield which protected the Platform.
It would be most effective if visual observation was impossible.
The fleet was seven ships in very ragged formation. Most improbably,
after the long three-gravity acceleration, they were
still within a fifty-mile globe of space. Number Four loitered
behind, but was being brought up by judicious bursts of steering-rocket
fire. Number Two was some distance ahead. The
others were simply scattered. They went floating on like a
group of meteors. Out the ports, two of them were visible. The
others might be picked out by the naked eye&mdash;but it wasn't
likely.</p>

<p>Drone Two, far ahead and clearly visible, turned from a
shining steel speck to a reddish pin-point of light. The red
color deepened. It winked out. The sunlight in the ports of
the mother-ship turned red. Then it blacked out.</p>

<p>"Shoot the ghosts," said Joe.</p>

<p>The three drone-handlers pushed their buttons. Nothing
happened that anybody could see. Actually, though, a small
gadget outside the hull began to cough rhythmically. Similar
devices on the drones coughed, too. They were small, multiple-barreled
guns. Rifle shells fired two-pound missiles at random
targets in emptiness. They wouldn't damage anything they
hit. They'd go varying distances, explode and shoot small lead
shot ahead to check their missile-velocity, and then emit dense
masses of aluminum foil. There was no air resistance. The
shredded foil would continue to move through emptiness at
the same rate as the convoy-fleet. The seven ships had fired
a total of eighty-four such objects away into the blackness of
Earth's shadow. There were, then, seven ships and eighty-four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
masses of aluminum foil moving through emptiness. They
could not be seen by telescopes.</p>

<p>And radars could not tell ships from masses of aluminum
foil.</p>

<p>If enemy radars came probing upward, they reported ninety-one
space ships in ragged but coherent formation, soaring
through emptiness toward the Platform. And a fleet like that
was too strong to attack.</p>

<p>The radar operators had been prepared to forward details
of the speed and course of a single ship to waiting rocket-launching
submarines half-way across the Pacific. But they
reported to Very High Authority instead.</p>

<p>He received the report of an armada&mdash;an incredible fleet&mdash;in
space. He didn't believe it. But he didn't dare disbelieve it.</p>

<p>So the fleet swam peacefully through the darkness that was
Earth's shadow, and no attempt at attack was made. They
came out into sunlight to look down at the western shore of
America itself. With seven ships to get on an exact course, at
an exact speed, at an exact moment, time was needed. So the
fleet made almost a complete circuit of the Earth before
reaching the height of the Platform's orbit.</p>

<p>They joined it. A single man in a space suit, anchored to its
outer plates, directed a plastic hose which stretched out impossibly
far and clamped to one drone with a magnetic grapple.
He maneuvered it to the hull and made it fast. He captured
a second, which was worked delicately within reach
by coy puffs of steering-rocket vapor.</p>

<p>One by one, the drones were made fast. Then the manned
ship went in the lock and the great outer door closed, and the
plastic-fabric walls collapsed behind their nets, and air came
in.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Commander Brown was the one to come into the
lock to greet them. He shook hands all around&mdash;and it again
seemed strange to all the four from Earth to find themselves
with their feet more or less firmly planted on a solid floor, but
their bodies wavering erratically to right and left and before
and back, because there was no up or down.</p>

<p>"Just had reports from Earth," Brown told Joe comfortably.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
"The news of your take-off was released to avoid panic in
Europe. But everybody who doesn't like us is yelling blue
murder. Somebody&mdash;you may guess who&mdash;is announcing that
a fleet of ninety-one war rockets took off from the United
States and now hangs poised in space while the decadent
American war-mongers prepare an ultimatum to all the world.
Everybody's frightened."</p>

<p>"If they'll only stay scared until we get unloaded," said
Joe in some satisfaction, "the government back home can tell
them how many we were and what we came up for. But we'll
probably make out all right, anyhow."</p>

<p>"My crew will unload," said Brown, in conscious thoughtfulness.
"You must have gotten pretty well exhausted by that
acceleration."</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. "I think we can handle the freight faster.
We found out a few things by going back to Earth."</p>

<p>A section of plating at the top of the lock&mdash;at least it had
been the top when the Platform was built on Earth&mdash;opened
up as on the first journey here. A face grinned down. But from
this point on, the procedure was changed. Haney and Joe
went into the cargo-section of the rocketship and heaved its
contents smoothly through weightlessness to the storage chamber
above. The Chief and Mike stowed it there. The speed and
precision of their work was out of all reason. Brown stared
incredulously.</p>

<p>The fact was simply that on their first trip to the Platform,
Joe and his crew didn't know how to use their strength where
there was no weight. By the time they'd learned, their muscles
had lost all tone. Now they were fresh from Earth, with Earth-strength
muscles&mdash;and they knew how to use them.</p>

<p>"When we got back," Joe told Brown, "we were practically
invalids. No exercise up here. This time we've brought some
harness to wear. We've some for you, too."</p>

<p>They moved out of the airlock, and the ship was maneuvered
to a mooring outside, and a drone took its place.
Brown's eyes blinked at the unloading of the drone. But he
said, "Navy style work, that!"</p>

<p>"Out here," said Joe, "you take no more exercise than an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
invalid on Earth&mdash;in fact, not as much. By now the original
crew would have trouble standing up on a trip back to Earth.
You'd feel pretty heavy, yourself."</p>

<p>Brown frowned.</p>

<p>"Hm. I&mdash;ah&mdash;I shall ask for instructions on the matter."</p>

<p>He stood erect. He didn't waver on his feet as the others
did. But he wore the same magnetic-soled shoes. Joe knew,
with private amusement, that Brown must have worked hard
to get a dignified stance in weightlessness.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenmore," said Brown suddenly. "Have you been
assigned a definite rank as yet?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," said Joe without interest. "I skipper
the ship I just brought up. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your ship has no rating!" protested Brown irritably. "The
skipper of a Navy ship may be anything from a lieutenant
junior grade to a captain, depending on the size and rating of
the ship. In certain circumstances even a noncommissioned
officer. Are you an enlisted man?"</p>

<p>"Again, not that I know of," Joe told him. "Nor my crew,
either."</p>

<p>Brown looked at once annoyed and distressed.</p>

<p>"It isn't regular!" he objected. "It isn't shipshape! I should
know whether you are under my command or not! For
discipline! For organization! It should be cleared up! I shall
put through an urgent inquiry."</p>

<p>Joe looked at him incredulously. Lieutenant Commander
Brown was a perfectly amiable man, but he had to have things
in a certain pattern for him to recognize that they were in a
pattern at all. He was more excited over the fact that he didn't
know whether he ranked Joe, than over the much more important
matter of physical deterioration in the absence of
gravity. Yet he surely understood their relative importance.
The fact was, of course, that he could confidently expect exact
instructions about the last, while he had to settle matters of
discipline and routine for himself.</p>

<p>"I shall ask for clarification of your status," he said worriedly.
"It shouldn't have been left unclear. I'd better attend
to it at once."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at Joe as if expecting a salute. He didn't get it.
He clanked away, his magnetic shoe-soles beating out a singularly
martial rhythm. He must have practised that walk, in
private.</p>

<p>Joe got out of the airlock as another of the space barges
was warped in. Brent, the crew's psychologist, joined him
when he went to unload. Brent nodded in a friendly fashion to
Joe.</p>

<p>"Quite a change, eh?" he said drily. "Sanford turned out
to be a crackpot with his notions of grandeur. I'm not sure
that Brown's notions of discipline aren't worse."</p>

<p>Joe said, "I've something rather important to pass on," and
told about the newly discovered physical effects of a long
stay where there was no gravity. The doctors now predicted
that anybody who spent six months without weight would
suffer a deterioration of muscle tone which could make a return
to Earth impossible without a long preliminary process of
retraining. One's heart would adjust to the absence of any
need to pump blood against gravity.</p>

<p>"Which," said Joe, "means that you're going to have to be
relieved before too long. But we brought up some gravity-simulator
harness that may help."</p>

<p>Brent said desolately: "And I was so pleased! We all had
trouble with insomnia, at first, but lately we've all been sleeping
well! Now I see why! Normally one sleeps because he's
tired. We had trouble sleeping until our muscles got so weak
we tired anyhow!"</p>

<p>Another drone came in and was unloaded. And another
and another. But the last of them wasn't only unloaded.
Haney took over the Platform's control board and&mdash;grinning
to himself&mdash;sent faint, especially-tuned short wave impulses
to the steering-rockets of the drone. The liquid-fuel rockets
were designed to steer a loaded ship. With the airlock door
open, the silvery ship leaped out of the dock like a frightened
horse. The liquid-fuel rocket had a nearly empty hull to accelerate.
It responded skittishly.</p>

<p>Joe watched out a port as it went hurtling away. The vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Earth rolled beneath it. It sped on and vanished. Its fumes
ceased to be visible. Joe told Brent:</p>

<p>"Another nice job, that! We sent it backward, slowing it
a little. It'll have a new orbit, independent of ours and below
it. But come sixty hours it will be directly underneath. We'll
haul it up and refuel it. And our friends the enemy will hate
it. It's a radio repeater. It'll pick up short-wave stuff beamed
to it, and repeat it down to Earth. And they can try to jam
that!"</p>

<p>It was a mildly malicious trick to play. Behind the Iron
Curtain, broadcasts from the free world couldn't be heard because
of stations built to emit pure noise and drown them out.
But the jamming stations were on the enemy nations' borders.
If radio programs came down from overhead, jamming would
be ineffective at least in the center of the nations. Populations
would hear the truth, even though their governments objected.</p>

<p>But that was a minor matter, after all. With space ship hulls
coming into being by dozens, and with one convoy of hundreds
of tons of equipment gotten aloft, the whole picture of
supply for the Platform had changed.</p>

<p>Part of the new picture was two devices that Haney and
the Chief were assembling. They were mostly metal backbone
and a series of tanks, with rocket motors mounted on ball and
socket joints. They looked like huge red insects, but they were
officially rocket recovery vehicles, and Joe's crew referred to
them as space wagons. They had no cabin, but something like
a saddle. Before it there was a control-board complete with
radar-screens. And there were racks to which solid-fuel rockets
of divers sizes could be attached. They were literally short-range
tow craft for travel in space. They had the stripped,
barren look of farm machinery. So the name "space wagon"
fitted. There were two of them.</p>

<p>"We're putting the pair together," the Chief told Joe.
"Looks kinda peculiar."</p>

<p>"It's only for temporary use," said Joe. "There's a bigger
and better one being built with a regular cabin and hull. But
some experience with these two will be useful in running a
regular space tug."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chief said with a trace too much of casualness: "I'm
kind of looking forward to testing this."</p>

<p>"No," said Joe doggedly. "I'm responsible. I take the first
chance. But we should all be able to handle them. When this
is assembled you can stand by with the second one. If the first
one works all right, we'll try the second."</p>

<p>The Chief grimaced, but he went back to the assembly of
the spidery device.</p>

<p>Joe got out the gravity-simulator harnesses. He showed
Brent how they worked. Brown hadn't official instructions to
order their use, but Joe put one on himself, set for full Earth-gravity
simulation. He couldn't imitate actual gravity, of
course. Only the effect of gravity on one's muscles. There
were springs and elastic webbing pulling one's shoulders and
feet together, so that it was as much effort to stand extended&mdash;with
one's legs straight out&mdash;as to stand upright on Earth. Joe
felt better with a pull on his body.</p>

<p>Brent was upset when he found that to him more than a
tenth of normal gravity was unbearable. But he kept it on at
that. If he increased the pull a very little every day, he might
be able to return to Earth, in time. Now it would be a very
dangerous business indeed. He went off to put the other members
of the crew in the same sort of harness.</p>

<p>After ten hours, a second drone broadcaster went off into
space. By that time the articulated red frameworks were assembled.
They looked more than ever like farm machinery,
save that their bulging tanks made them look insectile, too.
They were actually something between small tow-boats and
crash-wagons. A man in a space suit could climb into the saddle
of one of these creations, plug in the air-line of his suit to
the crash-wagon's tanks, and travel in space by means of the
space wagon's rockets. These weird vehicles had remarkably
powerful magnetic grapples. They were equipped with steering
rockets as powerful as those of a ship. They had banks of
solid-fuel rockets of divers power and length of burning. And
they even mounted rocket missiles, small guided rockets which
could be used to destroy what could not be recovered. They
were intended to handle unmanned rocket shipments of supplies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to the Platform. There were reasons why the trick should
be economical, if it should happen to work at all.</p>

<p>When they were ready for testing, they seemed very small
in the great space lock. Joe and the Chief very carefully
checked an extremely long list of things that had to work right
or nothing would work at all. That part of the job wasn't thrilling,
but Joe no longer looked for thrills. He painstakingly did
the things that produced results. If a sense of adventure
seemed to disappear, the sensations of achievement more than
made up for it.</p>

<p>They got into space suits. They were in an odd position on
the Platform. Lieutenant Commander Brown had avoided Joe
as much as possible since his arrival. So far he'd carefully
avoided giving him direct orders, because Joe was not certainly
and officially his subordinate. Lacking exact information, the
only thing a conscientious rank-conscious naval officer could
do was exercise the maximum of tact and insistently ask
authority for a ruling on Joe's place in the hierarchy of rank.</p>

<p>Joe flung a leg over his eccentric, red-painted mount. He
clipped his safety-belt, plugged in his suit air-supply to the
space wagon's tanks, and spoke into his helmet transmitter.</p>

<p>"Okay to open the lock. Chief, you keep watch. If I make
out all right, you can join me. If I get in serious trouble, come
after me in the ship we rode up. But only if it's practical! Not
otherwise!"</p>

<p>The Chief said something in Mohawk. He sounded indignant.</p>

<p>The plastic walls of the lock swelled inward, burying and
overwhelming them. Pumps pounded briefly, removing what
air was left. Then the walls drew back, straining against their
netting, and Joe waited for the door to open to empty space.</p>

<p>Instead, there came a sharp voice in his helmet-phones. It
was Brown. "<i>Radar says there's a rocket on the way up! It's
over at what is the edge of the world from here. Three gravities
only. Better not go out!</i>"</p>

<p>Joe hesitated. Brown still issued no order. But defense
against a single rocket would be a matter of guided missiles&mdash;Brown's
business&mdash;if the tin can screen didn't handle it. Joe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
would have no part in it. He wouldn't be needed. He couldn't
help. And there'd be all the elaborate business of checking to
go through again. He said uncomfortably:</p>

<p>"It'll be a long time before it gets here&mdash;and three gravities
is low! Maybe it's a defective job. There have been misfires
and so on. It won't take long to try this wagon, anyhow.
They're anxious to send up a robot ship from the Shed and
these have to be tested first. Give me ten minutes."</p>

<p>He heard the Chief grumbling to himself. But one tested
space wagon was better than none.</p>

<p>The airlock doors opened. Huge round valves swung wide.
Bright, remote, swarming stars filled the opening. Joe cracked
the control of his forward liquid-fuel rockets. The lock filled
instantly with swirling fumes. And instantly the tiny space
wagon moved. It did not have to lift from the lock floor. Once
the magnetic clamps were released it was free of the floor. But
it did have mass. One brief push of the rockets sent it floating
out of the lock. It was in space. It kept on.</p>

<p>Joe felt a peculiar twinge of panic. Nobody who is accustomed
only to Earth can quite realize at the beginning the
conditions of handling vehicles in space. But Joe cracked
the braking rockets. He stopped. He hung seemingly motionless
in space. The Platform was a good half-mile away.</p>

<p>He tried the gyros, and the space wagon went into swift
spinning. He reversed them and straightened out&mdash;almost.
The vastness of all creation seemed still to revolve slowly
about him. The monstrous globe which was Earth moved
sedately from above his head to under his feet and continued
the slow revolution. The Platform rotated in a clockwise direction.
He was drifting very slowly away.</p>

<p>"Chief," he said wrily, "you can't do worse than I'm doing,
and we're rushed for time. You might come out. But listen!
You don't run your rockets! On Earth you keep a motor going
because when it stops, you do. But out here you have to use
your motor to stop, but not to keep on going. Get it? When
you do come out, don't burn your rockets more than half a
second at a time."</p>

<p>The Chief's voice came booming:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Right, Joe! Here I come!</i>"</p>

<p>There was a billowing of frantically writhing fumes, which
darted madly in every direction until they ceased to be. The
Chief in his insect-like contraption came bolting out of the
hole which was the airlock. He was a good half-mile away.
The rocket fumes ceased. He kept on going. Joe heard him
swear. The Chief felt the utterly helpless sensation of a man
in a car when his brakes don't work. But a moment later the
braking rockets did flare briefly, yet still too long. The Chief
was not only stopped, but drifting backwards toward the
Platform. He evidently tried to turn, and he spun as dizzily as
Joe had done. But after a moment he stopped&mdash;almost. There
were, then, two red-painted things in space, somewhat like
giant water-spiders floating forlornly in emptiness. They
seemed very remote from the great bright steel Platform and
that gigantic ball which was Earth, turning very slowly and
filling a good fourth of all that could be seen.</p>

<p>"Suppose you head toward me, Chief," said Joe absorbedly.
"Aim to pass, and remember that what you have to estimate
is not where I am, but where you have to put on the brakes
to stop close by. That's where you use your braking-rockets."</p>

<p>The Chief tried it. He came to a stop a quarter-mile past
Joe.</p>

<p>"<i>I'm heavy-handed</i>," said his voice disgustedly.</p>

<p>"I'll try to join you," said Joe.</p>

<p>He did try. He stopped a little short. The two weird objects
drifted almost together. The Chief was upside down with regard
to Joe. Presently he was sidewise on.</p>

<p>"This takes thinking," said Joe ruefully.</p>

<p>A voice in his headphones, from the Platform, said:</p>

<p>"<i>That rocket from Earth is still accelerating. Still at three
gravities. It looks like it isn't defective. It might be carrying
a man. Hadn't you better come in?</i>"</p>

<p>The Chief growled: "<i>We won't be any safer there! I want to
get the hang of this.</i>" Then his voice changed sharply. "<i>Joe!
D'you get that?</i>"</p>

<p>Joe heard his own voice, very cold.</p>

<p>"I didn't. I do now. Brown, I'd suggest a guided missile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
at that rocket coming up. If there's a man in it, he's coming
up to take over guided missiles that'll overtake him, and try
to smash the Platform by direct control, since proximity
fuses don't work. I'd smash him as far away as possible."</p>

<p>Brown's voice came very curt and worried. "<i>Right.</i>"</p>

<p>There was an eruption of rocket fumes from the side of the
Platform. Something went foaming away toward Earth. It
dwindled with incredible rapidity. Then Joe said:</p>

<p>"Chief, I think we'd better go down and meet that rocket.
We'll learn to handle these wagons on the way. I think we're
going to have a fight on our hands. Whoever's in that rocket
isn't coming up just to shake hands with us."</p>

<p>He steadied the small red vehicle and pointed it for Earth.
He added:</p>

<p>"I'm firing a six-two solid-fuel job, Chief. Counting three.
Three&mdash;two&mdash;one."</p>

<p>His mount vanished in rocket fumes. But after six seconds
at two gravities acceleration the rocket burned out. The
Chief had fired a matching rocket. They were miles apart, but
speeding Earthward on very nearly identical courses.</p>

<p>The Platform grew smaller. That was their only proof of
motion.</p>

<p>A very, very long time passed. The Chief fired his steering
rockets to bring him closer to Joe. It did not work. He had
to aim for Joe and fire a blast to move noticeably nearer.
Presently he would have to blast again to keep from passing.</p>

<p>Joe made calculations in his head. He worried. He and the
Chief were speeding Earthward&mdash;away from the Platform&mdash;at
more than four miles a minute, but it was not enough. The
manned rocket was accelerating at a great deal more than that
rate. And if the Platform's enemies down on Earth had sent
a manned rocket up to destroy the Platform, the man in it
would have ways of defending himself. He would expect
guided missiles&mdash;but he probably wouldn't expect to be attacked
by space wagons.</p>

<p>Joe said suddenly:</p>

<p>"Chief! I'm going to burn a twelve-two. We've got to
match velocities coming back. Join me? Three&mdash;two&mdash;one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>He fired a twelve-two. Twelve seconds burning, two gravities
acceleration. It built up his speed away from the Platform
to a rate which would have been breathless, on Earth. But
here there was no sensation of motion, and the distances were
enormous. Things which happen in space happen with insensate
violence and incredible swiftness. But long, long, long
intervals elapse between events. The twelve-two rocket burned
out. The Chief had matched that also.</p>

<p>Brown's voice in the headphones said, "<i>The rocket's cut
acceleration. It's floating up, now. It should reach our orbit
fifty miles behind us. But our missile should hit it in forty
seconds.</i>"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't bet on that," said Joe coldly. "Figure interception
data for the Chief and me. Make it fast!"</p>

<p>He spotted the Chief, a dozen miles away and burning his
steering rockets to close, again. The Chief had the hang of it,
now. He didn't try to steer. He drove toward Joe.</p>

<p>But nothing happened. And nothing happened. And nothing
happened. The two tiny space wagons were 90 miles from
the Platform, which was now merely a glittering speck, hardly
brighter than the brightest stars.</p>

<p>There was a flare of light to Earthward. It was brighter than
the sun. The light vanished.</p>

<p>Brown's voice came in the headphones, "<i>Our missile went
off 200 miles short! He sent an interceptor to set it off!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then he's dangerous," said Joe. "There'll be war rockets
coming up any second now for him to control from right at
hand. We won't be fighting rockets controlled from 4,000
miles away! They've found proximity fuses don't work, so he's
going to work in close. Give us our course and data, quick!
The Chief and I have got to try to smash things!"</p>

<p>The two tiny space wagons&mdash;like stick-insects in form, absurdly
painted a brilliant red&mdash;seemed inordinately lonely. It
was hardly possible to pick out the Platform with the naked
eyes. The Earth was thousands of miles below. Joe and the
Chief, in space suits, rode tiny metal frameworks in an emptiness
more vast, more lonely, more terrible than either could
have imagined.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the war rockets started up. There were eight of
them. They came out to do murder at ten gravities acceleration.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="c9" id="c9"></a><i>9</i></h2>


<p>But even at ten gravities' drive it takes time
to travel 4,000 miles. At three, and coasting a great deal of the
way, it takes much longer. The Platform circled Earth in
four hours and a little more. Anything intending interception
and rising straight up needed to start skyward long before
the Platform was overhead. A three-g rocket would start while
the Platform was still below the western horizon from its
launching-spot. Especially if it planned to coast part of its
journey&mdash;and a three-gravity rocket would have to coast most
of the way.</p>

<p>So there was time. Coasting, the rising manned rocket would
be losing speed. If it planned to go no higher than the Platform's
orbit, its upward velocity would be zero there. If it
were intercepted 500 miles down, it would be rising at an almost
leisurely rate, and Joe and the Chief could check their
Earthward plunge and match its rising rate.</p>

<p>This they did. But what they couldn't do was match its
orbital velocity, which was zero. They had the Platform's eastward
speed to start with&mdash;over 200 miles a minute. No matter
how desperately they fired braking-rockets, they couldn't stop
and maneuver around the rising control-ship. Inevitably they
would simply flash past it in the fraction of an instant. To fire
their tiny guided missiles on ahead would be almost to assure
that they would miss. Also, the enemy ship was manned. It
could fight back.</p>

<p>But Joe had been on the receiving end of one attack in
space. It wasn't much experience, but it was more than anybody
but he and his own crew possessed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Chief," said Joe softly into his helmet-mike, as if by
speaking softly he could keep from being overheard, "get
close enough to me to see what I do, and do it too. I can't tell
you more. Whoever's running this rocket might know English."</p>

<p>There was a flaring of vapor in space. The Chief was using
his steering-rockets to draw near.</p>

<p>Joe spun his little space wagon about, so that it pointed
back in the direction from which he had come. He had four
guided missiles, demolition type. Very deliberately, he fired
the four of them astern&mdash;away from the rising rocket. They
were relatively low-speed missiles, intended to blow up a
robot ship that couldn't be hooked onto, because it was
traveling too much faster or slower than the Platform it was
intended to reach. The missiles went away. Then Joe faced
about again in the direction of his prospective target. The
Chief fumed&mdash;Joe heard him&mdash;but he duplicated Joe's maneuver.
He faced his own eccentric vessel in the direction of
its line of flight.</p>

<p>Then his fuming suddenly ceased. Joe's headphones brought
his explosive grunt when he suddenly saw the idea.</p>

<p>"<i>Joe! I wish you could talk Indian! I could kiss you for this
trick!</i>"</p>

<p>Brown's voice said anxiously: "<i>I'm going to let that manned
rocket have a couple more shots.</i>"</p>

<p>"Let us get by first," said Joe. "Then maybe you can use
them on the bombs coming up."</p>

<p>He could see the trails of war-rockets on the way out from
Earth. They were infinitesimal threads of vapor. They were the
thinnest possible filaments of gossamer white. But they enlarged
as they rose. They were climbing at better than two
miles per second, now, and still increasing their speed.</p>

<p>But the arena in which this conflict took place was so vast
that everything seemed to take place in slow motion. There
was time to reason out not only the method of attack from
Earth, but the excuse for it. If the Platform vanished from
space, no matter from what cause, its enemies would announce
vociferously that it had been destroyed by its own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
atomic bombs, exploding spontaneously. Even in the face
of proof of murder, enemy nations would stridently insist that
bombs intended for the enslavement of humanity&mdash;in the
Platform&mdash;had providentially detonated and removed that
instrument of war-mongering scoundrelly imperialists from
the skies. There might be somebody, somewhere, who would
believe it.</p>

<p>Joe and the Chief were steadied now nearly on a line to
intercept the rising manned rocket. They had already fired
their missiles, which trailed them. They went into battle, not
prepared to shoot, but with their ammunition expended. For
which there was excellent reason.</p>

<p>Something came foaming toward them from the nearby
man-carrying rocket. It seemed like a side-spout from the
column of vapor rising from Earth. Actually it was a guided
missile.</p>

<p>"Now we dodge," said Joe cheerfully. "Remember the
trick of this maneuvering business!"</p>

<p>It was simple. Speeding toward the rising assassin, and
with his missiles rushing toward them, the relative speeds of
the wagons and the missiles were added together. If the space
wagons dodged, the missile operator had less time to swing
his guided rockets to match the change of target course. And
besides, the attacker hadn't made a single turn in space. Not
yet. He might know that a rocket doesn't go where it's pointed,
as a matter of theory. He might even know intellectually that
the final speed and course of a rocket is the sum of all its
previous speeds and courses. But he hadn't used the knowledge
Joe and the Chief had.</p>

<p>Something rushed at them. They went into evasive action.
And they didn't merely turn the noses of their space wagons.
They flung them about end-for-end, and blasted. They used
wholly different accelerations at odd angles. Joe shot away
from Earth on steering rocket thrust, and touched off a four-three
while he faced toward Earth's north pole, and halfway
along that four-second rush he flipped his craft in a somersault
and the result was nearly a right-angled turn. When the
four-three burned out he set off a twelve-two, and halfway<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
through its burning fired a three-two with it, so that at the
beginning he had two gravities acceleration, then four gravities
for three seconds, and then two again.</p>

<p>With long practice, a man might learn marksmanship in
space. But all a man's judgment of speeds is learned on
Earth, where things always, always, always move steadily.
Nobody making his first space-flight could possibly hit such
targets as Joe and the Chief made of themselves. The man in
the enemy rocket was making his first flight. Also, Joe and
the Chief had an initial velocity of 200 miles a minute toward
him. The marksman in the rising rocket hadn't a chance.
He fired four more missiles and tried desperately to home them
in. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They flashed past his rising course. And then they were
quite safe from his fire, because it would take a very long time
indeed for anything he shot after them to catch up. But their
missiles had still to pass him&mdash;and Joe and the Chief could
steer them without any concern about their own safety or
anything else but a hit.</p>

<p>They made a hit.</p>

<p>Two of the eight little missiles flashed luridly, almost together,
where the radar-pips showed the rocket to be. Then
there were two parts to the rocket, separating. One was small
and one was fairly large. Another demolition-missile hit the
larger section. Still another exploded as that was going to
pieces. The smaller fragment ceased to be important. The
explosions weren't atomic bombs, of course. They were only
demolition-charges. But they demolished the manned rocket
admirably.</p>

<p>Brown's voice came in the headphones, still tense. "<i>You
got it! How about the others?</i>"</p>

<p>Joe felt a remarkable exhilaration. Later he might think
about the poor devil&mdash;there could have been only one&mdash;who
had been destroyed some 3,700 miles above the surface of
the Earth. He might think unhappily of that man as a victim
of hatred rather than as a hater. He might become extremely
uncomfortable about this, but at the moment he felt merely
that he and the Chief had won a startling victory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think," he said, "that you can treat them with silent contempt.
They won't have proximity fuses. Those friends of
ours who want so badly to kill us have found that proximity
fuses don't work. Unless one is on a collision course I don't
think you need to do anything about them."</p>

<p>The Chief was muttering to himself in Mohawk, twenty
miles away. Joe said:</p>

<p>"Chief, how about getting back to the Platform?"</p>

<p>The Chief growled. "<i>My great-grandfather would disown
me! Winning a fight and no scalp to show! Not even counting
coup! He'd disown me!</i>"</p>

<p>But Joe saw his rockets flare, away off against the stars.</p>

<p>The war rockets were very near, now. They still emitted
monstrous jettings of thick white vapor. They climbed up with
incredible speed. One went by Joe at a distance of little more
than a mile, and its fumes eddied out to half that before they
thinned to nothingness. They went on and on and on....</p>

<p>They burned out somewhere. It would be a long time before
they fell back to Earth. Hours, probably. Then they would
be meteors. They'd vaporize before they touched solidity.
They wouldn't even explode.</p>

<p>But Joe and the Chief rode back to the Platform. It was
surprising how hard it was to match speed with it again, to
make a good entrance into the giant lock. They barely made
it before the Platform made its plunge into that horrible
blackness which was the Earth's shadow. And Joe was very
glad they did make it before then. He wouldn't have liked to
be merely astride a skinny framework in that ghastly darkness,
with the monstrous blackness of the Abyss seeming to be
trying to devour him.</p>

<p>Haney met them in the airlock. He grinned.</p>

<p>"Nice job, Joe! Nice job, Chief!" he said warmly. "Uh&mdash;the
Lieutenant Commander wants you to report to him, Joe. Right
away."</p>

<p>Joe cocked an eyebrow at him.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>Haney spread out his hands. The Chief grunted. "That guy
bothers me. I'll bet, Joe, he's going to explain you shouldn't've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
gone out when he didn't want you to. Me, I'm keeping away
from him!"</p>

<p>The Chief shed his space suit and swaggered away, as well
as anyone could swagger while walking on what happened
to be the ceiling, from Joe's point of view. Joe put his space
gear in its proper place. He went to the small cubbyhole that
Brown had appropriated for the office of the Platform Commander.
Joe went in, naturally without saluting.</p>

<p>Brown sat in a fastened-down chair with thigh grips holding
him in place. He was writing. On Joe's entry, he carefully
put the pen down on a magnetized plate that would hold it
until he wanted it again. Otherwise it could have floated anywhere
about the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenmore," said Brown awkwardly, "you did a very
nice piece of work. It's too bad you aren't in the Navy."</p>

<p>Joe said: "It did work out pretty fortunately. It's lucky the
Chief and I were out practicing, but now we can take off when
a rocket's reported, any time."</p>

<p>Brown cleared his throat. "I can thank you personally," he
said unhappily, "and I do. But&mdash;really this situation is intolerable!
How can I report this affair? I can't suggest commendation,
or a promotion, or&mdash;anything! I don't even know how to
refer to you! I am going to ask you, Mr. Kenmore, to put
through a request that your status be clarified. I would imagine
that your status would mean a rank&mdash;hm&mdash;about equivalent
to a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy."</p>

<p>Joe grinned.</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;ah&mdash;prepared a draft you might find helpful," said
Brown earnestly. "It's necessary for something to be done.
It's urgent! It's important!"</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Joe. "The important thing to me is getting
ready to load up the Platform with supplies from Earth.
Excuse me."</p>

<p>He went out of the office. He made his way to the quarters
assigned himself and his crew. Mike greeted him with reproachful
eyes. Joe waved his hand.</p>

<p>"Don't say it, Mike! The answer is yes. See that the tanks
are refilled, and new rockets put in place. Then you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Haney go out and practice. But no farther than ten miles from
the Platform. Understand?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Mike rebelliously. "It's a dirty trick!"</p>

<p>"Which," Joe assured him, "I commit only because there's
a robot ship from Bootstrap coming up any time now. And
we'll need to pick it up and tow it here."</p>

<p>He went to the control-room to see if he could get a vision
connection to Earth.</p>

<p>He got the beam, and he got Sally on the screen. A report
of the attack on the Platform had evidently already gone
down to Earth. Sally's expression was somehow drawn and
haunted. But she tried to talk lightly.</p>

<p>"Derring-do and stuff, Joe?" she asked. "How does it feel
to be a victorious warrior?"</p>

<p>"It feels rotten," he told her. "There must have been somebody
in the rocket we blew up. He felt like a patriot, I guess,
trying to murder us; But I feel like a butcher."</p>

<p>"Maybe you didn't do it," she said. "Maybe the Chief's
bombs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Joe. He hesitated. "Hold up your hand."</p>

<p>She held it up. His ring was still on it. She nodded. "Still
there. When will you be back?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. He didn't know. It was curious that
one wanted so badly to talk to a girl after doing something
that was blood-stirring&mdash;and left one rather sickish afterward.
This business of space travel and even space battle was what
he'd dreamed of, and he still wanted it. But it was very comforting
to talk to Sally, who hadn't had to go through any of it.</p>

<p>"Write me a letter, will you?" he asked. "We can't tie up
this beam very long."</p>

<p>"I'll write you all the news that's allowed to go out," she
assured him. "Be seeing you, Joe."</p>

<p>Her image faded from the screen. And, thinking it over, he
couldn't see that either of them had said anything of any
importance at all. But he was very glad they'd talked together.</p>

<p>The first robot ship came up some eight hours later&mdash;two
revolutions after the television call. Mike was ready hours in
advance, fidgeting. The robot ship started up while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Platform was over the middle of the Pacific. It didn't try to
make a spiral approach as all other ships had done. It came
straight up, and it started from the ground. No pushpots. Its
take-off rockets were monsters. They pushed upward at ten
gravities until it was out of atmosphere, and then they stepped
up to fifteen. Much later, the robot turned on its side and fired
orbital speed rockets to match velocity with the Platform.</p>

<p>There were two reasons for the vertical rise, and the high
acceleration. If a robot ship went straight up, it wouldn't
pass over enemy territory until it was high enough to be protected
by the Platform. And&mdash;it costs fuel to carry fuel to be
burned. So if the rocketship could get up speed for coasting
to orbit in the first couple of hundred miles, it needn't haul its
fuel so far. It was economical to burn one's fuel fast and get
an acceleration that would kill a human crew. Hence robots.</p>

<p>The landing of the first robot ship at the Platform was almost
as matter-of-fact as if it had been done a thousand
times before. From the Platform its dramatic take-off couldn't
be seen, of course. It first appeared aloft as a pip on a radar
screen. Then Mike prepared to go out and hook on to it and
tow it in. He was in his space suit and in the landing lock,
though his helmet faceplate was still open. A <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: Hyphen removed to conform to the majority usage.">loudspeaker</ins>
boomed suddenly in Brown's voice: "<i>Evacuate airlock and prepare
to take off!</i>"</p>

<p>Joe roared: "Hold that!"</p>

<p>Brown's voice, very official, came: "<i>Withhold execution of
that order. You should not be in the airlock, Mr. Kenmore.
You will please make way for operational procedure.</i>"</p>

<p>"We're checking the space wagon," snapped Joe. "That's
operational procedure!"</p>

<p>The loudspeaker said severely: "<i>The checking should have
been done earlier!</i>"</p>

<p>There was silence. Mike and Joe, together, painstakingly
checked over the very many items that had to be made sure.
Every rocket had to have its firing circuit inspected. The
tanks' contents and pressure verified. The air connection to
Mike's space suit. The air pressure. The device that made
sure that air going to Mike's space suit was neither as hot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
as metal in burning sunlight, nor cold as the chill of a shadow
in space.</p>

<p>Everything checked. Mike straddled his red-painted mount.
Joe left the lock and said curtly:</p>

<p>"Okay to pump the airlock. Okay to open airlock doors
when ready. Go ahead."</p>

<p>Mike went out, and Joe watched from a port in the Platform's
hull. The drone from Earth was five miles behind the
Platform in its orbit, and twenty miles below, and all of ten
miles off-course. Joe saw Mike scoot the red space wagon to
it, stop short with a sort of cocky self-assurance, hook on to
the tow-ring in the floating space-barge's nose, and blast
off back toward the Platform with it in tow.</p>

<p>Mike had to turn about and blast again to check his motion
when he arrived. And then he and Haney&mdash;Haney in the other
space wagon&mdash;nudged at it and tugged at it and got it in the
great spacelock. They went in after it and the lock doors
closed.</p>

<p>Neither Mike nor Haney were out of their space suits when
Kent brought Joe a note. A note was an absurdity in the
Platform. But this was a formal communication from Brown.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>From: Lt. Comdr. Brown</i></p>

<p><i>To: Mr. Kenmore</i></p>

<p><i>Subject: Cooperation and courtesy in rocket recovery vehicle launchings.</i></p>

<ol style="font-style: italic;">
<li>There is a regrettable lack of coordination and courtesy
in the launching of rocket-recovery vehicles (space
wagons) in the normal operation of the Platform.</li>

<li>The maintenance of discipline and efficiency requires
that the commanding officer maintain overall control
of all operations at all times.</li>

<li>Hereafter when a space vehicle of any type is to be
launched, the commanding officer will be notified in
writing not less than one hour before such launching.</li>

<li>The time of such proposed launching will be given in
such notification in hours and minutes and seconds,
Greenwich Mean Time.</li>

<li><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>All commands for launching will be given by the commanding
officer or an officer designated by him."</li>
</ol></div>

<p>Joe received the memo as he was in the act of writing a
painstaking report on the maneuver Mike had carried out.
Mike was radiant as he discussed possible improvements with
later and better equipment. After all, this had been a lucky
landing. For a robot to end up no more than 30 miles from
its target, after a journey of 4,000 miles, and with a difference
in velocity that was almost immeasurable&mdash;such good fortune
couldn't be expected as a regular thing. The space wagons
were tiny. If they had to travel long distances to recover erratic
ships coming up from Earth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Joe forgot all about Lieutenant Commander Brown and
his memo when the mail was distributed. Joe had three letters
from Sally. He read them in the great living compartment of
the Platform with its sixty-foot length and its carpet on floor
and ceiling, and the galleries without stairs outside the sleeping
cabins. He sat in a chair with thigh grips to hold him in
place, and he wore a gravity simulation harness. It was necessary.
The regular crew of the Platform, by this time, couldn't
have handled space wagons in action against enemy manned
rockets. Joe meant to stay able to take acceleration.</p>

<p>It was just as he finished his mail that Brent came in.</p>

<p>"Big news!" said Brent. "They're building a big new ship
of new design&mdash;almost half as big as the Platform. With concreted
metal they can do it in weeks."</p>

<p>"What's it for?" demanded Joe.</p>

<p>"It'll be a human base on the Moon," said Brent relievedly.
"An expedition will start in six weeks, according to plan. As
long as we're the only American base in space, we're going to
be shot at. But a base on the Moon will be invulnerable. So
they're going ahead with it."</p>

<p>Joe said hopefully:</p>

<p>"Any orders for me to join it?"</p>

<p>Brent shook his head. "We're to be loaded up with supplies
for the Moon expedition. We're to be ready to take a robot ship
every round. Actually, they can't hope to send us more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
two a day for a while, but even that'll be eighty tons of supplies
to be stored away."</p>

<p>The Chief grumbled, but somehow his grumbling did not
sound genuine. "They're going to the Moon&mdash;and leave us
here to do stevedore stuff?" His tone was odd. He looked
at a letter he'd been reading and gave up pretense. He said
self-consciously: "Listen, you guys.... My tribe's got all excited.
I just got a letter from the council. They've been having
an argument about me. Wanna hear?"</p>

<p>He was a little amused, and a little embarrassed, but something
had happened to make him feel good.</p>

<p>"Let's have it," said Joe. Mike was very still in another
chair. He didn't look up, though he must have heard. Haney
cocked an interested ear.</p>

<p>The Chief said awkwardly, "You know&mdash;us Mohawks are
kinda proud. We got something to be proud of. We were
one of the Five Nations, when that was a sort of United Nations
and all Europe was dog-eat-dog. My tribe had a big pow-wow
about me. There's a tribe member that's a professor of
anthropology out in Chicago. He was there. And a couple of
guys that do electronic research, and doctors and farmers and
all sorts of guys. All Mohawks. They got together in tribal
council."</p>

<p>He stopped and flushed under his dark skin. "I wouldn't
tell you, only you guys are in on it."</p>

<p>Still he hesitated. Joe found a curious picture forming in
his mind. He'd known the Chief a long time, and he knew
that part of the tribe lived in Brooklyn, and individual members
were widely scattered. But still there was a certain remote
village which to all the tribesmen was home. Everybody
went back there from time to time, to rest from the
strangeness of being Indians in a world of pale-skinned folk.</p>

<p>Joe could almost imagine the council. There'd be old, old
men who could nearly remember the days of the tribe's former
glory, who'd heard stories of forest warfare and zestful hunts,
and scalpings and heroic deeds from their grandfathers. But
there were also doctors and lawyers and technical men in that
council which met to talk about the Chief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's addressed to me," said the Chief with sudden clumsiness,
"in the World-by-itself Canoe. That's the Platform here.
And it says&mdash;I'll have to translate, because it's in Mohawk."
He took a deep breath. "It says, 'We your tribesmen have
heard of your journeyings off the Earth where men have never
traveled before. This has given us great pride, that one of
our tribe and kin had ventured so valiantly.'" The Chief
grinned abashedly. He went on. "'In full assembly, the
elders of the tribe have held counsel on a way to express their
pride in you, and in the friends you have made who accompanied
you. It was proposed that you be given a new
name to be borne by your sons after you. It was proposed
that the tribe accept from each of its members a gift to be
given you in the name of the tribe. But these were not considered
great enough. Therefore the tribe, in full council, has
decreed that your name shall be named at every tribal council
of the Mohawks from this day to the end of time, as one the
young braves would do well to copy in all ways. And the
names of your friends Joe Kenmore, Mike Scandia, and
Thomas Haney shall also be named as friends whose like all
young braves should strive to seek out and to be.'"</p>

<p>The Chief sweated a little, but he looked enormously
proud. Joe went over to him and shook hands warmly. The
Chief almost broke his fingers. It was, of course, as high an
honor as could be paid to anybody by the people who paid it.</p>

<p>Haney said awkwardly, "Lucky they don't know me like you
do, Chief. But it's swell!"</p>

<p>Which it was. But Mike hadn't said a word. The Chief
said exuberantly:</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, Mike? Every Mohawk for ten thousand
years is gonna be told that you were a swell guy! Crazy, huh?"</p>

<p>Mike said in an odd voice: "Yeah. I didn't mean that, Chief.
It's fine! But I&mdash;I got a letter. I&mdash;never thought to get a letter
like this."</p>

<p>He looked unbelievingly at the paper in his hands.</p>

<p>"Mash note?" asked the Chief. His tone was a little bit harsh.
Mike was a midget. And there were women who were fools.
It would be unbearable if some half-witted female had written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Mike the sort of gushing letter that some half-witted females
might write.</p>

<p>Mike shook his head, with an odd, quick smile.</p>

<p>"Not what you think, Chief. But it is from a girl. She sent
me her picture. It's a&mdash;swell letter. I'm&mdash;going to answer it.
You can look at her picture. She looks kind of&mdash;nice."</p>

<p>He handed the Chief a snapshot. The Chief's face changed.
Haney looked over his shoulder. He passed the picture to Joe
and said ferociously: "You Mike! You doggoned Don Juan!
The Chief and me have got to warn her what kinda guy you
are! Stealing from blind men! Fighting cops&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Joe looked at the picture. It was a very sweet small face,
and the eyes that looked out of the photograph were very
honest and yearning. And Joe understood. He grinned at
Mike. Because this girl had the distinctive look that Mike
had. She was a midget, too.</p>

<p>"She's&mdash;<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: The original reads 'thiry-nine'.">thirty-nine</ins> inches tall," said Mike, almost stunned.
"She's just two inches shorter than me. And&mdash;she says she
doesn't mind being a midget so much since she heard about
me. I'm going to write her."</p>

<p>But it would be, of course, a long time before there was a
way for mail to get down to Earth.</p>

<p>It was a long time. Now it was possible to send up robot
rockets to the Platform. They came up. When the second arrived,
Haney went out to pull it in. Joe forgot to notify Brown,
in writing, an hour before launching a rocket recovery vehicle
(space wagon) according to paragraph 3 of the formal memo,
nor the time of launching in hours, minutes, etc., by Greenwich
Mean Time (paragraph 4), nor was the testing of all equipment
made before moving it into the airlock. This was because
the testing equipment was in the airlock, where it belonged.
And the commands for launching were not given by
Brown or an officer designated by him, because Joe forgot all
about it.</p>

<p>Brown made a stormy scene about the matter, and Joe was
honestly apologetic, but the Chief and Haney and Mike glared
venomously.</p>

<p>The result was completely inconclusive. Joe had not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
put under Brown's command. He and his crew were the only
people on the Platform physically in shape to operate the
space wagons, considering the acceleration involved. Brent
and the others were wearing gravity simulators, and were
building back to strength. But they weren't up to par as yet.
They'd been in space too long.</p>

<p>So there was nothing Brown could do. He retreated into
icily correct, outraged dignity. And the others hauled in and
unloaded rockets as they arrived. They came up fast. The
processes of making them had been improved. They could be
made faster, heated to sintering temperature faster, and the
hulls cooled to usefulness in a quarter of the former time. The
production of space ship hulls went up to four a day, while
the molds for the Moonship were being worked even faster.
The Moonship, actually, was assembled from precast individual
cells which then were welded together. It would have
features the Platform lacked, because it was designed to be a
base for exploration and military activities in addition to research.</p>

<p>But only twenty days after the recovery and docking of the
first robot ship to rise, a new sort of ship entirely came blindly
up as a robot. The little space wagons hauled it to the airlock
and inside. They unloaded it&mdash;and it was no longer a robot. It
was a modified hull designed for the duties of a tug in space.
It could carry a crew of four, and its cargohold was accessible
from the cabin. It had an airlock. More, it carried a cargo of
solid-fuel rockets which could be shifted to firing racks outside
its hull. Starting from the platform, where it had no effective
weight, it was capable of direct descent to the Earth without
spiralling or atmospheric braking. To make that descent it
would, obviously, expend four-fifths of its loaded weight in
rockets. And since it had no weight at the Platform, but only
mass, it was capable of far-ranging journeying. It could literally
take off from the Platform and reach the Moon and land
on it, and then return to the Platform.</p>

<p>But that had to wait.</p>

<p>"Sure we could do it," agreed Joe, when Mike wistfully
pointed out the possibility. "It would be good to try it. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
unfortunately, space exploration isn't a stunt. We've gotten
this far because&mdash;somebody wanted to do something. But&mdash;&mdash;"
Then he said, "It could be done and the United Nations
wouldn't do it. So the United States had to, or&mdash;somebody
else would have. You can figure who that would be, and what
use they'd make of space travel! So it's important. It's more
important than stunt flights we could make!"</p>

<p>"Nobody could stop us if we wanted to take off!" Mike said
rebelliously.</p>

<p>"True," Joe said. "But we four can stand three gravities
acceleration and handle any more manned rockets that start
out here. We've lived through plenty more than that! But
Brent and the others couldn't put up a fight in space. They're
wearing harness now, and they're coming back to strength.
But we're going to stay right here and do stevedoring&mdash;and
fighting too, if it comes to that&mdash;until the job is done."</p>

<p>And that was the way it was, too. Of stevedoring there was
plenty. Two robot ships a day for weeks on end. Three ships
a day for a time. Four. Sometimes things went smoothly, and
the little space wagons could go out and bring back the great,
rocket-scarred hulls from Earth. But once in three times the
robots were going too fast or too slow. The space wagons
couldn't handle them. Then the new ship, the space tug, went
out and hooked onto the robot with a chain and used the power
it had to bring them to their destination. And sometimes the
robots didn't climb straight. At least once the space tug captured
an erratic robot 400 miles from its destination and
hauled it in. It used some heavy solid-fuel rockets on that trip.</p>

<p>The Platform had become, in fact, a port in space, though
so far it had had only arrivals and no departures. Its storage
compartments almost bulged with fuel stores and food stores
and equipment of every imaginable variety. It had a stock
of rockets which were enough to land it safely on Earth,
though there was surely no intention of doing so. It had food
and air for centuries. It had repair parts for all its own equipment.
And it had weapons. It contained, in robot hulls anchored
to its sides, enough fissionable material to conduct a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
deadly war&mdash;which was only stored for transfer to the Moon
base when that should be established.</p>

<p>And it had communication with Earth of high quality. So
far the actual mail was only a one-way service, but even entertainment
came up, and news. Once there was a television
shot of the interior of the Shed. It was carefully scrambled before
transmission, but it was a heartening sight. The Shed on
the TV screen appeared a place of swarming activity. Robot
hulls were being made. They were even improved, fined
down to ten tons of empty weight apiece, and their controls
were assembly line products now. And there was the space
flight simulator with men practicing in it, although for the
time being only robots were taking off from Earth. And there
was the Moonship.</p>

<p>It didn't look like the Platform, but rather like something
a child might have put together out of building blocks. It was
built up out of welded-together cells with strengthening members
added. It was 60 feet high from the floor and twice as
long, and it did not weigh nearly what it seemed to. Already
it was being clad in that thick layer of heat insulation it would
need to endure the two-week-long lunar night. It could take
off very soon now.</p>

<p>The pictured preparations back on Earth meant round-the-clock
drudgery for Joe and the others. They wore themselves
out. But the storage space on the Platform filled up. Days and
weeks went by. Then there came a time when literally nothing
else could be stored, so Joe and his crew made ready to go
back to Earth.</p>

<p>They ate hugely and packed a very small cargo in their
ship. They picked up one bag of mail and four bags of scientific
records and photographs which had only been transmitted
by facsimile TV before. They got into the space tug. It
floated free.</p>

<p>"<i>You will fire in ten seconds</i>," said a crisp voice in Joe's
headphones. "<i>Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six
... five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... fire!</i>"</p>

<p>Joe crooked his index finger. There was an explosive jolt.
Rockets flamed terribly in emptiness. The space tug rushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
toward the west. The Platform seemed to dwindle with startling
suddenness. It seemed to rush away and become lost in
the myriads of stars. The space tug accelerated at four gravities
in the direction opposed to its orbital motion.</p>

<p>As the acceleration built up, it dropped toward Earth and
home like a tumbled stone.</p>

<h2><a name="c10" id="c10"></a>10</h2>


<p>There was bright sunshine at the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: The original reads 'shed'.">Shed</ins>, not a
single cloud in all the sky. The radar bowls atop the roof&mdash;they
seemed almost invisibly small compared with its vastness&mdash;wavered
and shifted and quivered. Completely invisible
beams of microwaves lanced upward. Atop the Shed, in
the communication room, there was the busy quiet of absolute
intentness. Signals came down and were translated into visible
records which fed instantly into computers. Then the computers
clicked and hummed and performed incomprehensible
integrations, and out of their slot-mouths poured billowing
ribbons of printed tape. Men read those tapes and talked
crisply into microphones, and their words went swiftly aloft
again.</p>

<p>Down by the open eastern door of the Shed at the desert's
edge, Sally Holt and Joe's father waited together, watching
the sky. Sally was white and scared. Joe's father patted her
shoulder reassuringly.</p>

<p>"He'll make it, all right," said Sally, dry-throated.</p>

<p>Joe's father nodded. "Of course he will!" But his voice was
not steady.</p>

<p>"Nothing could happen to him now!" said Sally fiercely.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Joe's father.</p>

<p>A loudspeaker close to them said abruptly: "<i>Nineteen
miles.</i>"</p>

<p>There was a tiny, straggling thread of white visible in the
now. It thinned out to nothingness, but its nearest part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
flared out and flared out and flared out. It grew larger, came
closer with a terrifying speed.</p>

<p>"<i>Twelve miles</i>," said the speaker harshly. "<i>Rockets firing.</i>"</p>

<p>The downward-hurtling trail of smoke was like a crippled
plane falling flaming from the sky, except that no plane ever
fell so fast.</p>

<p>At seven miles the white-hot glare of the rocket flames was
visible even in broad daylight. At three miles the light was unbearably
bright. At two, the light winked out. Sally saw something
which glittered come plummeting toward the ground,
unsupported.</p>

<p>It fell almost half a mile before rocket fumes flung furiously
out again. Then it checked. Visibly, its descent was
slowed. It dropped more slowly, and more slowly, and more
slowly still....</p>

<p>It hung in mid-air a quarter-mile up. Then there was a
fresh burst of rocket fumes, more monstrous than ever, and it
went steadily downward, touched the ground, and stayed
there spurting terrible incandescent flames for seconds. Then
the bottom flame went out. An instant later there were no
more flames at all.</p>

<p>Sally began to run toward the ship. She stopped. A procession
of rumbling, clanking, earth-moving machinery moved
out of the Shed and toward the upright space tug. Prosaically,
a bulldozer lowered its wide blade some fifty yards from the
ship. It pushed a huge mass of earth before it, covering over
the scorched and impossibly hot sand about the rocket's
landing place. Other bulldozers began to circle methodically
around and around, overturning the earth and burying the
hot surface stuff. Water trucks sprayed, and thin steam arose.</p>

<p>But also an exit-port opened and Joe stood in the opening.</p>

<p>Then Sally began to run again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Joe sat at dinner in the major's quarters. Major Holt was
there, and Joe's father, and Sally.</p>

<p>"It feels good," said Joe warmly, "to use a knife and fork
again, and to pick food up from a plate where it stays until
it's picked up!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"The crew of the Platform&mdash;&mdash;" Major Holt began.</p>

<p>"They're all right," said Joe, with his mouth full. "They're
wearing gravity simulator harness. Brent's got his up to three-quarters
gravity. They get tired, wearing the harness. They
sleep better. Everything's fine! They can handle the space
wagons we left and they've got guided missiles to spare!
They're all right!"</p>

<p>Joe's father said unsteadily, "You'll stay on Earth a while
now, son?"</p>

<p>Sally moved quickly. She looked up, tense. But Joe said,
"They're going to get the Moonship up, sir. We came back&mdash;my
gang and me&mdash;to help train the crew. We only have a week
to do it in, but we've got some combat tactics to show them on
the training gadget in the Shed." He added anxiously, "And,
sir&mdash;they'll have to take the Moonship off in a spiral orbit. She
can't go straight up! That means she's got to pass over enemy
territory, and&mdash;we've got to have a real escort for her. A
fighting escort. It's planned for the space tug to take off a
few minutes after the Moonship and blast along underneath.
We'll dump guided missiles out&mdash;like drones&mdash;and if anything
comes along we can start their rockets and fight our way
through. And we four have had more experience than anybody
else. We're needed!"</p>

<p>"You've done enough, surely!" Sally cried.</p>

<p>"The United States," said Joe awkwardly, "is going to take
over the Moon. I&mdash;can't miss having a hand in that! Not if it's
at all possible!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will miss it, Joe," Major Holt said detachedly.
"The occupation of the Moon will be a Navy enterprise.
Space Exploration Project facilities are being used to prepare
for it, but the Navy won the latest battle of the Pentagon. The
Navy takes over the Moon."</p>

<p>Joe looked startled. "But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're Space Exploration personnel," said the major with
the same coolness. "You will be used to instruct naval personnel,
and your space tug will be asked to go along to the
Platform as an auxiliary vessel. For purposes of assisting in
the landing of the Moonship at the Platform, you understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
You'll haul her away from the Platform when she's refueled
and supplied, so she can start off for the Moon. But the occupation
of the Moon will be strictly Navy."</p>

<p>Joe's expression became carefully unreadable. "I think," he
said evenly, "I'd better not comment."</p>

<p>Major Holt nodded. "Very wise&mdash;not that we'd repeat anything
you did say. But the point is, Joe, that just one day before
the Moonship does take off, the United Nations will be
informed that it is a United States naval vessel. The doctrine of
the freedom of space&mdash;like the freedom of the seas&mdash;will be
promulgated. And the United States will say that a United
States naval task force is starting off into space on an official
mission. To attack a Space Exploration ship is one thing.
That's like a scientific expedition. But to fire on an American
warship on official business is a declaration of war. Especially
since that ship can shoot back&mdash;and will."</p>

<p>Joe listened. He said, "It's daring somebody to try another
Pearl Harbor?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the major. "It's time for us to be firm&mdash;now
that we can back it up. I don't think the Moonship will be
fired on."</p>

<p>"But they'll need me and my gang just the same," said Joe
slowly, "for tugboat work at the Platform?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the major.</p>

<p>"Then," Joe said doggedly, "they get us. My gang will
gripe about being edged out of the trip. They won't like it.
But they'd like backing out still less. We'll play it the way it's
dealt&mdash;but we won't pretend to like it."</p>

<p>Major Holt's expression did not change at all, but Joe had an
odd feeling that the major approved of him.</p>

<p>"Yes. That's right, Joe," his father added. "You&mdash;you'll have
to go aloft once more, son. After that, we'll talk it over."</p>

<p>Sally hadn't said a word during the discussion, but she'd
watched Joe every second. Later, out on the porch of the
major's quarters, she had a great deal to say. But that couldn't
affect the facts.</p>

<p>The world at large, of course, received no inkling of the
events in preparation. The Shed and the town of Bootstrap and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
all the desert for a hundred-mile circle round about, were absolutely
barred to all visitors. Anybody who came into that
circle stayed in. Most people were kept out. All that anyone
outside could discover was that enormous quantities of cryptic
material had poured and still were pouring into the Shed. But
this time security was genuinely tight. Educated guesses could
be made, and they were made; but nobody outside the closed-in
area save a very few top-ranking officials had any real
knowledge. The world only knew that something drastic and
remarkable was in prospect.</p>

<p>Mike, though, was able to write a letter to the girl who'd
written him. Major Holt arranged it. Mike wrote his letter on
paper supplied by Security, with ink supplied by Security,
and while watched by Security officers. His letter was censored
by Major Holt himself, and it did not reveal that Mike
was back on Earth. But it did invite a reply&mdash;and Mike
sweated as he waited for one.</p>

<p>The others had plenty to sweat about. Joe and Haney and
the Chief were acting as instructors to the Moonship's crew.
They taught practical space navigation. At first they thought
they hadn't much to pass on, but they found out otherwise.
They had to pass on data on everything from how to walk to
how to drink coffee, how to eat, sleep, why one should wear
gravity harness, and the manners and customs of ships in
space. They had to show why in space fighting a ship might
send missiles on before it, but would really expect to do damage
with those it left behind. They had to warn of the dangers
of unshielded sunshine, and the equal danger of standing in
shadow for more than five minutes, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They had material for six months of instruction courses, but
there was barely a week to pass it on. Joe was run ragged, but
in spite of everything he managed to talk at some length with
Sally. He found himself curiously anxious to discuss any number
of things with his father, too, who suddenly appeared to
be much more intelligent than Joe had ever noticed before.</p>

<p>He was almost unhappy when it was certain that the Moonship
would take off for space on the following day. He talked
about it with Sally the night before take-off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look," he said awkwardly. "As far as I'm concerned this
has turned out a pretty sickly business. But when we have got
a base on the Moon, it'll be a good job done. There will be
one thing that nobody can stop! Everybody's been living in
terror of war. If we hold the Moon the cold war will be ended.
You can't kick on my wanting to help end that!"</p>

<p>Sally smiled at him in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;meanwhile," said Joe clumsily, "well&mdash;when I come
back we can do some serious talking about&mdash;well&mdash;careers and
such things. Until then&mdash;no use. Right?"</p>

<p>Sally's smile wavered. "Very sensible," she agreed wrily.
"And awfully silly, Joe. I know what kind of a career I want!
What other fascinating topic do you know to talk about, Joe?"</p>

<p>"I don't know of any. Oh, yes! Mike got a letter from his
girl. I don't know what she said, but he's walking on air."</p>

<p>"But it isn't funny!" said Sally indignantly. "Mike's a person!
A fine person! If he'll let me, I'll write to his girl myself and&mdash;try
to make friends with her so when you come back I&mdash;maybe
I can be a sort of match-maker."</p>

<p>"That, I like!" Joe said warmly. "You're swell sometimes,
Sally!"</p>

<p>Sally looked at him enigmatically in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"There are times when it seems to escape your attention,"
she observed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next morning she cried a little when he left her, to
climb in the space tug which was so small a part of today's
activity. Joe and his crew were the only living men who had
ever made a round trip to the Platform and back. But now
there was the Moonship to go farther than they'd been allowed.
It was even clumsier in design than the Platform,
though it was smaller. But it wasn't designed to stay in space.
It was to rest on the powdery floor of a ring-mountain's central
plain.</p>

<p>Let it get off into space, and somehow get to the Platform
to reload. Then let it replace the rockets it would burn in this
take-off and it could go on out to emptiness. It would make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
history as the first serious attempt by human beings to reach
the Moon.</p>

<p>Joe and his followers would go along simply to handle
guided missiles if it came to a fight, and to tow the Moonship
to its wharf&mdash;the Platform&mdash;and out into midstream again when
it resumed its journey. And that was all.</p>

<p>The Moonship lifted from the floor of the Shed to the sound
of hundreds of pushpot engines.</p>

<p>Then the space tug roared skyward. Her take-off rockets
here substituted for the pushpots. Her second-stage rockets
were also of the nonpoisonous variety, because she fired them
at a bare 60,000 feet. They were substitutes for the jatos the
pushpots carried.</p>

<p>She was out in space when the third-stage rockets roared
dully outside her hull.</p>

<p>When the Moonship crossed the west coast of Africa, the
space tug was 400 miles below and 500 miles behind. When
the Moonship crossed Arabia, the difference was 200 miles
vertically and less than 100 in line.</p>

<p>Then the Moonship released small objects, steadied by gyroscopes
and flung away by puffs of compressed air. The small
objects spread out. Haney and Mike and the Chief had reloaded
the firing racks from inside the ship, and now were
intent upon control boards and radar. They pressed buttons.
One by one, little puffs of smoke appeared in space. They had
armed the little space missiles, setting off tiny flares which had
no function except to prove that each missile was ready for use.</p>

<p>By the time the two space craft floated toward India, above
an area from which war rockets had been known to rise, there
were more little weapons floating with them. One screen of
missiles hurtled on before the space tug, and another behind.
Anything that came up from Earth would instantly be attacked
by dozens of midget ships bent upon suicide.</p>

<p>Radar probed the space formation, but enemies of the fleet
and the Platform very wisely did no more than probe. The
Moonship and its attendants went across the Pacific, still rising.
Above the longitude of Washington, the space tug left its
former post and climbed, nudging the Moonship this way and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
that. And from behind, the Platform came floating splendidly.</p>

<p>Tiny figures in space suits extended the incredibly straight
lines which were plastic hoses filled with air. Very, very
gently indeed, the great, bulbous Platform and the squat,
flat Moonship came together and touched. They moored in
contact.</p>

<p>And then the inert small missiles that had floated below, all
the way up, flared simultaneously. Their rockets emitted
smoke. In fine alignment, they plunged forward through
emptiness, swerved with a remarkable precision, and headed
out for emptiness beyond the Platform's orbit. Their function
had been to protect the Moonship on its way out. That function
was performed. There were too many of them to recover,
so they went out toward the stars.</p>

<p>When their rockets burned out they vanished. But a good
hour later, when it was considered that they were as far out
as they were likely to go, they began to blow up. Specks of
flame, like the tiniest of new stars, flickered against the background
of space.</p>

<p>But Joe and the others were in the Platform by then. They'd
brought up mail for the crew. And they were back on duty.</p>

<p>The Platform seemed strange with the Moonship's crew
aboard. It had been a gigantic artificial world with very few
inhabitants. With twenty-five naval ratings about, plus the
four of its regular crew, plus the space tug's complement, it
seemed excessively crowded.</p>

<p>And it was busy. There were twenty-five new men to be
guided as they applied what they'd been taught aground
about life in space. It was three full Earthdays before the
stores intended for the journey to the Moon and the maintenance
of a base there really began to move. The tug and the
space wagons had to be moored outside and reached only
by space suits through small personnel airlocks.</p>

<p>And there was the matter of discipline. Lieutenant Commander
Brown had been put in command of the Platform for
experience in space. He was considered to be prepared for
command of the Moonship by that experience. So now he
turned over command of the Platform to Brent&mdash;he made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
neat ceremony of it&mdash;and took over the ship that would go out
to the Moon. He made another ceremony out of that.</p>

<p>In command of the Moonship, his manner to Joe was absolutely
correct. He followed regulations to the letter&mdash;to a degree
that left Joe blankly uncomprehending. But he wouldn't
have gotten along in the Navy if he hadn't. He'd tried to do
the same thing in the Platform, and it wasn't practical. But he
ignored all differences between Joe and himself. He made no
overtures of friendship, but that was natural. Unintentionally,
Joe had defied him. He now deliberately overlooked all that,
and Joe approved of him&mdash;within limits.</p>

<p>But Mike and Haney and the Chief did not. They laid for
him. And they considered that they got him. When he took
over the Moonship, Lieutenant Commander Brown naturally
maintained naval discipline and required snappy, official
naval salutes on all suitable occasions, even in the Platform.
And Joe's gang privately tipped off the noncommissioned
personnel of the Moonship. Thereafter, no enlisted man ever
saluted Lieutenant Brown without first gently detaching his
magnet-soled shoes from the floor. When a man was free, a
really snappy salute gave a diverting result. The man's body
tilted forward to meet his rising arm, the upward impetus
was one-sided, and every man who saluted Brown immediately
made a spectacular kowtow which left him rigidly at salute
floating somewhere overhead with his back to Lieutenant
Brown. With a little practice, it was possible to add a somersault
to the other features. On one historic occasion, Brown
walked clanking into a storeroom where a dozen men were
preparing supplies for transfer to the Moonship. A voice cried,
"Shun!" And instantly twelve men went floating splendidly
about the storeroom, turning leisurely somersaults, all rigidly
at salute, and all wearing regulation poker faces.</p>

<p>An order abolishing salutes in weightlessness followed
shortly after.</p>

<p>It took four days to get the transfer of supplies properly
started. It took eight to finish the job. Affixing fresh rockets to
the outside of the Moonship's hull alone called for long hours
in space suits. During this time Mike floated nearby in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
space wagon. One of the Navy men was a trifle overcourageous.
He affected to despise safety lines. Completing the
hook-on of a landing rocket, he straightened up too abruptly
and went floating off toward the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Mike brought him back. After that there was less trouble.</p>

<p>Even so, the Moonship and the Platform were linked together
for thirteen full days, during which the Platform
seemed extraordinarily crowded. On the fourteenth day the
two ships sealed off and separated. Joe and his crew in the
space tug hauled the Moonship a good five miles from the
Platform.</p>

<p>The space tug returned to the Platform. A blinker signal
came across the five-mile interval. It was a very crisp, formal,
Navy-like message.</p>

<p>Then the newly-affixed rockets on the Moonship's hull
spurted their fumes. The big ship began to move. Not outward
from Earth, of course. That was where it was going.
But it had the Platform's 12,000 miles per hour of orbital
speed. If the bonds of gravitation could have been snapped
at just the proper instant, that speed alone would have carried
the Moonship all the way to its destination. But they couldn't.
So the Moonship blasted to increase its orbital speed. It would
swing out and out, and as the Earth's pull grew weaker with
distance the same weight of rockets would move the same mass
farther and farther toward the Moon. The Moonship's course
would be a sort of slowly flattening curve, receding from
Earth and becoming almost a straight line where Earth's and
the Moon's gravitational fields cancelled each other.</p>

<p>From there, the Moonship would have only to brake its
fall against a gravity one-sixth that of Earth, and reaching
out a vastly shorter distance.</p>

<p>Joe and the others watched the roiling masses of rocket
fumes as the ship seemed to grow infinitely small.</p>

<p>"We should've been in that ship," said Haney heavily when
the naked eye could no longer pick it out. "We could've beat
her to the Moon!"</p>

<p>Joe said nothing. He ached a little inside. But he reflected
that the men who'd guided the Platform to its orbit had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
overshadowed by himself and Haney and the Chief and Mike.
A later achievement always makes an earlier one look small.
Now the four of them would be forgotten. History would
remember the commander of the Moonship.</p>

<p>Forgotten? Yes, perhaps. But the names of the four of
them, Joe and Haney and the Chief and Mike, would still be
remembered in a language Joe couldn't speak, in a small village
he couldn't name, on those occasions when the Mohawk
tribe met in formal council.</p>

<p>The Chief grumbled. Mike stared out the port with bitter
envy.</p>

<p>"It was a dirty trick," growled the Chief. "We shoulda been
part of the first gang ever to land on the Moon!"</p>

<p>Joe grimaced. His crew needed to be cured of feeling the
same way he did.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say this outside of our gang," said Joe carefully,
"but if it hadn't been for us four that ship wouldn't be
on the way at all. Haney figured the trick that got us back to
Earth the first time, or else we'd have been killed. If we had
been killed, Mike wouldn't have figured out the metal-concrete
business. But for him, that Moonship wouldn't even be a
gleam in anybody's eye. And if the Chief hadn't blown up that
manned rocket we fought in the space wagons, there wouldn't
be any Platform up here to reload and refuel the Moonship. So
they left us behind! But just among the four of us I think we
can figure that if it hadn't been for us they couldn't have
made it!"</p>

<p>Haney grinned slowly at Joe. The Chief regarded him with
irony. Mike said, "Yeah. Haney, and me, and the Chief. We
did it all."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh," said the Chief sardonically. "Us three. Just us
three. Joe didn't do anything. Just a bum, he is. We oughta tell
Sally he's no good and she oughta pick herself out a guy that'll
amount to something some day." He hit Joe between the
shoulders. "Sure! Just a bum, Joe! That's all! But we got a
weakness for you. We'll let you hang around with us just
the same! Come on, guys! Let's get something to eat!"</p>

<p>The four of them marched down a steel-floored corridor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
their magnetic-soled shoes clanking on the plates. Their progress
was uncertain and ungainly and altogether undignified.
Suddenly the Chief began to bawl a completely irrelevant song
to the effect that the inhabitants of the kingdom of Siam were
never known to wash their dishes. Haney chimed in, and Mike.
They were all very close together, and they were not at all
impressive. But it hit Joe very hard, this sudden knowledge
that the others didn't really care. It was the first time it had
occurred to him that Haney and Mike and the Chief would
rather be left behind with him, as a gang, than go on to individual
high achievement in a first landing on the Moon.</p>

<p>It felt good. It felt <i>real</i> good.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But that, and all other sources of satisfaction, was wiped out
by news that came back from the Moonship a bare six hours
later.</p>

<p>The Moonship was in trouble. The sequence and timing of
its rocket blasts were worked out on Earth, and checked by
visual and radar observation. The computations were done by
electronic brains the Moonship could not possibly have carried.
And everything worked out. The ship was on course
and its firings were on schedule.</p>

<p>But then the unexpected happened. It was an error which
no machine could ever have predicted, for which statistics
and computations could never have compensated. It was a
<i>human</i> error. At the signal for the final acceleration blast, the
pilot of the Moonship had fired the wrong set of rockets.</p>

<p>Inexperience, stupidity, negligence, excitement&mdash;the reason
didn't matter. After years of planning and working and
dreaming, one human finger had made a mistake. And the
mistake was fatal!</p>

<p>When the mistake was realized, they'd had sense enough
to cut loose the still-firing rockets. But the damage had been
done. The ship was still plunging on. It would reach the
Moon. But it wouldn't land in Aristarchus crater as planned.
It would crash. If every rocket remaining mounted on the hull
were to be fired at the best possible instant, the Moonship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
would hit near Copernicus, and it would land with a terminal
velocity of 800 feet per second&mdash;540 miles an hour.</p>

<p>It could even be calculated that when the Moonship landed,
the explosion ought to be visible from Earth with a fairly
good telescope. It was due to take place in thirty-two hours
plus or minus a few minutes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>The others got the space tug into the platform's
lock and did things to it, in the way of loading, that
its designers never intended, while Joe was calling Earth for
calculations. The result was infuriating. The Moonship had
taken off for the Moon on the other side of the Platform's
orbit, when it had a velocity of more than 12,000 miles an
hour in the direction it wished to go. The Platform and of
course the space tug was now on the reverse side of the Platform's
orbit. And of course they now had a velocity of more
than 12,000 miles per hour away from the direction in which
it was urgently necessary for the space tug to go. They could
wait for two hours to take off, said Earth, or waste the time
and fuel they'd need to throw away to duplicate the effect of
waiting.</p>

<p>"But we can't wait!" raged Joe. Then he snapped. "Look
here! Suppose we take off from here, dive at Earth, make a
near-graze, and let its gravity curve our course! Like a
cometary path! Figure that! That's what we've got to do!"</p>

<p>He kicked off his magnetic-soled shoes and went diving
down to the airlock. Over his shoulder he panted an order
for the radar-duty man to relay anything from Earth down to
him there. He arrived to find Haney and Mike in hot argument
over whether it was possible to load on an extra ton or
two of mass. He stopped it. They would.</p>

<p>"Everything's loaded?" he demanded. "Okay! Space suits!
All set? Let's get out of this lock and start blasting!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>He drove them into the space tug. He climbed in himself.
He closed the entrance port. The plastic walls of the lock
bulged out, pulled back fast, and the steering rockets jetted.
The space tug came out of the lock. It spun about. It aimed
for Earth and monstrous bursts of rocket-trail spread out behind
it. It dived.</p>

<p>Naturally! When a ship from the Platform wanted to reach
Earth for atmosphere-deceleration, it was more economical
to head away from it. Now that it was the most urgent of all
possible necessities to get away from Earth, in the opposite direction
to the space tug's present motion, it was logical to dive
toward it. The ship would plunge toward Earth, and Earth's
gravity would help its rockets in the attainment of frenzied
speed. But the tug still possessed its orbital speed. So it would
not actually strike the Earth, but would be carried eastward
past its disk, even though aimed for Earth's mid-bulge. Yet
Earth would continue to pull. As the space tug skimmed past,
its path would be curved by the pull of gravity. At the nearest
possible approach to Earth, the tug would fire its heaviest
rockets for maximum acceleration. And it would swing around
Earth's atmosphere perhaps no more than 500 miles high&mdash;just
barely beyond the measurable presence of air&mdash;and come out of
that crazy curve a good hour ahead of the Platform for a
corresponding position, and with a greater velocity than could
be had in any other way. Traced on paper, the course of the
tug would be a tight parabola.</p>

<p>The ship dived. And it happened that it had left the Platform
and plunged deep in Earth's shadow, so that the look
and feel of things was that of an utterly suicidal plunge into
oblivion. There was the seeming of a vast sack of pure blackness
before the nose of the space tug. She started for it at
four gravities acceleration, and Joe got his headphones to his
ears and lay panting while he waited for the figures and information
he had to have.</p>

<p>He got them. When the four-gravity rockets burned out,
the tug's crew painstakingly adjusted the ship's nose to a
certain position. They flung themselves back into the acceleration
chairs and Joe fired a six-g blast. They came out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
that, and he fired another. The three blasts gave the ship a
downward speed of a mile and a half a second, and Earth's
pull added to it steadily. The Earth itself was drawing them
down most of a 4,000-mile fall, which added to the speed their
rockets built up.</p>

<p>Down on Earth, radar-bowls wavered dizzily, hunting for
them to feed them observations of position and data for their
guidance. Back on the Platform, members of the crew feverishly
made their own computations. When the four in the
Space tug were half-way to Earth, they were traveling faster
than any humans had ever traveled before, relative to the
Earth or the Platform itself. When they were a thousand
miles from Earth, it was certain they would clear its edge.
Joe proposed and received an okay to fire a salvo of Mark
Tens to speed the ship still more. When they burned to the
release-point and flashed away past the ports, the Chief and
Haney panted up from their chairs and made their way aft.</p>

<p>"Going to reload the firing-frames," gasped the Chief.</p>

<p>They vanished. The space tug could take rockets from its
cargo and set them outside its hull for firing. No other ship
could.</p>

<p>Haney and the Chief came back. There was dead silence
in the ship, save for a small, tinny voice in Joe's headphones.</p>

<p>"We'll pass Earth 600 miles high," said Joe in a flat voice.
"Maybe closer. I'm going to try to make it 450. We'll be smack
over enemy territory, but I doubt they could hit us. We'll be
hitting better than six miles a second. If we wanted to, we
could spend some more rockets and hit escape velocity. But
we want to stop, later. We'll ride it out."</p>

<p>Silence. Stillness. Speed. Out the ports to Earthward there
was purest blackness. On the other side, a universe of stars.
But the blackness grew and grew and grew until it neatly
bisected the cosmos itself, and half of everything that was,
was blackness. Half was tiny colored stars.</p>

<p>Then there was a sound. A faint sound. It was a moan.
It was a howl. It was a shriek.... And then it was a mere
thin moan again. Then it was not.</p>

<p>"We touched air," said Joe calmly, "at six and a quarter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
miles per second. Pretty thin, though. At that, we may have
left a meteor-trail for the populace to admire."</p>

<p>Nobody said anything at all. In a little while there was light
ahead. There was brightness. Instantly, it seemed, they were
out of night and there was a streaming tumult of clouds
flashing past below&mdash;but they were 800 miles up now&mdash;and
Joe's headphones rattled and he said:</p>

<p>"Now we can give a touch of course-correction, and maybe
a trace of speed...."</p>

<p>Rockets droned and boomed and roared outside the hull.
The Earth fell away and away and presently it was behind.
And they were plunging on after the Moonship which was
very, very, very far on before them.</p>

<p>It was actually many hours before they reached it. They
couldn't afford to overtake it gradually, because they had to
have time to work in after contact. But overtaking it swiftly
cost extra fuel, and they hadn't too much. So they compromised,
and came up behind the Moonship at better than
2,000 feet per second difference in speed&mdash;they approached
it as fast as most rifle-bullets travel&mdash;and all creation was
blotted out by the fumes of the rockets they fired for deceleration.</p>

<p>Then the space tug came cautiously close to the Moonship.
Mike climbed out on the outside of the tug's hull, with the
Chief also in space equipment, paying out Mike's safety-line.
Mike leaped across two hundred yards of emptiness with
light-years of gulf beneath him. His metal soles clanked on
the Moonship's hull.</p>

<p>Then the vision-screen on the tug lighted up. Lieutenant
Commander Brown looked out of it, quietly grim. Joe flicked
on his own transmitter. He nodded.</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Kenmore</i>," said Brown evenly, "<i>I did not contact you
before because I was not certain that contact could be made.
How many passengers can you take back to the Platform?</i>"</p>

<p>Joe blinked at him.</p>

<p>"I haven't any idea," he said. "But I'm going to hitch on
and use our rockets to land you."</p>

<p>"<i>I do not think it practicable</i>," said Brown calmly. "<i>I believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the only result of such a course will be the loss of both
ships with all hands. I will give you a written authorization to
return on my order. But since all my crew can't return, how
many can you take? I have ten married men aboard. Six have
children. Can you take six? Or all ten?</i>" Then he said without
a trace of emphasis, "<i>Of course, none of them will be officers.</i>"</p>

<p>"If I tried to turn back now, I think my crew would mutiny,"
Joe said coldly. "I'd hate to think they wouldn't,
anyhow! We're going to hook on and play this out the way
it lies!"</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then Brown spoke again. "<i>Mr. Kenmore,
I was hoping you'd say that. Actually&mdash;er&mdash;not to be
quoted, you understand&mdash;actually, intelligent defiance has
always been in the traditions of the Navy. Of course, you're
not in the Navy, Kenmore, but right now it looks like the
Navy is in your hands. Like a battleship in the hands of a tug.
Good luck, Kenmore.</i>"</p>

<p>Joe flicked off the screen. "You know," he said, winking
at Mike, "I guess Brown isn't such a bad egg after all. Let's
go!"</p>

<p>In minutes, the space tug had a line made fast. In half an
hour, the two space craft were bound firmly together, but
far enough apart for the rocket blasts to dissipate before they
reached the Moonship. Mike returned to the tug. A pair of the
big Mark Twenty rockets burned frenziedly in emptiness.</p>

<p>The Moonship was slowed by a fraction of its speed. The
deceleration was hardly perceptible.</p>

<p>There were more burnings. Back on Earth there were careful
measurements. A tight beam tends to attenuate when it
is thrown a hundred thousand miles. It tends to! When speech
is conducted over it, the lag between comment and reply is
perceptible. It's not great&mdash;just over half a second. But one
notices it. That lag was used to measure the speed and distance
of the two craft. The prospect didn't look too good.</p>

<p>The space tug burned rocket after rocket after rocket.
There was no effect that Joe could detect, of course. It would
have been like noticing the effect of single oar-strokes in a
rowboat miles from shore. But the instruments on Earth found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a difference. They made very, very, very careful computations.
And the electronic brains did the calculations which battalions
of mathematicians would have needed years to work out. The
electronic calculations which could not make a mistake said&mdash;that
it was a toss-up.</p>

<p>The Moon came slowly to float before the two linked ships.
It grew slowly, slowly larger. The word from Earth was that
considering the rockets still available in the space tug, and
those that should have been fired but weren't on the Moonship,
there must be no more blasts just yet. The two ships
must pass together through the neutral-point where the
gravities of Earth and Moon exactly cancel out. They must
fall together toward the Moon. Forty miles above the lunar
surface such-and-such rockets were to be fired. At twenty
miles, such-and-such others. At five miles the Moonship
itself must fire its remaining fuel-store. With luck, it was a
toss-up. Safety or a smash.</p>

<p>But there was a long time to wait. Joe and his crew relaxed
in the space tug. The Chief looked out a port and observed:</p>

<p>"I can see the ring-mountains now. Naked-eye stuff, too! I
wonder if anybody ever saw that before!"</p>

<p>"Not likely," said Joe.</p>

<p>Mike stared out a port. Haney looked, also.</p>

<p>"How're we going to get back, Joe?"</p>

<p>"The Moonship has rockets on board," Joe told him. "Only
they can't stick them in the firing-racks outside. They're
stowed away, all shipshape, Navy fashion. After we land, we'll
ask politely for rockets to get back to the Platform with.
It'll be a tedious run. Mostly coasting&mdash;falling free. But we'll
make it."</p>

<p>"If everything doesn't blow when we land," said the Chief.</p>

<p>Joe said uncomfortably: "It won't. Not that somebody won't
try." Then he stopped. After a moment he said awkwardly:
"Look! It's necessary that we humans get to the stars, or
ultimately we'll crowd the Earth until we won't be able to
stay human. We'd have to have wars and plagues and such
things to keep our numbers down. It&mdash;it seems to me, and I&mdash;think
it's been said before, that it looks like there's something,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
somewhere, that's afraid of us humans. It doesn't want us to
reach the stars. It didn't want us to fly. Before that it didn't
want us to learn how to cure disease, or have steam, or&mdash;anything
that makes men different from the beasts."</p>

<p>Haney turned his head. He listened intently.</p>

<p>"Maybe it sounds&mdash;superstitious," said Joe uneasily, "but
there's always been somebody trying to smash everything the
rest of us wanted. As if&mdash;as if something alien and hateful went
around whispering hypnotically into men's ears while they
slept, commanding them irresistibly to do things to smash all
their own hopes."</p>

<p>The Chief grunted. "Huh! D'you think that's new stuff,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"N-no," admitted Joe. "But it's true. Something fights us.
You can make wild guesses. Maybe&mdash;things on far planets
that know that if ever we reach there.... There's something
that hates men and it tries to make us destroy ourselves."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Haney mildly. "I learned about that in Sunday
School, Joe."</p>

<p>"Maybe I mean that," said Joe helplessly. "But anyhow
there's something we fight&mdash;and there's Something that fights
with us. So I think we're going to get the Moonship down all
right."</p>

<p>Mike said sharply: "You mean you think this is all worked
out in advance. That we'd be here, we'd get here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chief said impatiently, "It's figured out so we can do
it if we got the innards. We got the chance. We can duck it.
But if we duck it, it's bad, and somebody else has to have the
chance later. I know what Joe's saying. Us men, we got to
get to the stars. There's millions of 'em, and we need the
planets they've got swimming around 'em."</p>

<p>Haney said, "Some of them have planets. That's known.
Yeah."</p>

<p>"Those planets ain't going to go on forever with nobody
using 'em," grunted the Chief. "It don't make sense. And
things in general do make sense. All but us humans," he
finished with a grin. "And I like us, anyhow. Joe's right. We'll
get by this time. And if we don't&mdash;some other guys'll have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
do the job of landing on the Moon. But it'll be done&mdash;as a
starter."</p>

<p>"I can see lots of mountains down there. Plain," Mike said
quietly.</p>

<p>"What's the radar say?"</p>

<p>Joe looked. Back at the Platform it had shown the curve
of the surface of Earth. Here a dim line was beginning to
show on the vertical-plane screen. It was the curve of the
surface of the Moon.</p>

<p>"We might as well get set," said Joe. "We've got time but
we might as well. Space suits on. I'll tighten up the chain.
Steering rockets'll do that. Then we'll take a last look. All
firing racks loaded outside?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Haney. He grinned wrily. "You know, Joe, I
know what I know, but still I'm scared."</p>

<p>"Me, too," said Joe.</p>

<p>But there were things to do. They took their places. They
watched out the ports. The Moon had seemed a vast round
ball a little while back. Now it appeared to be flattening. Its
edges still curved away beyond a surprisingly nearby horizon.
The ring-mountains were amazingly distinct. There were incredibly
wide, smooth spaces with mottled colorings. But
the mountains....</p>

<p>When the ships were 40 miles high the space tug blasted
valorously, and all the panorama of the Moon's surface was
momentarily hidden by the racing clouds of mist. The rockets
burned out.</p>

<p>Haney and the Chief replaced the burned-out rockets. They
were gigantic, heavy-bore tubes which they couldn't have
stirred on Earth. Now they loaded them into the curious locks
which conveyed them outside the hull into firing position.</p>

<p>The ring-mountains were gigantic when they blasted again!
They were only 20 miles up, then, and some of the peaks
rose four miles from their inner crater floors.</p>

<p>The ships were still descending fast. Joe spoke into his
microphone.</p>

<p>"Calling Moonship! Calling&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
matter-of-factly, "I suggest we fire our last blast together.
Shall I give the word? Right!"</p>

<p>The surface of the Moon came toward them. Craters, cracks,
frozen fountains of stone, swelling undulations of ground interrupted
without rhyme or reason by the gigantic splashings
of missiles from the sky a hundred thousand million years
ago. The colorings were unbelievable. There were reds and
browns and yellows. There were grays and dusty deep-blues
and streaks of completely impossible tints in combination.</p>

<p>But Joe couldn't watch that. He kept his eyes on a very
special gadget which was a radar range-finder. He hadn't
used it about the Platform because there were too many tin
cans and such trivia floating about. It wouldn't be dependable.
But it did measure the exact distance to the nearest solid
object.</p>

<p>"Prepare for firing on a count of five," said Joe quietly.
"Five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... fire!"</p>

<p>The space tug's rockets blasted. For the first time since they
overtook the Moonship, the tug now had help. The remaining
rockets outside the Moonship's hull blasted furiously. Out the
ports there was nothing but hurtling whitenesses. The rockets
droned and rumbled and roared....</p>

<p>The main rockets burned out. The steering rockets still
boomed. Joe had thrown them on for what good their lift
might do.</p>

<p>"Joe!" said Haney in a surprised tone. "I feel weight! Not
much, but some! And the main rockets are off!"</p>

<p>Joe nodded. He watched the instruments before him. He
shifted a control, and the space tug swayed. It swayed over
to the limit of the tow-chain it had fastened to the Moonship.
Joe shifted his controls again.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar, gritty contact somewhere. Joe cut
the steering rockets and it was possible to look out. There were
more gritty noises. The space tug settled a little and leaned
a little. It was still. Then there was no noise at all.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Joe. "We've got some weight. We're on the
Moon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>They went out of the ship in a peculiarly solemn procession.
About them reared cliffs such as no man had ever looked on
before save in dreams. Above their heads hung a huge round
greenish globe, with a white polar ice-cap plainly visible. It
hung in mid-sky and was four times the size of the Moon as
seen from Earth. If one stood still and looked at it, it would
undoubtedly be seen to be revolving, once in some twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Mike scuffled in the dust in which he walked. Nobody had
emerged from the Moonship yet. The four of them were
literally the first human beings ever to set foot on the surface
of the Moon. But none of them mentioned the fact, though
all were acutely aware of it. Mike kicked up dust. It rose in
a curiously liquid-like fashion. There was no air to scatter it.
It settled deliberately back again.</p>

<p>Mike spoke with an odd constraint. "No green cheese," he
said absurdly.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Joe. "Let's go over to the Moonship. It looks
all right. It couldn't have landed hard."</p>

<p>They went toward the bulk of the ship from Earth, which
now was a base for the military occupation of a globe with
more land-area than all Earth's continents put together&mdash;but
not a drop of water. The Moonship was tilted slightly askew,
but it was patently unharmed. There were faces at every port
in the hull.</p>

<p>The Chief stopped suddenly. A sizable boulder rose from
the dust. The Chief struck it smartly with his space-gloved
hand.</p>

<p>"I'm counting coup on the Moon!" he said zestfully "Tie
that, you guys!"</p>

<p>Then he joined the others on their way to the Moonship's
main lock.</p>

<p>"Shall we knock?" asked Mike humorously. "I doubt they've
got a door-bell!"</p>

<p>But the lock-door was opening to admit them. They
crowded inside.</p>

<p>Commander Brown was waiting for them with an out-stretched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
hand. "Glad to have you aboard." And there was a
genuine smile creeping across his face.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Joe talked with careful distinctness into a microphone. His
voice took a little over a second to reach its destination. Then
there was a pause of the same length before the first syllable
of Sally's reply came to him from Earth.</p>

<p>"I've reported to your father," said Joe carefully, "and the
Moonship has reported to the Navy. In a couple of hours
Haney and the Chief and Mike and I will be taking off to go
back to the Platform. We got rockets from the stores of the
Moonship."</p>

<p>Sally's voice was surprisingly clear. It wavered a little, but
there was no sound of static to mar reception.</p>

<p>"Then what, Joe?"</p>

<p>"I'm bringing written reports and photographs and first
specimens of geology from the Moon," Joe told her. "I'm a
mailman. It'll probably be sixty hours back to the Platform&mdash;free
fall most of the way&mdash;and then we'll refuel and I'll come
down to Earth to deliver the reports and such."</p>

<p>Pause. One second and a little for his voice to go. Another
second and something over for her voice to return.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm trying to find out," said Joe. "What day
is today?"</p>

<p>"Tuesday," said Sally after the inevitable pause. "It's ten
o'clock Tuesday morning at the Shed."</p>

<p>Joe made calculations in his mind. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I ought to land on Earth some time next Monday."</p>

<p>Pause.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Sally.</p>

<p>"I wondered," said Joe. "How about a date that night?"
Another pause. Then Sally's voice. She sounded glad.</p>

<p>"It's a date, Joe. And&mdash;do you know, I must be the first girl
in the world to make a date with the Man in the Moon?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
